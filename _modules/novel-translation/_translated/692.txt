## The Trust Shattered
I can’t follow the conversation at all. 
Lee Baekho suddenly asks if he wants to kill him, and Jeina responds without hesitation, "Yes." What kind of relationship do they have?
"Oh, look at you rolling your eyes again?"
"..."
"P, please stop, Baekho. In this situation, fighting among ourselves will only benefit the bad guys who locked us in here!"
Aures, surprisingly, says something sensible and tries to smooth things over.
"Just shut up and stay put. You think I don't know you're still in touch with the Lord?"
"..."
"You, you, you, you, you, what, what are you saying! I, I—"
"Listen, you can't lie in here, okay?"
"..."
"But you didn't tell anyone about leaving this time, so I'm letting it go. You're off the hook."
"Th, thank you...."
Listening to their conversation, even the naive Aures seems to have a hidden agenda. 
'What the hell is wrong with these people? Why do they hang out together?' Apparently, 'comrade' has a completely different meaning for Lee Baekho than it does for me. 
"...Baron, shouldn't you do something about this? If this continues, we're going to split up...."
"Just stay quiet for now. If things get too serious, I'll step in."
The atmosphere turns icy in an instant. GM voices his concern, but I decide to observe the situation first.
It's true, isn’t it? At first, I didn’t understand why Baekho was so quick to distrust his own team.
'Well, if this is what's going on, I can see why he’d act that way.'  I almost believed they were close, but they're fundamentally different. 
They’re just working together because their goals align. 
These people aren’t ‘comrades’.
“Grandpa, … forget it. I knew you had an ulterior motive from the start.”
Baekho tries to say something to the Catastrophist, but lets out a sigh and shakes his head.
His eyes are filled with an air of weariness. Is he having an existential crisis or something?
Tick-tock.
At that moment, their shared trust, for whatever reason, reaches its expiration date.
“Enough of this. This proves that there’s no traitor among us.”
"..."
I’m not sure if this is the right time for another drama. Following the Catastrophist’s lead, Baekho pushes his misplaced trust back into his dimensional pocket. 
Of course, he adds a pointless remark:
“Thank goodness. It would’ve been a bit awkward if I had to kill someone I’d been hanging out with for years.”
Then, Baekho turns to Jeina and gives a sly smile. 
“You probably wouldn’t know what I’m talking about. You can’t even remember properly, can you?”
I can’t tell what the whole story is, but I can sense it. Those words are a dagger to someone’s heart.
Heavily, heavily, Jeina walks towards Baekho, body trembling, and stops a couple of steps away. Then…
“Why don’t you try hitting me?”
Looking up at Baekho, who is mocking her, Jeina sneers.
“Baekho… We are not your punching bags to vent your frustration on.”
"..."
“So save your tantrums for your mother.”
Her bold retort is enough to make both GM and Aures flinch.
“Oh, tantrums, are they? You’ll never be able to return to your world—.”
Jeina is about to touch a nerve when, in a flash, Baekho disappears from sight.
KWAANG—!
A deafening boom echoes, and a gust of wind sweeps across the chamber.
“Wow, this is getting interesting.”
The situation is simple. Baekho tried to attack Jeina, and Aures, standing nearby, blocked him with his shield.
“What is this? You’re talking about regaining your memories, but you already found someone to snuggle up to?”
Even for an outsider like me, the line is just too pathetic and cheesy for a villain. It’s as if I’ve seen the true bottom of Baekho’s character.
“Baekho, I understand you’re impatient, but regain your composure. This is not like you.”
“What’s ‘like me’?”
“You’re always fickle and demanding, but you’ve never been this reckless.”
Aures stands his ground, staring directly into Baekho's eyes, ready to punch him in the face. 'Yeah, this is what a tank is supposed to do.' There’s no such thing as a bad tank. ***
“...Ugh, I need some air.”
As Baekho leaves the room, as if he's running away, Aures lets out a long sigh of relief.
“Whew…. Baekho’s bloodlust is always so terrifying. I thought I was going to die!”
“Haha, but you didn’t flinch. You’ve earned my respect.”
“Haha… It’s just that I need to protect my comrades. But how could I back down…?”
“...Thank you.”
Aures scratches the back of his head, embarrassed after Jeina expresses her gratitude in a small voice.
“Then, will you all go first? I’ll take some time to cool down and come down later.”
“O, o, o, o! Really?”
What do you mean ‘really’? Before Aures can say anything more, I quickly interrupt.
“Solo actions are forbidden. There’s no guarantee that this place is safe.”
“O… but Baekho just left by himself, didn’t he?”
You know you can’t talk back to me like that.  You think you’re Baekho or the priest?
“If it’s a problem, then I’ll stay with her. That’s fine, right?”
Ugh. He’s got me there. I have no answer to that. 'This guy, can he argue this logically and he hasn’t been doing it this whole time?'
Although he’s being pretty clever, I have no intention of letting him go.
“No.”
“Why not?”
There are many reasons. Firstly, leaving my only priest with him is a bad idea, and… 
“You said it was a problem being alone. That’s why I’m going to stay with her. What’s the problem now?”
Secondly, it’s just him.  If we add romantic drama to an already fractured team, we'll have a full-blown disaster.
“Answer me properly. Otherwise, I won’t back down—.”
Ugh, you’re being so loud.
“Then you guys go first. I’ll stay here.”
He seems determined to refuse unless I give him a reason, so I decide to stay instead. 
“O, oh? Th, that’s actually… ”
Aures looks startled, just as I expected.
“It’s alright, Aures. I'll be down soon, don’t worry.”
“...Understood.”
As Jeina echoes my words, Aures seems to run out of things to say, and with a slumped posture, he leaves. Then…
“Interesting person, isn’t he?”
Jeina speaks to me once we’re alone.
“He's always been like that. Always looking at me while he’s messing around.”
“Did you know?”
“How could I not? He’s so obvious about it.”
Really? Honestly, I didn’t notice until today.
"Anyway, it’s just us again.”
“Right, it seems we’ve ended up alone together again. I'm going to stay quiet now, so you can figure out what’s on your mind.”
I sit with my legs crossed near the entrance, and Jeina leans against the wall. 
Silence.
As I contemplate and munch on jerky, she speaks up.
“...Aren’t you going to ask?”
It feels like a random question, but there’s no problem with the communication itself.
“Didn’t you say you needed some time alone?”
“But we aren’t alone. We’re together.”
Hmm, that's true. 
“So if I ask, will you tell me?”
She replies to my blunt question just as bluntly.
“There’s nothing I can't tell you.  It’s not something I’d bring up myself, but it's not like I'm hiding it either.”
"..."
“And wasn’t that why you stayed? Because you were curious?”
Well, that’s one reason, I guess.
“The main reason is different.”
“What is it?”
“It would be a real headache if we started a relationship in this situation.”
An honest answer, without any pretense.  Jeina laughs, surprised, then abruptly changes the subject. 
“No, actually, I don’t want to tell you.”
“...What? Why?”
“Never mind. It’s not that interesting a story.”
“Is that so? Suit yourself.”
Ugh, I got my hopes up. I feel deflated and sigh.
But does she feel a twinge of guilt at my dejected look?
“But I’ll tell you one thing. I lied to you before. Or rather, I intentionally left out a part of the story.”
“What part?”
“The person I was trying to save, the one I offered my memories to Karui for. It was me who killed him. Well, Baekho told you that, so you probably figured it out.”
“Can I hear how that happened?”
“There’s no big reason. Karui just demanded that he be a sacrifice. She promised me a new power in exchange, so I killed him.”
"..."
“It was a very powerful ability, one that saved my life multiple times. But… I wouldn’t have done it. If I had known it would make me this uneasy, I never would have… ”
I can hear the deep regret in Jeina’s voice, so I decide to give her some time. 
Ten minutes, twenty minutes, thirty minutes pass before Jeina stands up. She tells me she’s alright now and heads down to the chamber below.
“Are you feeling better now?”
Aures approaches as we enter the ruins. They’re having a conversation, but I don’t bother listening in.
“Where’s Baekho?”
I ask GM, but all I get is that he hasn’t returned yet. Ugh, what is he, a teenager?
“Should we search for him?”
“Forget it. If we wait, he'll come back on his own.”
“But we might not be alone. There could be someone else in these ruins.”
“Let's wait a bit longer. If he’s still gone, we can search then.”
Besides, there’s a conversation I need to have with the Catastrophist when Baekho’s not around.
“Hey.”
I leave my conversation with GM and approach the Catastrophist.
“What is it, Baron?”
“There’s something I want to discuss with you.”
“Tell me.”
He’s not the talkative type, so I get straight to the point.
“Baekho, did he seem normal to you?”
It’s something I've been thinking about since the beginning. Even if Baekho isn’t normal, he doesn’t usually act this recklessly.
He always makes sure he gets something ‘beneficial’ out of everything he does.
“He’s probably not normal. You seem to think so too.”
“You also noticed something was off, right?”
“His benchmark is not ‘good’ or ‘evil’. He always tries to think and act rationally in any situation. But what happened today was just too emotional.”
“Maybe he was feeling impatient, so he acted like that?”
“That’s absurd. If he were the type to feel impatient about something like this, he wouldn’t have been able to pursue a single goal for almost twenty years.”
“I see… ”
If that's not it, then what could have made Baekho act like that? Is there some unknown field effect at play? But if that's the case, everyone else is perfectly fine, except for Baekho?
As I’m pondering, the Catastrophist walks over to me and brings up a different topic. 
“Speaking of which, I have another question.”
“What is it?”
“It's something I’ve been thinking about as I’ve been trying to make sense of the situation.  I’ve come to the conclusion that there must have been an inside man after all.”
“Didn’t we solve that already?”
We even used the Broken Trust ability, and we checked not only Baekho’s team but even GM.
I couldn’t use the ability because it doesn’t work on me. But why is he bringing this up again?
“You don’t think… you’re suspecting me and Baekho?”
I ask in a hushed voice, because I can’t think of any other answer. 
The Catastrophist chuckles.
“Not exactly.  While you definitely have the motivation to hinder us… there’s a more suspicious person than you.”
