## The Abandoned City (2) 
After putting Subordinate G in the basement and drawing the curtains, creating a dimly lit living room, we gathered for a free discussion. 
"The situation isn't good," began Versil, the first to speak. "Soon, the patrol group that discovered us will realize they've lost track.  Then the full-scale search will begin. It's only a matter of time before they find us here."
It was indeed dangerous to remain in this house. 
Even with our strength, we'd be powerless against a full-scale siege. I'd felt it during the Ice Rock Expedition, but Orculis and Noirch's top raiders were not to be underestimated.  
"They must be even more elite now, having continued to push forward after conquering the 8th floor," I thought. 
Nodding in agreement with Versil, I said, "Don't worry. I have no intention of hiding here.  We need to find a way out as quickly as possible."
"That's reassuring." 
Our objective was clear: escape the 7th precinct controlled by Noirch.  Naturally, the discussion focused on that goal.
"I heard the 13th precinct is also under their control, right?  It'll be difficult for them to handle the entire wall with their forces alone." 
"So we need to find a weak spot and break through." 
"Yes!  Once we get over the wall, we'll be among our allies."  Erwen's strategy was to force a breach.
"What about using the sewers?  The passageways are narrow, so it'll be manageable even if we're discovered," suggested Misha, advocating a detour.
"Why don't we just hide and wait?  The royal forces will come to save us soon enough," offered Ainar, lacking in fighting spirit, opting for a strategy of passive endurance.
And then... 
"Auyen, it's your turn.  Don't just sit there." 
"Me?  You want me to speak?" 
"I'm not asking for a perfect solution.  Just tell us what you'd do if you had the strength.  Don't feel pressured."
"If I had the strength… I think I would try to rescue the people."
"People?"
"Yes… I heard most of the explorers in the 7th precinct have been taken hostage by them."
Even Auyen, the navigator, offered an unexpected opinion.
"Of course, I'm far from being a hero! I was just saying…" 
When all eyes turned to him, Auyen stammered, trying to downplay his words. 
But... 
"Not bad," Amelia said, looking at me.  "Jandel, this might be our chance.  They don't know we're here.  They're only focused on the royal forces outside the wall."
"You mean we should attack them from within?"
"Yes, if we succeed, we'll achieve a tremendous feat.  Two of Lavigion's cities have fallen to external enemies.  Maybe we'll be recognized as heroes, as great as the nobles who repelled the Duke of Heaven during the Iron Wall Crisis."
Amelia's words did make sense. 
Even in the long history of Lafradonia, such a massive event was rare. 
If we succeeded, we would not only receive countless rewards, but also a promotion.  My position in the Melves, the interracial noble alliance I'd joined, would be significantly elevated. 
"...I need to hear more.  Auyen, bring the guy from the basement." 
My mind churned with possibilities. 
***
Subordinate G, released after being briefly confined in the basement, answered our questions as if he were on our side.  
Thanks to him, we gained a better understanding of the situation in the 7th precinct...
"The explorers are being held in various locations," he informed us.
Given their abilities exceeding those of ordinary citizens, explorers, who typically act as the city's standing army, were confined to three main locations:
The basement dungeon of the Explorers' Guild, where I was once imprisoned.
The basement dungeons of the Trisin temples.
And the basement dungeon of the 7th precinct's law enforcement office.
Of course, these were just the main locations.  There were dozens more if you counted them all.  The 7th precinct alone had several temples and Explorer Guild branches, not to mention the various subordinate departments of the law enforcement office.
"They had no choice but to divide and imprison the explorers, as there were so many of them…."
This was a mixed bag. 
"It might actually be easier to rescue them since their forces are spread out...,"  I mused.
But on the other hand, our presence would be exposed to the world if we went to just a few places.  There was a distance between each dungeon, even if we moved quickly.
"Still, it's a positive that our strength will increase each time we visit a place."
"Yes...? Are you seriously going to rescue them...?" 
"Why are you so curious?"
"..."
We then inquired about the patrol routes and the number of troops stationed on the wall.  It was too much to expect that a lowly subordinate like this could explain everything in detail... 
"Oh, and the civilians are being kept near the wall.  They're being released bit by bit as the royal forces' pressure mounts, and a stalemate continues," he added.
Even a little information was better than none.
"Alright, go back to your house."
"...My house?"
"Auyen will guide you."
After returning Subordinate G to the basement, we held a final discussion.
"From your expression, you seem to have already made a decision." 
"...Can you tell?" 
"To some degree.  So what's the plan?"
She didn't ask out of curiosity, so I answered directly without hesitation.
"We'll free the hostages and escape this city together."
"How?"
Amelia asked succinctly, and I replied without a moment's delay.
"We'll figure it out now."
"..."
"Together."
We had decided, based on the feasibility, but we hadn't developed a detailed plan.  It's always better to brainstorm together than to make decisions alone, especially when it came to these details. 
"Alright, let's start."
We discussed various aspects of the plan, such as which prison to target first, which route to take, whether to climb over the wall or go through the sewers, and if we chose the wall, which point would be optimal.  We were making progress, slowly but surely.
"But..."  Misha spoke softly, interrupting the discussion as a moment of silence descended.
"Don't you find it a bit… strange?"  She muttered, lacking a subject in her sentence.
Erwen, her eyes narrowed, questioned, "Strange? What do you mean?"
"It's just… I don't understand what Noirch's goal is. There are so many aspects that just don't make sense."
"It's pretty obvious what they want.  They want to take what's ours, become masters of the world," Erwen retorted.
"Yes, but..." Misha pressed on. "They must know this is nothing more than a delaying tactic.  Holding hostages won't change anything.  So why would they invade like this?"
Erwen didn't disagree.  
To be honest, the question Misha had raised was something we all pondered to a certain extent.
Noirch could never win with the current situation.  Even if they had dozens of times more hostages, the royal forces weren't the type to hesitate to draw their swords out of fear of bloodshed. 
And... 
"Noirch must know that."
This invasion was doomed to fail.  
But why would Noirch commit such a foolish act?
Were they just too stupid to think that far ahead?
No way.
"It's also suspicious that they targeted two precincts at the same time.  Even attacking one precinct is risky, considering how long they can hold out..."
"It's even harder to defend, considering the Bifron is between the 7th and 13th precincts."
"...I wonder why.  Do they have some kind of ulterior motive with the Bifron?"
"I'm not sure, but it's clear that their movements have a purpose."
Yeah, this is getting suspicious.  It's reasonable to assume they have a hidden plan.
"Then what about the hostage situation?"
"They probably need time to continue their plans."
"Then we need to move as quickly as possible.  We can't even imagine what might happen if they have enough time."
Indeed, two heads are better than one.
While discussing this, we also realized that we have a limited time frame.  We don't know how much time is left.  
Still, everyone was aware that we needed to act quickly.
"...Alright, we've established the routes. Has everyone memorized it?"
"Ah, I haven't..."
"It's fine, Ainar.  You just need to stay next to Versil."
"Oh, really?"
Yeah, I wasn't expecting her to memorize it anyway.  It's best to keep Ainar next to someone smart.
"Alright, everything is prepared.  Let's go."
Just as we were ready to leave, my brain, programmed to remember every oath I ever made, couldn't help but remember that one thing.
"Bjorn!  What about the guy in the basement? You swore to spare him!"
Ugh, why does my brain remember this useless stuff.  I couldn't show Ainar, who doesn't know I'm a player, that I'm easily breaking an oath, but luckily, it didn't become a major issue. 
"What's the problem? I did spare him."
"..."
"So do I have to feed him, take care of him, and constantly keep him by my side?"
"Well… no…"
"Then that's it.  Leave him be.  He'll figure things out. If he starves, that's his fate."
"Oh… I guess so."
"Ainar! Stop talking nonsense and go stand next to Versil! That's your spot!"
"Got it!!"
Alright, I've managed to convince Ainar.
Creak, boom!
Let's go. 
***
We left the dilapidated house and moved as discreetly as possible to avoid the eyes of the patrols.  
Judging from their movements, they still haven't discovered us.
"This way."
Amelia, by the way, took on the role of a guide.  She's practically an expert when it comes to stealth and infiltration.   Following her instructions, we stopped when we needed to, moved when we needed to, and arrived at our destination precisely as planned. 
"As expected, the guards are not that numerous."
The Temple of Leatlass, a place I've visited often.  
It was also the starting point of today's escape plan.
We watched from the second floor of the building across the street, beginning our operation in earnest.  
It was only waiting, for me, though.
"We'll be back."
Amelia, skilled in stealth, and Misha, equipped with an invisibility item, were in charge of sneaking in, along with Erwen, capable of long-range assassination.  This three-person strike force left the building, and soon after, we received the signal.
We left the building and headed towards the main entrance.  The guards who had been stationed there were all lying unconscious.
Shhh- shh- shh- 
Amelia used her exploration tools to perfectly clean up any traces, and then we entered the temple.
And then…
Puff!  Whack!  Whist!
Following Amelia, we repeated the process.
But as they say, if you have a long tail, it will get caught.
"I think… we've been discovered?"
Erwen muttered, and Amelia frowned, nodding.
"It seems so.  Considering the commotion."
They called it a commotion, but I couldn't hear anything.
...Not that I don't believe them.
"How did they find us?"
"Who knows?  There are always people with mysterious abilities around.  We'll talk about it later.  Let's just speed things up for now."
"Alright."
Ugh, I hoped we could wrap this up quietly and have some time to spare.
"The royal forces!  They've invaded!"
Just as we reached the stairs leading down to the basement where the prison was located, the troops stationed in the temple appeared and attacked.
Killing them all before going down was an option, but not a time-efficient one.
"Jandel, we'll take care of this floor, go down."
"Alright."
I left the ground floor to my comrades and rushed downstairs.
The basement dungeon was much larger than the ground floor.  
Except for one, the guards who were supposed to be working in shifts were nowhere to be seen.
"Don't come any closer!"
The guard seemed to have heard the news from above and was even holding a weapon, ready to greet me. 
Whack!
With a swift swing of my hammer, I crushed the guard's head.  The explorers who were imprisoned immediately grasped the situation.
"The rescue team...?"
"Why is it just one person...?"
"Wait... this place feels familiar..."
"Baron Jandel!  It's Baron Jandel!"
"The giant is here...!!!"
The screams echoing from the basement were deafening, but I took it as a positive thing.
At least they had the strength to scream.
This was a chance to earn their favor.
"Wait!  I'm Bjorn, son of Jandel, and I'm here to save you!"
"Wooooaaaahhh!!!"
After I had secured their gratitude, I searched the fallen guard's waist for the key.
"...There's no key?"
An unexpected situation, but I didn't panic.  
There's no problem in this world that can't be solved.
As long as you have enough strength.
Crack!
With a little force, the bars bent like spoons.
"Th, thank you! Thank you!"
"Did the royal forces send you, Baron?"
"I heard you were missing."
The explorers, freed from their confinement, started asking all sorts of questions.
Their favor was appreciated, but I didn't have time to answer them all.
"Okay, we'll talk later.  Give me your hand."
"Ah…! Yes!"
I used my bare hands to release the shackles they were wearing, cracking them open like nuts.  Since it was a magical device that sealed their essence, its physical durability was low.
"Now that you're free, get to the upper floors and help.  Don't block the way."
"Uh…  I wonder if my equipment…."
"Ask them above.  I don't know."
"Yes!"
Since I didn't need to waste time looking for keys one by one, I used brute force to resolve everything.  The release operation finished much faster than expected.
But...
"Downstairs!  There are priests and mages on the second floor!"
Oh, there's a second floor? 
I wonder why there were only regular explorers here. 
"I'm Bjorn, son of Jandel, and I'm here to rescue you!"
I repeated the same routine on the second floor, earning their favor while rescuing them.
When I returned upstairs, the ground floor had also been cleared.
"Sir, you worked hard."
"You're the ones who worked hard.  Now, priests!  Are there any priests above the rank of bishop?  The more, the better!"
I gathered all the priests above the rank of bishop from among the freed explorers.  Fortunately, there were more than 10 priests of that rank, considering the location.
"...Are you injured?"
"I'm not injured.  I need your help with the next part of the plan."
"Ah, yes! We will do our best.  What do you need us to do?"
"Pray for us."
"Pray…  for you...?"
The priests looked at me as if I had said something absurd.  I smirked and said,
"I want to erase my essence." 
"..."
"Right now."
You need to be strong before you can do great things, right?
