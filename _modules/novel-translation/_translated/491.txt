## The Declaration of War (2)
The Monument of Honor.
A colossal, towering obelisk, its presence dominating the central plaza of the Imperial City, Karnon. Rumored to have been crafted at the dawn of the Dimensional Plaza, the obelisk was said to hold a chronicle of the deeds of every hero who had risen and fallen throughout its long history.
“Wasn’t the last inscription 600 years ago…?”
These accomplishments were not recorded by mortal hands. The monument, a relic forged with forgotten ancient magic, had a profound connection to the Labyrinth itself.  Upon the completion of a noteworthy feat within its depths, the monument would automatically inscribe it onto its surface.
“…That was the lore, anyway.”
A sense of bewilderment washed over me.
In the game, the Monument of Honor was nothing more than a mere decorative element. After all, it had never once activated during my decade of gameplay. It was merely a prop designed to showcase the world's lore.
But…
“To think this thing actually worked.”
Arriving at the plaza under the watchful eyes of a retinue of knights, I lifted my gaze and surveyed the scene. The outer rim of the plaza, under the control of the knights, was teeming with onlookers. As expected from the citizens of Imperial Karnon, many were nobles, impeccably dressed.
“Baron Bjorn Yandell! Baron Bjorn Yandell!”
“Whoa-ho-ho-ho!”
I felt like a caged monkey put on display.
But, I maintained my composure, silently gazing upwards at the obelisk.
The inscription at the very top read:
[The Last Archmage, Diphlun Groundel Gavrillius, and his companions vanquished all creatures in the Crystal Caves and opened the hidden path.]
According to history books, it was at this precise moment that four portals leading to the second layer of the Labyrinth were created.
The following inscriptions held a similar feel.
[Emon Mulmarin, a valiant warrior of the Beastkin race, and his companions slew the Sea Dragon and discovered a new island.]
The moment an explorer first defeated the boss monster, a previously nonexistent island emerged.
[Ordell Pickma, the Great Navigator, and his companions vanquished all creatures in the Great Sea and opened the hidden path.]
When someone flawlessly conquered the sixth layer, two pathways leading to the seventh appeared.
[The Human Explorer, Rudeel Lemenin, and his companions reached the Abyss, awakening the spirits of all the Monarchs.]
The summoning of the Layer Monarchs also began after the first individual reached the tenth layer. And following their defeat, rifts started to appear on the corresponding floors.
The Iron Hero, Juggernaut.
That was the first person to ever slay a Layer Monarch, wasn’t it?
Regardless, that’s not the important part.
From my perspective as a gamer, the Monument of Honor was essentially a patch note.
Every time something significant changed within the Labyrinth, the monument would record it, heralding it as a heroic deed.
And that meant…
[The Great Barbarian Warrior, Bjorn Yandell, and his companions vanquished the Dread Lord, Dreadfear, and opened the hidden path.]
This truly indicated the opening of a new area.
Was this a good thing, or a bad thing?
I remained lost in contemplation, my gaze fixed on the obelisk.
"Baron Yandell! Could you please look this way?"
A man who appeared to be an official made this request, and I turned my head involuntarily.
Click-!
A flash erupted from the video recorder the man held in his hand.
“Give us a smile! This moment will be forever recorded in the annals of history!"
The annals of history…
‘Well, it’s not bad, I guess.’
As someone who needed to cultivate a broad base of support, such an event was definitely positive.
Having completed this calculation of gains and losses, I activated [Gigantification], spread my arms wide, and roared.
"Behel—raaaaaaaagh!"
As expected, another flash erupted.
Click-!
That shot should be an A-cut.
***
「Your character's renown has increased by +10.」
「Your character's renown has increased by +10.」
「Your character's renown has increased by +10…」
「… 」
「… 」

Having my name etched onto the Monument of Honor was a far greater issue than I had anticipated.
After the Royal Photographer, whose identity I only learned later, snapped countless pictures of me in front of the obelisk for the perfect A-cut,
[The photo taken in the daytime is the best, wouldn't you say!]
I was summoned to the Royal Scribe’s office for what was essentially an interrogation. 
No, had I not been a noble, it would have been an actual interrogation.
[Oh, yes… I can’t disclose that information, you see.]
[To an explorer, experience and knowledge are treasures. But why should I give it to you for free?]
[…Well, the Labyrinth Decree clearly states that you can't force the Baron, but… for the sake of the Kingdom, and for our descendants, wouldn't you reconsider?]
[I don’t know, I saw that other veterans weren’t exactly forthcoming either.]
[Well, that… ]
[I’m hungry. I’m going now!]
When I stepped out of the house that evening, the world around me had changed.
The first time I gained notoriety and was dubbed “Little Balkan.”
The time I earned great merit in the Noark Battle.
The moments I became a Junior Baron and then a full Baron.
On those occasions, I also felt as if the world around me had transformed overnight. But it was nothing compared to this.
“B-Bjorn Yandell…!”
Every time I took a step on the street, people would swarm me.
From a distance, a parent with a child on their shoulders would plead for Bjorn to call out the child’s name, even just once. Some would even hug me, going beyond a simple handshake.
‘What the…'
It wasn’t like this hadn’t happened before, but it was drastically different.
This was Karnon.
The upper-class citizens of Karnon had viewed me with interest but never with reverence. And needless to say, the nobles were no different.
But now?
“Giant! The Giant!”
“The great Giant who will usher in a new era…!”
“Light shines upon Lafonia!”
People belonging to the upper echelons were excitedly calling out like crazed fans.
Upon reflection, it made sense.
A person with the potential to be a hero and a true hero are different.
“To think… that such a hero would be born in my lifetime.”
The Archmage, Gavrillius.
The Abyssal Searcher, Lemenin.
The Great Navigator, Pickma.
The Iron Hero, Juggernaut.
It could be considered the value of the names of my predecessors inscribed on the Monument of Honor. Being a contemporary of individuals who were remembered throughout history and whose names still echoed in the annals of time?
Simply being in the same space as them would evoke a feeling of sharing in a historical moment.
So I did my best to offer some fan service.
“Honey! The Baron called out our child’s name…!”
“This child will grow up to be great! I’m sure of it!”
The Barbarian Pope, Mode.
This continued until I reached the platform, and even after boarding the carriage, people chased after me, shouting, making it impossible to get a wink of sleep.
And so, I arrived home.
“Wooooooaaaaah!”
I didn’t know how the news spread so quickly.
The people gathered in front of my house were shouting like it was a festival. It was only after the knights from Mozlan arrived and started controlling the crowd that the clamor finally subsided.
“Whew… finally quiet.”
As I sighed and slumped onto the sofa, Erwen, who had been peering out of the slightly opened curtains, approached me.
"They finally left."
“This is insane. If it's this bad today, I can’t even imagine tomorrow.”
“It will calm down soon, I think. People are surprisingly… quick to forget.”
“Like when I was supposedly dead?”
“…Yeah.”
Erwen then sat opposite me, and, as if waiting for this moment, Auyen brought me some tea.
“Ah, thanks.”
“You’re welcome, Captain.”
Auyen’s voice and gaze were different from usual.
He had always been polite, but today, an indescribable sense of respect emanated from him.
“I guess it was fate that I met you, Captain, and now I’m repenting and serving you. I will be your most humble servant, doing whatever I can to assist you in your endeavors.”
Does this guy think he's some kind of baggage carrier for a hero party?
It was amusing, but I didn't say anything.
"Well, good night then."
After Auyen left, Versil and Amelia entered the room together.
“Sorry. It's all my fault you couldn't even relax at home.”
"No, it’s fine. I’m glad I stayed and didn’t go back. It would have been hard to come again tomorrow, with this situation. Plus, I was tired anyway.”
“Well… that’s true.”
To be honest, it still didn’t feel real.
They were all talking about achievements and heroes. Was this really something worthy of being inscribed onto the Monument of Honor?
It was just that, by chance, a hidden piece activated, leading to my first trial, and luckily, I succeeded.
To be honest, the Ice Rock expedition was several times more difficult.
People were dying left and right, and…
‘Actually, that was a lot harder.’
“Anyway, did you get any sleep?”
“No… I couldn’t sleep. Don’t worry about it. It’s only a seven-day schedule anyway. It was mostly a rest schedule, except for the last day.”
Well, that's true.
Usually, people come back from the Labyrinth and just pass out from exhaustion, but I’m still relatively fine.
Ainar is the only one who is sound asleep.
"So, I took some time to examine… ”
Versil began, placing ‘No.12 Trust’ on the table. It was the item I had handed her before leaving for Karnon with the knights.
“It's now bound to a soul.”
"Bound?"
“Yes. But it’s a bit unusual in that it’s multi-bound. It seems like only me, Pnelin, Tersia, and Yandell can use it.”
Versil then demonstrated by placing the bracelet on Amelia’s wrist. The bracelet fell off without fitting together.
“It can only be used by those who have undergone a trial.”
"Yes. It seems highly likely."
"Hmm…"
Seeing me deep in thought, Versil cautiously asked.
“So… it looks like one of us four needs to use it. What do you think?”
First off, ‘Trust’ is a versatile item.
It’s so versatile that it’s pointless to consider class. It’s effective for tanks, damage dealers, mages, and priests alike.
It has three uses:
1. Immunity to damage inflicted by allied characters in a bound state.
If a tank uses it, they can take a barrage of AoE damage without even a scratch.
This solves the chronic problem of tanks and allows for more diverse tactics.
2. Increased damage based on the number of allied characters in a bound state.
If a damage dealer uses it, their damage output will be boosted.
3. All beneficial effects bestowed on allied characters in a bound state are increased by 2x.
If a priest or support-type explorer wears it, their abilities are doubled.
‘Our case is going to have to exclude number 3.’
Ultimately, we’re left with two uses.
Give it to Erwen, who’s now an Another Class, and boost her damage output.
Or, equip it myself and enhance the party’s stability.
‘Come to think of it, there’s no reason to even think about it.’
If there are two dishes on the table, a Barbarian’s spirit is to grab both and eat them.
I finally made my decision.
I’ll wear it normally, and when I need more damage, I’ll pass it over to Erwen.
“Depending on the situation, I’m also thinking of passing it onto you, Versil, or Ainar.”
My teammates nodded in agreement.
Only Amelia’s expression was slightly off.
A subtle shift in her usually stoic demeanor.
“Right, well, that’s that then. You guys go get some rest. We’ll talk more about the rest tomorrow. Oh, and Emily, you stay for a bit.”
Versil and Erwen, having picked up on Amelia’s subtle change in expression, left the room without saying a word.
Just the two of us were left.
Amelia sat down on the sofa, where she had been standing beside me.
“If I’d known it was going to be like this, I wouldn’t have bothered with that interrogation.”
Well, from her perspective, it must have been a bit disappointing.
She didn’t even get to use the loot she had obtained, and her name wasn’t included among “his companions” inscribed on the Monument of Honor.
Instead of offering hollow words of comfort, I went with a realistic approach.
“Think positive. It would have been a problem if your name had been on there.”
I saw that the names of the team members, who were omitted with just the word “companions,” were inscribed at the end of the record in small letters as an addendum.
Simply put, if Amelia hadn’t left the team, her real name, “Amelia Rainwels,” would have been exposed.
"I know that."
“You do?”
“I was just… a little bummed.”
“…What?”
As I tilted my head, Amelia stared at me and said.
“It means that I can’t stay by your side with my real name.”
“Oh…”
Uh, well…
As I struggled to find the right words, Amelia, as if she had just made a passing remark, changed the subject.
“Yandell, I have information you need to know.”
“The thing you were going to tell me later?”
"Yes."
Honestly, that’s why I asked her to stay, but seeing her serious expression, I felt a wave of anxiety.
"What is it? Tell me."
"There’s something wrong with my memory."
“…What?”
At first, I thought she was being ridiculous, but after hearing the rest of her story, I realized that this was a serious situation.
“After the interrogation was over, I felt a bit dazed. When I came to, my video recorder was broken. I’m sure I didn’t pass out.”
"So?"
“I compared the flow of time in my memory to the actual time, and there’s a discrepancy.”
It was about 10 minutes.
For example, I remember the interrogation lasting 35 minutes, but in reality, 45 minutes had passed.
“Could it be a mistake?”
"No."
Whew, if she’s this sure, there must have been a problem.
“Moreover, when I thought back, I noticed some irregularities in my memory. There were certain points that I would have checked thoroughly if it had been me, but in my memory, I just brushed past them.”
“… ”
“So, I considered the possibility of a hallucination spell. I thought that perhaps someone might have manipulated my memories and filled them in.”
"And?"
“I still don’t know about this part. I got Gowlend to check, but she said there was no trace of that kind of magic.”
Memory manipulation…
Who could the perpetrator be?
Is there a mage of that caliber under Earl Alminers?
Or is it a third party entirely?
As I was deep in thought, Amelia added cautiously.
“There’s one more thing. When I came to and started checking everything, all my weapons were spotless.”
“…Weapons?”
"Yes, even the sword that was used to stab you. They were all clean, like they had been wiped down."
This is suspicious, for sure.
What the hell happened?
While I felt a sense of relief that Amelia was safe, I added more things to my to-do list.
“They said they got the commission from the black market. They said they didn’t know who the commissioner was.”
Let’s start from there.
It’s notorious for its ironclad security. No one has ever gotten in and come out alive, but…
Well, it’s still a place where people live.
"I’ll have to check it out.”
I’ll beat the crap out of everyone there until someone tells me.
