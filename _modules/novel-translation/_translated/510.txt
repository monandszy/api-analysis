## Chapter 510: Tomb (2)
Hans A.
My first bedfellow in this world, the first being I ever killed.  Thanks to him, I evolved from a mere mortal into a civilized being within the Labyrinth, eventually leading me to encounter Erwin, and finally to this very place.  But…
“Is it because of the name ‘Hans’? You’re so tenacious, even in death.”
His portrait, of all things.
The first thing I discarded after looting, during bag organization. Is this a cursed doll that keeps coming back, no matter how many times I throw it away?
“Hmm, an item discarded in the Labyrinth, you say…?”
What?  Amelia, how did you get here?
As I regained my composure, I noticed that the other team members were also listening intently, even as they carried out their assigned tasks.  Explorers, all of them, with their keen ears. 
“…Perhaps this place is where everything lost in the Labyrinth gathers.”
Bersil quickly made a hypothesis, as if by magic, but it was a hypothesis anyone would come up with after hearing my story.
“Oh! How intriguing! So, can I find my old shoes now? They were a favorite!”
“If you’re lucky, maybe.”
“Wait a minute, Goul’d. If your theory is true, what are all these?  There shouldn’t be this many wardrobes or tables lost in the Labyrinth, should there?”
Amelia presented a point of contention, but Bersil couldn’t easily respond and trailed off.
“I wonder… why is that…?”
The contradiction in the hypothesis that this place serves as a dumping ground for the Labyrinth.
To my surprise, it was the sailor Aouyen who offered a clear explanation.
“Perhaps… they are furniture from large ships.”
“Large ships?”
“When the sixth floor was first opened, spatial magic wasn’t as developed, I heard.  So, ancient explorers couldn’t summon ships the way we do now.”
“Oh, so?”
“They gathered wood on the Starting Island and built ships directly on the sixth floor, using them right there. The story of ancient explorers utilizing ships built on the sixth floor is something every sailor learns first.”
“…How is that even possible?  They didn’t just travel to nearby islands, did they? Did they just discard the ships after use?”
“No. They used magic to solve that problem. Spatial magic may not have been as developed back then, but it wasn’t as if they didn’t use magic at all.”
Aouyen didn’t know the details of the magic, but she explained that it was a kind of magic that automatically guided the ships back to the Starting Island, regardless of where they were anchored, using ocean currents.
“They used the fact that even when the Labyrinth is closed, the sixth floor’s time still flows.”
“Yes. However, it led to many cases of theft and conflict.  Oh, and of course, ships frequently wrecked on the way back to the Starting Island.”
“I see. Thank you for the information.”
I apologize to Aouyen, who was eager to share, but I had to cut her off.
Explanations are fine, but she should focus on sailing.
“Just keep a firm hold on the wheel, okay?”
“Ah, yes!”
“Erwin, stop staring at that.”
“…!”
“Einar, is your mopping finished?”
I quickly returned the distracted members to their original duties. 
It doesn’t really matter if a wardrobe or a chair floats on the sea, does it?
There’s only one thing that matters.
We can find items lost in the Labyrinth here.
“Bersil, keep retrieving anything floating.  There might be treasure mixed in.”
“Yes, I understand.”
Right now, Hans A’s family portrait is useless, but who knows what the future holds?
A Number item, a high-tier material equipment…
There are countless lost treasures from a long history.
Just like how we had to discard so much equipment in the Ice Rock canyon and return empty-handed.
‘Hmm, thinking about it this way, it’s not a dumping ground, is it? More like a tomb, filled with precious grave goods.’
I understand now.
I wondered why there were so many people waiting in front of the tombstone, even while Berzak was summoned.
That’s what they were risking their lives for.
‘New monster essence, byproducts, and floating treasures…'
How much will I get when I go back to the city and settle up? As I was thinking that, Erwin on the observation deck shouted at the top of her lungs.
“Old man! It’s an island! An island has appeared!”
…Is it another Rank 1 monster? 
***
To cut to the chase, what Erwin found was indeed an island.
Well, maybe it’s a bit ambiguous to call it an island?
Whatever it is, it’s definitely not a monster.
“…It looks like a temple.”
A single building made of two pillars stands proudly on the water.
We sailed around the island, but there was only one entrance, on the front side. Unfortunately, the interior was shrouded in the Labyrinth’s shadows, making it impossible to see.
In other words, we have to go inside…
“What should we do?”
“What do you mean ‘what should we do’? We came here to explore, so we’re going to explore.”
Since the surrounding water was shallow, we all transferred to small auxiliary vessels and de-summoned the main ship.
Then, we slowly rowed towards the island.
“…A strange space.”
As we disembarked from the small boat and approached the entrance, the interior, previously hidden in shadow, started to become visible.
‘Visibility is about 5 meters.’
The first thing we saw was a vast staircase leading down.
The height and width seemed designed for something enormous, not a human being.
Of course, it was convenient for me.
「The character has used [Gigantification].」
A staircase I can walk normally on, even while [Gigantification] is active?
This is truly a treasure.
Kuung, kuung, kuung-
I took the lead, determined to take the brunt of any potential attacks, and descended the stairs.
How long had it been?
“It’s incredibly deep.”
I’ve descended at least 200 steps.
What is this place?
It feels like a spatial anomaly, but I decided to ignore it.  In this world, considering reality is meaningless.
Kuung-!
As I kept descending, the stairs finally ended.
“Ugh, the smell of dust.”
A space with a musty odor.
Visibility was low, so I couldn’t check the details, but it soon began to get brighter.
“…!”
The space brightened up as if someone flipped a switch.
The whole team flinched at the change, momentarily searching for an enemy, but soon everyone stared blankly around.
“This is……”
A ceiling as high as the depth we descended.
And giant bookshelves reaching up to that ceiling.
“What is it…?  It looks like a library.”
The first association was a library, but it was vastly different from an ordinary one.
The size.
Each book was so large I needed to spread both my arms wide to hold it. The bookshelves with thousands of books stacked upon them were even larger.
“Oh! Not as heavy as I thought?”
Even so, the weight of the books was manageable for an explorer’s strength.
“Mr. Pnellin, could you open a book?”
“Ah, of course!”
Einar soon pulled a book from the bookshelf, placed it on the floor, and opened it.
However…
“It’s empty… .”
What?  Are these books just props?
“Bersil, you stay here and investigate the books.  Einar, you help Bersil. If anything dangerous happens, make sure to protect him.”
I left Einar and Bersil by the bookshelf and went to investigate the area further.
A cylindrical space.
A custom-made curved bookshelf lined the perimeter, reaching all the way to the ceiling.
And…
“…I don’t know what its purpose is.”
A stone slab in the center, shaped like a table.
And a large stone gate located across from the stairs we came down, behind the bookshelves.
I examined it carefully, but found nothing worth noting.
‘It seems like a place where this is used to do something… .’
Since there seemed to be no monsters or traps, I had everyone split up and investigate, and soon there was news.
“Mr. Yan’d, I found a book with writing on it!  It’s in an ancient language, so you need to see it.”
Whew, studying the ancient language has come in handy.
I hurried over to where Bersil was, and saw a book spread out on the floor.
A picture on one side, and writing on the other.
“The picture seems to be of a Rank 9 beast, like the Wallduder…  but I can’t read the text at all.”
As Bersil guessed, the picture was indeed of a Wallduder.
Because it was written next to it in text.
The name.
Habitat.
Ability.
And details like the origin of its name, characteristics of its ability, and its individual habits, etc.
“…It’s like a field guide.  Is this the only one you found?”
“Yes.  No matter how many times I turn the pages, all the other pages are blank.”
“I see… .”
“Your tone seems a bit strange.”
“I just have something to think about.”
This book alone is already incredibly valuable.
Raven, who’s a history buff, would probably be jumping up and down, calling it a great discovery, and so on.
But I’m not interested in that kind of thing.
An explorer, not a mage, focuses more on things other than knowledge.
‘How can I use this?’
What can I do with this discovery?
No, even more importantly, why does this exist here?
Rather than research, trying everything and finding results is the explorer’s way of exploration.
“Everyone, gather.”
For that reason, I immediately summoned my companions.
“Did you figure something out?”
“Not exactly, but I think there’s something worth trying.”
“Worth trying?”
Amelia tilted her head, but this is something better seen than heard.
Especially since I’m not even sure if it’ll work.
Tok.
I placed the book Bersil found on the stone slab in the center.
Then, about 3 seconds passed.
“…You do make mistakes sometimes.”
Just as Amelia opened her mouth in the silence.
Swaaa-aaa-!
The stone slab began to emit a blue light.
A sign that something has changed.
And in [Dungeon & Stone], this means a dangerous situation.
Therefore…
“Bjorn! Look, over there! The stone gate is opening…!”
I ran towards the direction Misha pointed and stood at the front, urgently shouting.
“Combat Ready!”
My companions, prepared with battle cries, crouched low.
Time passes in heavy anticipation.
1 second, 2 seconds, 3 seconds…
When 4 seconds had passed, a monster meekly appeared in the gap of the slightly opened gate.
[Chirp—]
…It was a Wallduder.
[Chirp-chirp!]
Only one.
***
The floor where the first monster we encountered after the exploration was Rank 1.
So, everyone, including me, was wary of what might come out of that stone gate.
But…
“Wallduder…?”
Only a single Rank 9 monster.
“Don’t let your guard down.  Something else might come out.”
As the leader, I said that, but I felt my own spirits sink.
But that feeling didn’t take long to turn into understanding.
‘…I understand how it works.’
When I placed the ‘Wallduder’ from the book on the stone slab, a ‘Wallduder’ appeared from the gate.
Is this a coincidence?
“Erwin.”
As soon as I called her name, Erwin shot an arrow.
Is this telepathy?  Does she understand what I’m trying to do just by hearing my name now?
I don’t know, but it doesn’t matter right now.
[…! ]
The Wallduder, which had been scurrying towards us, died before it could even chirp.
Swaaa-aaa-!
A scattering of light and a Rank 9 magic stone fell to the ground.
Since the Beginner’s Luck buff didn’t activate, no essence dropped.
I would have thrown it away anyway.
Drrrd-drrrd-drrrd-drrrd!
The stone gate closed immediately after the beast was killed.
And…
“Hey, Mr. Yan’d! Over here!”
A staircase leading to the second shelf of the giant bookshelf appeared.
A rather intuitive progression for [Dungeon & Stone].
‘Keep summoning and go up, huh.’
But before going up, I checked the book I’d placed on the stone slab again.
“The picture and the text are both gone… .”
Meaning a book that has been used can’t be reused.
So, I tossed the blank book to the floor and climbed the stairs.
Then, I suddenly had a thought.
‘Can’t I just climb up without using the stairs and take the books?’
If I thought it, I did it. That’s the Barbarian spirit.
I used my height to climb onto the railing of the third bookshelf, which wasn’t yet connected, and climbed even higher.
However, the books on the bookshelf wouldn’t budge, no matter how hard I pushed.
‘I can climb up, but can’t take the books.’
What happens if I just climb to the top?
I was suddenly curious, but I decided to check that later, if the progression was blocked or if I had time.
There’s still a lot to do here.
“Everyone, find books with pictures in them.”
My instructions were given, and the whole team searched the bookshelves, flipping through the books.  With everyone working together, it didn’t take more than a few minutes to find something.
This time, it was a book with pictures of two monsters.
One was the Nightflyer, a Rank 8 beast.
“Oh! I know this guy!  The vampire I met in the Blood Citadel had an ability similar to this one.”
The other was the Macgurie, a beast we’d encountered countless times before.
“…How is it? What does it say?”
“It already has an official name, so we wasted our time.”
Since it was the first monster we encountered, everyone was curious about what was written about the Macgurie…
‘Let’s see, the name is… .’
As soon as I read the letters at the top, I froze.
“…What? Bjorn, why are you suddenly like that?”
Einar approached me, worried.
Bersil, who was nearby, asked the same question.
“…Mr. Yan’d?  Is something wrong?”
I didn’t answer. 
“Macgurie.”
“Yes?”
“It says the name in this book is also Macgurie.”
“…Yes?  What does that mean?  Surely, that name was given by the Captain… .”
So, it’s weird, is it?
“Wh, what a coincidence… !  The name is the same… .”
As I stared at the book, Aouyen muttered in a dumbfounded tone.
It’s not an incomprehensible perspective.
It definitely makes more sense to think that way.
But…
The name.
Habitat.
Ability.
I continued reading past those explanations and reached the section on the origin of the name, and I couldn’t help but stop.
[………The Under-1st Floor, Record Vault.  This name was given by Bjorn Yan’d, the explorer who first entered the Record Vault, after he discovered it.]
No, what is this, again?
