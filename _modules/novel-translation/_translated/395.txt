## Chapter 395: Captain Barbarian (5)
My head pounded. My stomach churned, my lips felt parched, and my throat was dry as dust. But the discomfort was secondary to the question that consumed me. 
“Why am I here?”
James Calla, Vice-Captain of the Geartooth, gasped for air like someone who'd been deprived of breath, his eyes snapping open. 
“Ugh…!”
The first thing he saw was an unfamiliar ceiling. It was crafted from rich wood, adorned with intricate carvings, and a dazzling chandelier hung suspended above. With his mind still foggy, he tried to piece together his surroundings. 
A man's face appeared before him. 
“You're awake.”
It was Jun, a paladin of the Tobera Church. The first time they met, James had thought, 'How can a paladin be this handsome…?'
“Ah…!”
James, recalling his last memory before blacking out, jolted upright. Fortunately, he’d managed to dodge just in time, narrowly avoiding a collision with the paladin. He hurriedly asked, 
“The fight… how did the fight end?”
The paladin awkwardly lifted a corner of his lips. 
“You already know, don’t you?”
“So, I was right…?”
“Yes, we lost. He’s truly formidable, that man.”
The paladin’s tone, devoid of even a hint of disappointment, contrasted sharply with James’ own despondency. 
“Calla, are you having trouble accepting defeat?”
“That’s not it… I just… I don’t know what to say to the Alminus Trading Company or the Explorers Guild. They put their faith in me.”
“Just be honest,” said the paladin. 
“We went in with four of us and lost, leaving ourselves at the mercy of some barbaric savage? How can I… No, why are you laughing?”
“My apologies. The word ‘barbaric’ is just so striking.”
James conceded his mistake. He realized how his words could have sounded. 
It might have appeared like he was gossiping, trying to belittle him. Like the repulsive creatures he’d encountered countless times since becoming Vice-Captain.
“Calla, do you still find it difficult to accept him?”
“That’s… not true.”
James replied in a solemn tone, his voice heavy with a sense of defeat. 
“I’ve come to accept him.”
His words were sincere, not a facade. The initial shock of that first encounter had been overwhelming, leading to his rash judgment. 
“He’s… a cunning man.”
The paladin nodded in agreement without hesitation. 
“Yes, he is.”
“Looking back, we were playing right into his hands from the start. We underestimated him. We thought he was a simpleton, but he was anything but.”
“True. I must confess, even I never thought we’d lose, right until the end. I’m clearly not a very skilled swordsman.”
James couldn’t have agreed more.  If they’d only taken the rumors of “the Blood Spirit’s Man” seriously, instead of dismissing them with a laugh, they might have avoided this situation. 
“I’m just worried about how the others will react. Ah, where are Knight Kaislan and Senior Akuraba?”
“They’re in other rooms. Earlier, they were unconscious, but I’m not sure about their current state. Unlike you, they suffered more severe injuries.”
“I should go see them.”
The two parted ways, each heading to their own private rooms.  Both had been healed by the temple priests, leaving them to recover from their unconsciousness. 
He sat by Akuraba’s side, waiting. It wasn’t long before she opened her eyes. 
“From the look on your face, I take it we lost?”
Unlike James, she didn’t ask a long, drawn-out question. With her gaze clouding over, she simply remained silent for a while before inquiring about the others. 
“Akuraba, you’re awake. Are you in any pain?”
“I’m fine, thank you. But… where is he?”
“I’m not sure. Perhaps he’s waiting for us to all wake up and gather ourselves before he makes his appearance.”
“As if he’s that considerate.”
Akuraba’s lighthearted comment eased the tense atmosphere.  While they were catching up, Kaislan regained consciousness. 
“That man! What happened to him?!”
It was time to discuss the situation. 
***
“We lost…,” he mumbled, his voice laced with remorse and an inexplicable rage. 
Knight Kaislan clenched his fist tightly. 
“I cannot accept this.”
“The fact that we lost?”
“I’m not that foolish to deny it. However, our defeat and that brute’s rise to leadership are two separate matters.”
“Goodness, are you going to go back on a promise that’s been officially acknowledged in front of the Duke?”
Kaislan flinched slightly at the mention of the Duke but remained resolute. 
“Would you readily agree to that? Thirty people! Not just any thirty, but the city’s finest, those who will carry its future! Do we truly entrust their lives to someone who only has strength? For the sake of the greater good, I cannot stand by and let this happen!”
James winced at the knight’s harsh outburst. He hadn’t realized the man was this unreasonable. 
“Knight Kaislan, are you claiming that you and everyone else are superior to him in all other aspects, except for strength?”
“It’s not just about me, it’s all of us. We are all better than that unknown brute, aren’t we?”
“I see. So, why don’t you tell us where you feel you excel compared to him?”
“I don’t understand why you’re looking at me like that. Didn’t we all have a deep discussion earlier about the qualities of an ideal leader? Except for him, not a single person mentioned strength.”
“We did.”
“Didn’t you all know? That a leader’s strength is the least important quality.”
James couldn’t deny the knight’s words. A leader needs a sharp blade, but they don’t need to be the blade themselves. 
However….
“The Duke’s word is final, and we can’t undo the outcome. I’d rather draw a line in the sand now.”
James finished his political calculations and spoke up. 
“I don’t believe he lacks any qualities compared to us.”
“What…?”
“I’m not proud to admit it as the one who lost, but he wasn’t significantly stronger than the four of us.”
James truly believed that.  If they’d had time to practice together, and had truly fought with all their hearts, the victor would have been different. 
But….
“That’s irrelevant now.”
“We lost in a single match, and he won. Do you know why that happened?”
The knight only glared at him, remaining silent.  
James continued without waiting any longer. 
“We lacked information. I realized it during the fight. He already knew so much about us.  What essences we had, what equipment we used.”
“So, are you saying that he’s the ideal leader you mentioned? Get a hold of yourself! He’s just received information from the Duke!”
“Isn’t that the scariest part?  We had no idea who was coming to this city until we arrived, but the Duke was different.”
Kaislan didn’t respond to James’ words. 
“Yes, I understand what you’re saying. You are simply accepting that man as our superior. Do the rest of you agree?”
Kaislan’s gaze shifted to the ninth-floor explorer, Titana Akuraba. 
But….
“Even if you see it that way, my opinion isn’t much different.”
There was no support as Kaislan expected. 
“Why? Are you afraid of the Duke?”
“I won’t deny it. But there’s something else that weighs more heavily.”
“What else?”
“I don’t think that man is necessarily worse than any of us.”
Kaislan narrowed his eyes, seemingly unable to comprehend. 
Akuraba shrugged, her voice a mix of amusement and melancholy. 
“What impressed me the most wasn’t his connections, but his inherent meticulousness.”
“Meticulousness…?”
Kaislan exhaled, as if he’d heard something abhorrent.
“Yes. His meticulousness. Remember at the banquet?  He knew about us, but he acted as if he didn’t, even putting on a facade of arrogance to lure us into his trap.”
And that wasn’t all. 
The same pattern was evident during the battle. He held back his various essence-based abilities until the most opportune moment to maximize their effectiveness. A prime example was James Calla, who was quickly defeated.  This left the remaining three of them burdened with even more pressure. 
“And I don’t know if it’s just his intuition, but his combat instincts were beyond awe-inspiring.”
“He’s a natural.”
He was like a fire, burning himself down. Yet, when we woke up, we found that we too had been consumed by his flames.
He smirked in satisfaction. 
“I thought he was fighting on instinct, but now I realize he was making logical decisions and judgments.”
“It’s quite remarkable if that’s true.  Giving up one eye to smash Knight Kaislan with his hammer, that was a calculated move.”
“The fall of our formation began right then.  From his perspective, it was a clear gain.”
As James Calla and the paladin exchanged praise, Kaislan clenched his jaw. He couldn’t grasp it. 
‘What’s wrong with these people?’
They should know how important the expedition leader’s position is, yet they act like this.  He couldn’t help but suspect that they’d struck some sort of secret deal with the Duke while they were unconscious.  
Despite his internal turmoil, the conversation continued. 
“The truth is… what I admire most is his resolve to achieve his goal.”
Resolve?
Kaislan scoffed, but the paladin continued without noticing. 
“As Calla said, he wasn’t significantly stronger than the four of us. Yet, he engaged us with an arrogance bordering on audacity.”
His bones had shattered, his organs were burned, and he’d been blinded in one eye. 
But he never fell. 
When firewalls were erected, he pushed through, burning his skin. He coughed up blood, forced from his own bitten tongue. Even when his scapula collapsed, his shoulder dangling, he swung his hammer.
“Is there anyone among us who could have endured that level of pain and kept fighting?”
“…”
“Shamefully, I’ve never seen anyone fight with such unwavering determination, even when pushed to their limits.”
That man, surely he didn’t enjoy the process. The pain must have been unbearable.  
Even if he’d given up, everyone would have understood.  He’d reached the end of his endurance. 
“Most people, when they’re in such a state, would crack.  They’d tell themselves, ‘this is enough, I’ve done enough.’ They’d search for a compromise and invent excuses to convince themselves.”
But he didn’t. 
How was that even possible?
The paladin, a servant of the divine, attributed his strength to faith. 
“It’s faith.  Faith that he wouldn’t fall. Because he believed in himself so strongly, he didn’t break.  He overcame his trials and achieved victory.”
“So, you, paladin Jun, also agree that he should be our leader?”
The paladin’s response held no hint of sarcasm. 
“Yes. If I have to follow someone, I’d trust his back more than anyone else’s.”
“…”
“Because, even when everyone else falls, he will remain firm.”
The paladin was clearly smitten with that man.
James Calla was concerned about the Duke, and Akuraba’s pride wouldn’t allow her to break a promise. 
“Just admit it. We lost. We were unconscious. We lost. And he didn’t even complain when one of us woke up and rejoined the battle. Sure, we were in the heat of the moment then, but it’s tantamount to foul play.”
“He stayed silent because he knew we wouldn’t accept anything less.”
With three votes in favor, Kaislan was powerless to do anything.
‘Thank goodness.  If he’d refused the outcome and demanded a rematch with the Duke, the Duke’s personality wouldn’t have allowed it. I’d have been caught in the crossfire.’
James Calla let out a sigh of relief, watching Kaislan clench his jaw in defeat. 
But there were still some lingering anxieties.
“Very well. I won’t say anything more. But all of you, remember this.  A strong unit is built on strong rules and strong control.  I doubt that man possesses that level of leadership.”
His stubborn insistence on not acknowledging the opponent.  Clearly, given the slightest opportunity, he’d stage a coup. 
If this was happening within the maze, it could have escalated into a major crisis. 
But then…
Knock knock.
A knock came from the door. 
“Ah, you’re all awake, I see.”
As the door swung open without permission, a man entered the room.
James Calla’s last lingering anxieties vanished. 
“I’m your subordinate now, so you can speak casually.”
The man, who’d never used honorifics, spoke as if it was the most natural thing in the world. He fixed his gaze on a spot and tilted his head. 
“What’s with the eye roll, knight? Did you hit your head earlier?”
It was truly remarkable. 
He couldn’t say exactly when it happened, but… 
The knight, who’d been shouting about the importance of leadership with veins bulging in his neck… 
“Answer me, I’m asking if you’re hurt.”
Was now staring at the floor, as if it was the most natural thing in the world.
