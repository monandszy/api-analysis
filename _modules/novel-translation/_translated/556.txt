## First Clear (1)
Bellarios. A third-tier monster with a specialized skill that enhanced its resistance to magic damage, my sole weakness. This essence possessed the following base stats:
* Magic Resistance +200.
* This level of magic resistance was unmatched by any other monster.
* All Attribute Sensitivity +30.
* Amplified effectiveness for skills of any attribute, such as water, fire, wind, and earth.
"That's it," I muttered, "those are the only stats." 
If it had any more, the balance would be totally off.
"Hmm," I sighed. I always thought it would have been better if it had resistance instead of sensitivity.  Of course, sensitivity is incredibly valuable and a crucial stat in this game, but...
It wouldn't matter if I were playing a Fire Barbarian or an Earth Barbarian. 
Sadly, a Shield Barbarian rarely uses them.
"The only thing I'll be using this for right now is Storm Rush," I mused. 
The wind attribute [Eye of the Storm] and the water attribute [Origin], both skills were affected by sensitivity, increasing their power.  It wouldn't matter much since they were skills I planned to eventually discard.
"The real focus is the skills themselves." 
It was a shame that stats didn't have sub-stats or resistance values, but the skills were worth more. Stats could be increased later.
(P) Cycle of the Ring — If a monster of third-tier or higher dies within a certain radius, there's a chance stats will increase.
A passive skill that boosted stats. In a way, it resembled the Manticore's [Heritage], which increased stats when consuming essence, but there was a crucial difference. 
[Cycle of the Ring] had no limit. 
Of course, the activation rate decreased as the total stats increased, practically becoming negligible after exceeding 400. But still.
(A) Greed Scale — Additional bonuses are applied based on magic resistance.
Ultimately, the heart of this essence was its active skill.
"35 from the Deep Sea Giant, 20 from Bayon, 80 from the Ogre, and 200 from Bellarios," I recited, tallying my gains. 
I got 40 from erasing [Heritage], and 8 from potions collected while grinding rifts...
"383 total."
But that wasn't all. Adding 30% to 383 from the Earth Dragon's Blessing...
"497.9."
Unfortunately, it was a little short of 500.
But this was where [Giant Size] proved to be a core skill. After all, the Earth Dragon's Blessing didn't even exist in the Shield Barbarian build.
"The character activated [Giant Size]."
"The character's physique increased, boosting threat and physical stats proportionally."
I didn't even bother with the [Transcendent] Giant Size, and while I didn't further amplify stats with [Savage Burst], it was more than enough to exceed 500.
"The character activated [Greed Scale]."
Immediately after activating the skill, blue scales sprouted on the Barbarian's characteristic thick skin.
"Whoa! Bjorn is evolving into a Lizardman!"
Lizardman, you say? How disappointing.
I smirked down at my transformed physique.
"The character's magic resistance exceeds 500."
"All magic damage received is reduced by 50%."
"Physical resistance increases proportionally to absorbed magic damage."
Finally, the Barbarian Dragon Mode was mine. 
***
I was lost in the thrill of consuming the essence and using the skill, but...
"Congratulations on your achievement, Baron. But for now, I'd like you to resume your duty," Jerome said, cutting through the joy.
I had to return to the hunting grounds.  Oh, how typical of him to only care about his duties.
While it was annoying, it wasn't a bad thing considering efficiency.
"You've slain a Bantao."
"You've slain an Elder Wyvern."
"You've slain a Fletwinder..."
The higher the tier of the monster, the more rewarding it was to kill.
Shooosh-!
After slaying about seven monsters, a heavenly ring formed above my head, drawing in the light emitted from the slain corpses as they vanished.  It was the effect of [Cycle of the Ring] activating. 
I wasn't particularly surprised since I had witnessed it in action several times with Auyen. 
"Magic Resistance permanently increased by +1."
"Natural Regeneration permanently increased by +1."
Without the system message, I had no clue what was increased.  I would have to visit the Mage Tower periodically to check my stats from now on.  It was likely to be a physical stat though.
"It was close this time, but from now on, let's stick closer to the kills," I said to myself.
[Cycle of the Ring] had an activation mechanism. 
If the slain monster was within a radius of 1 meter, the chance of increasing physical stats greatly increased.  For a radius of 5 meters, it was completely random.  
It was found that if the monster was 10 meters or farther, the activation probability was adjusted based on the stats related to special abilities.
Of course, I was the one who conducted the research.
"Temporary hold! The 3rd and temporary 4th divisions will exchange duties with the 1st and 2nd divisions!"
How much time had passed? 
A short while later, the command center ordered a rotation. The knights, who were gossiping, all had bright smiles, but I was the exception.
"Ah, I just wanted to keep stacking stats here," I sighed.  When else would I be able to slay so many third-tier monsters?  I wanted to make the most of it while exploring with the expedition force. 
But…
"Baron, you may not know this, but you have no experience leading an army. However, rules are rules and must be followed," Commander Jerome asserted, cutting off my request.
"If one precedent is set, someone will inevitably try to exploit it," I mused.  There was no point in arguing further, so I had to quell my disappointment and turn back.
Pff, whoosh-!
Leaving the front lines of the dungeon, I began retrieving books from towering bookshelves.  As I did, I could see the battle unfolding below with newfound clarity.
Whoooosh-!
The knights unleashed their colorful auras, slashing at the enemies with reckless abandon, fueled by the constant stream of wide-area heals provided by the priests.
And then, it happened.
"Ihiliaat Bendae Tiulron!"
Dozens of mages unleashed a combined spell, showering the battlefield with their might.
This was the reason I secured this essence so early, even going against my plan to preserve the fountain pen for as long as possible.  
I had to prepare for the worst.
"There are just too many mages," I muttered to myself. If they turned against me, I wouldn't be able to respond properly in my current state.
"If it comes to it... I can at least put up a fight," I thought.  
I needed to give Amelia an essence, but I was hesitant to use the last fountain pen.  Maybe one would show up if I just waited?
"Uncle, what are you thinking so hard about?"
"Why are you always so curious about my thoughts?"
"Haha… I don't know? Why…?"
"Don't be silly."
Lost in my thoughts, I continued retrieving books from the towering shelves. The shift change came soon, and by the time the second change occurred, the day had ended. 
And how many days did this routine repeat itself? 
The 114th day of entering the dungeon.
4 PM.  
Only eight hours left until the next rain season.
"Commander, we've reached the final bookshelf."
The end of the library exploration was near. 
***
Honestly, I was a little surprised. 
I never thought it would be possible to reach the library's end-game content in just a week.  
It was a speed unmatched by us, who had been grinding for over a month and only managed to reach the third and second tiers.
But I did have a reason to defend our slower progress. 
For them, their goal was conquest, not hunting.  
They only summoned one book per floor, carefully selecting them to maximize progress, unlike us who had been trying to slay as many third-tier monsters as possible.  
And the result?
"Until further notice, all troops are to rest and standby at their leisure!"
For the first time, the royal army, which had never stopped summoning books late into the night, gave their troops a break.
Of course, the higher-ups were exempt.
"Then, we shall commence the meeting now."
While everyone was lounging around recovering HP and MP, we, the higher-ups, gathered in one place for the meeting.
Everyone wore a somber expression.  
I knew about the first-tier monster in the last book, thanks to Hamshik, but…
They didn't.
"We've confirmed, as expected, a first-tier monster residing in the final bookshelf."
The voice of the deputy commander, who presided over the meeting, trembled slightly as his voice hardened.
Of course, that didn't change what needed to be done. 
"Let me preface this by saying that Commander has decided to proceed with the mission, even if the opponent is a first-tier monster."
It was an expected statement, but the expedition force's commanders were momentarily shaken by it.
"A first-tier monster... We'll certainly suffer severe losses."
"I question if it's worth that kind of risk."
I understood their feelings.  
We had suffered casualties on our way here. 
"Commander, seven members have perished already!"
Seven soldiers had died in battle.  Six of them were knights from the expedition force, and one was a warrior from the Armin exploration team. 
No matter how many priests we had, there was nothing we could do about a one-hit kill.
"These days, losing a limb is nothing special," I mused.  Even in the previous summoning book, there were two second-tier and four third-tier monsters.  We had even transitioned from dividing into groups to full-force combat. 
Despite that, over twenty limbs were lost in that battle.  They were reattached by priests after the battle, but still. 
What would happen if we encountered a first-tier monster in this state?
"If we suffer more casualties here, it won't just be a loss for our team, it—"
A knight spoke his concerns, but Commander Jerome immediately cut him off. 
"Enough." 
"..."
"This is a mission entrusted to us by the Holy Royal Family.  Therefore, we must fulfill our duty. Even if it means sacrificing ourselves in the process."
As befitting an army that followed strict rules of command, the knight who had expressed his anxieties clamped his mouth shut after Jerome's firm words.
The deputy commander, eyeing everyone, continued the meeting.
"The discussion on whether to proceed with the mission is not on today's agenda." 
Jerome had already decided to fight, so the only reason he had gathered all the commanders was this.
"Please feel free to voice your opinions on which of the seven confirmed monsters we should summon.  Which summoning would be most effective."
Which one would be most reasonable to summon?
As the meeting began, various opinions emerged, and I quietly listened, evaluating each one.
"I believe Leviathan is the best choice. This place isn't the sea, is it? As a monster who greatly benefited from geographical advantages, its difficulty level should be relatively low."
Leviathan was the wrong choice.  
While the logic was sound, this team wouldn't be able to kill it.
"What about Tol-Lapupa? It's a monster specialized in defense.  If we invest enough time, it's the most viable option for achieving minimal casualties."
So that was out of the question as well. 
The knights were numerous, but the expedition force's core damage dealers were the mages. 
With this team, we could never break through its shell.
"I believe summoning Kashan is the right course—"
"I don't know.  I think Ridger is a much better opponent than Kashan—"
The commanders continued to share their opinions, debating and agreeing with each other. 
Of course, it all sounded ridiculous to me.
We only knew about first-tier monsters through stories.  
It was practically a legendary creature, rarely encountered in real battles. 
Because of that, the arguments they presented as evidence were lacking in realism.
"So, I'm the one who has to step up?" I thought. 
Even though it was a game, I've slayed countless first-tier monsters.  
This meeting seemed pointless to me.  
It was already obvious that they were only focused on minimizing casualties. 
No one was considering failure.  
They truly believed that they could defeat any of the seven monsters...
"Baron, you've been awfully quiet."
"...Me?"
"Is there any opinion you'd like to share?"
Oh, that.  
I'd been thinking about when I'd bring it up, but they've already laid the groundwork.
"There is." 
The commanders showed keen interest and focused their attention on me.
"If we summon one, it has to be Kashan."
My blunt statement made their eyes gleam.
"You mean the prophetic wolf?"
"Indeed, Baron, we share the same opinion."
Some were taken aback, while others were satisfied that our opinions aligned.
And...
"If you don't mind my asking, could you explain why it should be Kashan?"
The top mage of the expedition force looked down on me with a condescending expression.
As if he were looking at a mindless barbarian.
"He's on the 'summon Leviathan' side, I see," I thought. 
The mage, acting as if he was enlightened, lectured me.
"Kashan is the most aggressive monster of those mentioned earlier. That means our expedition force will surely suffer heavy losses."
Oh, so because he's good with magic and books, he acts like he's got it all figured out.
"However, if there's a reason why we must choose Kashan over other monsters, then tell me.  If you cannot convince everyone... "
"There is a reason."
"...Huh?" 
This old man acts so surprised because I said there is a reason when he was the one who asked. 
I quickly continued speaking.
"Tol-Lapupa, Leviathan, none of them matter. We have no choice."
Meaning, the others are impossible to beat.
