## The Reconstruction (5) 
The Royal Council meeting.
It was a gathering of the city's most prominent nobles and military figures equivalent to generals in modern times. This council was where policies to guide the kingdom were formulated. It was essentially the core of the noble's power. Naturally, gaining entry was immensely difficult. This was why Countess Ragna Peprock had attracted so much attention within the noble circles. It was unprecedented for a noble family without established roots to secure a seat on the Royal Council so quickly. Of course, it was rumored that the Chancellor was behind her.
Anyway. 
"I couldn't believe there were no representatives from Melbes at the Royal Council meeting."
Frankly, I expected Melbes, with its thirty-two noble families, to hold at least one seat. I couldn't imagine it being otherwise. Maybe this too was a subtle form of discrimination against non-humans. Well, it was a good thing for me, of course.
"..."
"..."
The council room fell silent in response to my question about needing a drink. As everyone seemed uncertain how to react, a noble from the corner spoke up.
"Hey, could you tell someone to bring us some tea? Make it cold with lots of ice."
A statement and action imbued with the recognition of his own inferior status. With that, the situation was effectively resolved. After all, it was the Chairman who had spoken.
"Yes? Ah, yes… Chairman."
One of the Barons beside the Chairman exited the council room and returned with a freshly ordered drink. Then…
"Place it over there."
The servant, seemingly having been grilled by the Chairman, placed a glass of iced tea before me in the blink of an eye. It was the iced tea of this era. Though it was quite different from the sugary kind I used to enjoy at PC bangs.
"Not bad."
As I savored the aroma and coolness with a large gulp, the Chairman addressed me.
"Now then, will you tell us?"
"Well… I'm not sure where to begin."
"Then let's start with this. Baron, it is true that you have been granted the right to attend the Royal Council?"
"It's true. I was resting at the Sanctuary when this letter arrived a while back."
I retrieved the letter I had kept in my possession and showed it to the others. Their expressions shifted once more. Of course, none of them believed I was trying to show off…
"It's real…"
"It has the Royal Seal."
"Looking at the position… it's still a minor seat, but…"
Even so, seeing the evidence with their own eyes made a difference.
"So, is that all you want to ask?"
I rephrased his question in a more Barbarian manner, urging him to ask what he wanted to know. The Chairman hesitated for a long time before cautiously opening his mouth.
"Perhaps… you have made a pact with the Royal Family?"
"That's a strange question. What pact could there be? We are all the Royal Family's subjects."
It was a lie, a complete fabrication. But if they asked like that, I couldn't say anything else. The Chairman quickly realized his mistake and corrected his question.
"…Then I'll ask again. I know this is a rude question… "
"Go ahead. It's fine."
"Have you made any promises with the Royal Family since your return to the city?"
Even a Barbarian like me could understand the Chairman's concern behind this question. He was worried about losing talent.  He must have been anxious that I would abandon Melbes and become a close confidant of the Royal Family, the main stream of power. I didn't know he'd openly express his anxiety in front of everyone.
"…Why did you think that?"
"It was like that even after you joined the meeting today. When I offered to pay you a commission for access to the information about the Underground Floor, you just postponed it."
Ah, that…
"They must have thought that way."
I had no intention of leaving Melbes for a new nest. I liked this group’s nature. And the fact that they were a collective of ostracized non-humans was a huge advantage for me. However, I had kept my silence regarding the Underground Floor exploration because I didn't know if I would eventually strike a deal with the Royal Family. 
"You seem to have gotten the wrong idea, so I'll be clear. I have made no promises with the Royal Family."
"Then the Royal Council meeting…?"
"I don't know. It just arrived without any warning."
This was true. I had not received any prior notice or communication from the Duke before the letter arrived. Did they believe me? 
"I see…"
"Satisfied with the explanation?"
"Yes, I am. Initially, I was worried, but it seems the Royal Family also recognizes it."
"Recognizes what?"
"That you are already the backbone of the city's political landscape."
The Chairman's gaze, as he said those words, burned hotter than fire. He had an intensity I had never seen before.  He seemed determined to keep me. 
"A bit intimidating, but…" 
Honestly, this was a very positive situation. Having the other thirty-one families in Melbes supporting me from behind. That was the ultimate goal I could achieve in Melbes— 
"That's right."
However, the flame of passion in the Chairman's eyes went out as soon as he spoke those words.
"That's the end of the questions. Mariblack Baron, let's continue the discussion."
"Yes? Ah, yes… I understand."
The host took over the discussion after the Chairman’s statement, and everyone exchanged opinions cautiously, watching me and the Chairman. However, the Chairman did not address me or make eye contact with me again until the end of the meeting.
"…What? Is he playing hard to get?"
I felt a bit awkward, considering the intensity I had received from him just moments ago. But it didn't take long to realize he was trying to suppress his feelings.
"Then, I would like to express my gratitude to all the family heads for gracing us with your presence. This council meeting is now adjourned…"
Just as the meeting ended, and I was about to get up.
"Baron, could you stay for a moment?"
"..."
"The Mariblack Family's tea is truly excellent."
A noble courtesy, implying that he wanted to have a private conversation.
"Well, I will."
I agreed and waited, and the other nobles, sensing the situation, also left without any closing remarks. And then…
"Yandell Baron."
The Chairman’s gaze returned to its original state. An intense, lustful gaze that belied his age, with his greying hair.  However, while he didn't hide his emotions, his voice was calm. 
"What are your thoughts on Melbes?"
Ah, this is a probing question.
"I think it's a good place. The people are decent."
"Even after your conflict with Goldbeard Baron?"
"How can people avoid conflicts when they meet? Everyone lives like that. I don't dislike the Baron just because of that incident."
"That is a relief, then."
The Chairman had thrown the first stone, so it was my turn to throw one back.
"Chairman, what about you?"
"..."
"What do you think of Melbes?"
The Chairman looked as if he had been asked an unexpected question.
"Well, what I think of Melbes… " 
He seemed to ponder for a moment about how to answer, then replied candidly, leaving even the Barbarians present bewildered.
"I think it's a motley crew."
"….What?"
This was an outrageous statement, hard to believe coming from the Chairman of Melbes.
"Why? You're always saying we can do it. That we're stronger when we're together. Did you want to hear some positive talk?"
"It’s not like that… I just never expected such a frank answer."
"Honestly, Yandell Baron is the first person I've confided in. I can't, and shouldn't, speak like this to anyone else."
The Chairman’s face, which usually wore a kind smile, had a shade I had never seen before.  He must have been under a lot of pressure.
"So, what exactly do you mean by motley crew?"
"What else could it be?  The number of non-human noble families hasn’t increased in thousands of years, and the pureblood families are growing more powerful every day. Those who are left have no place to go, so they have banded together, but they are not truly united." 
The Chairman poured out his bottled-up feelings and words rapidly.
"Most importantly, do you know what the biggest difference between us and the other factions is?  We lack a central driving force."
"That would be what you are doing, Chairman—."
"Do you really think so, Baron?"
Well, I don’t know...
He seems respected, and all, but I don’t think thirty-one families will follow his vision like it’s their own when he lays it out.
"..."
The Chairman chuckled, seeing me remain silent.
"Even if these families unite and grow stronger, they'll remain a motley crew."
"Because we lack the central driving force you mentioned earlier?"
"That's right."
It's like corn kernels. No matter how many you have, they'll never become popcorn unless they’re heated.  I was starting to get a sense of what the Chairman wanted to say.
"Truth be told, Melbes is too small a nest to hold you, Yandell Baron."
"…I think you’re the only one who thinks that."
"Well, everyone knows it deep down, they just haven’t admitted it yet, because of their own selfish desires."
"That doesn’t explain why I don’t even have land yet."
"But you have more retainers than anyone else in this city. Yandell Baron, you are not a bird looking for a nest, you are a bird building one."
The Chairman didn’t stop praising me and continued.
"Yandell Baron, you are a tribal leader of one species, a Baron by title. You are also one of the most famous explorers in the city, and rumor has it you are a warrior whose skills rival the strongest in this world."
Well… none of that is wrong…
"Yet, you seem to undervalue yourself.  Do you think any of the other thirty-one families have what you possess?"
"Okay, enough with the flattery. Tell me what you want to say."
"I know it’s absurd to say this to a Baron who has just joined Melbes, but if I miss this opportunity, I’ll surely be waiting for years, wasting time in meaningless ways."
The Chairman looked at me with blazing eyes.
"Baron, become the focal point of Melbes."
This was sooner than expected, but it was my ultimate goal. Rather than being the tail of a dragon, I wanted to become the head of a snake and grow into a dragon. After all, I had settled in Melbes with that intention, ignoring offers from other factions.  But I needed to ask something first.
"So, Chairman, what is your aspiration? What do you want to do by building up Melbes?" 
It was a crucial question when dealing with people. What are their aspirations?
The Chairman let out a hearty laugh, his response immediate without a moment's hesitation.
"My ambition is to someday look down on those arrogant human-born nobles and say, 'If you're a weak human, then act like one.'"
"..."
"Don’t mess with us."
This old man was more radical than I thought.
***
The Chairman, having opened up about his radical and extreme tendencies, made several propositions.
"If you accept my proposal, Melbes, and our Wellbaight Baron Family, will give you our full support."
"Instead of 'full support,' I’d like to hear something more concrete."
"Not only will we entrust you with this commission, but we will also help you purchase land and build a mansion."
"And?"
"If we need to cast a vote, all thirty-one families will vote as you do. And if anything impedes your goals, we will all unite to remove it."
Oh, that’s pretty reassuring… 
"However, there is one condition."
Well, I thought this was too good to be true.
I tried to conceal my disappointment and asked about the condition. And…
"What's the condition? Tell me."
"No matter who your partner is…."
My mind went blank for a moment.
"Get married and quickly produce an heir."
…I never expected this kind of condition.
