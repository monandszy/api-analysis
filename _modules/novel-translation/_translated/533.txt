## Escape Plan (6)
My heart pounded furiously, while my head remained chillingly calm. 
“Corpses.”
Human corpses. 
Standing close behind me, the village chief pointed to the pile and spoke. 
He said these corpses were the village’s secret.
My back was slick with sweat, but I forced myself to think clearly. 
Why would he reveal this to me if he didn’t want me to see it? 
He wouldn’t expect me to disappear now that I knew his secret.
“What are these corpses?”
“You’re more composed than I expected.”
“You must have a reason for showing them to me.”
Of course, there’s always the possibility that he deliberately lured me down here to kill me.
But, my gut told me that wasn’t the case.
“Clever. As you speculated, I thought perhaps showing you this place would clear up some of your misunderstandings.”
“Misunderstandings…?”
I took a quick glance around the cellar.
The corpses were piled high, literally like a mountain.
Something was definitely amiss. 
Was it the number? Even if they had killed every explorer from the Silver Lion Clan, it couldn’t possibly be this many.
“So, who are they?”
“I don’t know.”
“…What?”
I stared at him with a look of disbelief. The village chief slowly opened his mouth.
“The truth is, you’re not the first explorers to come to this island. Others have appeared before you.”
“But why did you pretend it was your first time meeting us?”
“Ah, I need to explain that first. It wasn’t that we were pretending.”
Was he trying to play some kind of word game?
I was about to retort with a frown when the village chief continued.
“You are the first explorers to come here alive.”
“What does that mean?”
“It means exactly what it sounds like. These corpses have been in this state since the first time I saw them. Their bodies were contorted, their arms and legs twisted together. They were dead, and despite the passage of time, they never decomposed. It’s as if time froze at that moment.”
“So, are you saying they were all found during the rainy season?”
“No, that’s not true. While it’s not entirely wrong to say ‘found’, their arrival from the sky wasn’t related to the rainy season. It was just that the interval between their appearances was extremely long.”
The village chief bent down and picked up one of the corpses by the head. He looked at the half-decayed skull and said in a emotionless voice.
“Ten to fifteen years at the shortest. Thirty to forty years at the longest.  These corpses have been falling from the sky at these intervals. I suspect it’s related to dimensional collapse.”
“Dimensional collapse?”
“Yes. The intervals are roughly similar, and one of the journals I recovered from these corpses mentioned dimensional collapse.”
As he said that, the village chief pulled a notebook from his pocket and handed it to me. He explained that I only needed to read the last page.
He said the other pages were too damaged to read anyway.
I opened the notebook and read the last page.
[…………The entire world is collapsing and twisting. I understand why countless seniors described it as a disaster. This is not some mere catastrophe.]
[……Mulk is dead. Iliya is dead. Sir Swalky is dead, and Ms. Quiriane is dead. And I… I probably won’t last much longer either.]
[……No, I must return alive. I have a duty to deliver their message.]
Someone’s journal of exploration, ending with a declaration of determination.
I understood why the village chief suspected dimensional collapse. The last entry mentioning dimensional collapse was suspicious enough. 
Of course, that was that, and this was this.
“So why have you collected all these corpses in the cellar? And why have you kept it a secret from us?”
“It’s a long story.”
The village chief waved his hand, and the nearby monster warriors quickly retreated.
Seriously, why send them away? They can’t even understand human language.
I acknowledged the question without pursuing it further.
“These corpses held great significance for me. Their existence confirmed that time was flowing outside, and through the occasional records I found, I could hear about what was happening outside.”
“But?”
“I began research. I hoped to find some clue that would help me escape this dreadful place. But my hopes were dashed time and again. I tried everything I could, but these corpses were just ordinary corpses. They just didn’t age.”
After his final experiment, attempting to send these corpses into the labyrinth to let the outside world know of their existence, failed miserably, he gave up on his research.
He collected the corpses and stored them in the cellar.
He had given up, but he clung to the hope that one day he might use them again.
But…
“Then you came. For me, on the verge of giving up on everything, you were my last hope.”
“So you decided to keep the story of these corpses a secret?”
“You were already wary of me because of our monstrous appearances, and I thought showing you this would just make matters worse. I intended to tell you eventually, but I planned to do it as discreetly as possible.”
But Amelia had sneaked into this place, and she saw the truth, forcing him to finally reveal everything. 
In short, that’s the story…
“Are you satisfied with my answer?”
“I don’t know.”
The story wasn’t entirely implausible.
But I couldn’t deny that something still felt off.
His lack of surprise when I mentioned the outside world.
The fact that he knew time was flowing…
If his story was true, it would explain many of my doubts…
‘But it feels like he’s just trying to fit the pieces together.’
Every world was the same.
The best way to conceal the truth was to reveal only bits and pieces.
And the most significant question remained unanswered.
“So, you have nothing to do with the Silver Lion Clan’s disappearance?”
“No. Why would I have any reason to harm them?”
Ugh… What am I supposed to do now?
If he had just whacked me on the head, I could have whacked him back and called it a day.
The situation has become complicated.
‘Should I believe this or not?’
I pondered for a moment, but the answer came quickly.
‘There’s no way I can trust him.’
In this world, the only beings I can trust are my comrades.
So…
‘Okay, that settles it.’
The task before me became clear.
“Since we’ve been hiding things, I won’t hold you responsible for your comrade’s violation of our village laws or your ‘mistake’ that resulted from it. How does that sound?”
I smiled broadly at the village chief’s attempt to smooth things over.
No, to be precise…
“That’s a relief. I’m glad the misunderstanding is cleared up.”
“Yes, it’s a relief that the misunderstanding is cleared up… eh?”
Smiling, I swung down my hammer.
Whack-!
The intense sensation of the hammer hitting my forehead.
The gushing, viscous blood pouring out of the gaping wound.
The village chief finally showed emotion.
“………Why?”
It was too placid to be anger, and too alive to be sadness.
I looked at his fish-like eyes, filled with confusion, and answered.
There were many suspicious parts in his story.
It felt like he was stalling for time.
My gut told me that he was going to give me time, and then hit me hard in the back of the head.
I didn’t even need to provide such illogical reasons.
A single sentence was enough.
“Your eyes were bugging me.”
“…………?”
“So I hit you. Is there a problem with that?”
There’s no need for any other reason for a Barbarian.
***
Is the village chief friend or foe?
If he is a foe, what schemes is he hiding?
What’s the truth and what’s a lie?
Those questions no longer matter.
A single blow with my hammer has made the complicated story crystal clear.
The village chief and I are now at odds.
Therefore, I will kill him right here.
If I fail…
‘I’ll escape this village with my comrades.’
A situation with a clean and simple solution.
However, the village chief still seemed confused, and he asked me.
“There was no reason for you to resort to such an extreme method.”
“Oh! Is that so?”
“You care deeply about your comrades. But to endanger them like this, it’s not like you.”
I don’t know how long he’s been watching me, but that’s not something I need to hear.
So, at this point…
“Behe-laaaaaaaaaa!!!”
I roar out a battle cry and deliver a surprise attack with my hammer.
Bang-!
The village chief doesn’t panic. He draws his sword and blocks my hammer. But did he get the message? That I’m done talking.
The village chief murmurs in a cold voice.
“There are consequences for wrong choices.”
Seriously, what’s the point of saying that with a fish head? It’s not even remotely cool.
Does this guy need some mirror therapy?
I don’t know, but I stuck my mouth out like a fish and mimicked him.
“Thol-lin’ sun-tack-en chock-im-i tow-le-jee.”
His reaction came with a slight delay.
“………You’re crazy.”
Well, even if I praised him here, he wouldn’t spare me anyway.
Clench-
I grip my hammer in both hands and apply more force, pushing the village chief’s sword back.
‘He’s using both hands, but I’m pushing him back, so his strength must be lower than mine.’
Did he reach the same conclusion?
The village chief ended the standoff, shifting his sword to a slanted position and smoothly deflecting my hammer to the side.
Bang-!
My hammer crashed into the ground, conserving its mass.
At the same time, the village chief’s sword burst forth with a blinding light.
Whoosh-!
It was the same attack that took out Hyprahmant in one shot.
It looks similar to aura, but…
‘There are so many skills in the labyrinth.’
I still haven’t figured out what this skill is, but it doesn’t matter right now.
「The character has activated [Iron Fortress].」
「The effect of [Evolved Skin] increases by 1.5 times.」
That’s because…
「Resistance to sword-type weapons is increased by 75%.」
It’s just a sword anyway.
Bang-!
The sword, which had pierced Hyprahmant’s head like tofu, was blocked by my shield and bounced off.
My shield’s condition…
‘It’s got a few scratches, maybe?’
Yeah, they say there’s nothing more terrifying than imagination.
Experiencing it firsthand, it’s actually manageable.
Well, not without its problems.
Whoosh-!
His agility stat must be much higher than mine.  All of his attacks have missed except for the first one.
「The character has activated [Eye of the Storm].」
[Eye of the Storm] is particularly effective in tight spaces, but his damage reduction is still only 30%.
Whack-!
Even when I hit him, it doesn’t do much damage.
‘His resistance seems low… but his regeneration is pretty good.’
The wound from my initial attack, the one that did the most damage, has already healed completely.
I quickly reassessed the situation.
‘I can’t take him down in a one-on-one battle.’
I’m giving up on taking down the village chief alone.
Therefore, the next thing I need to do is this.
“Village chief, do you happen to know the two ways to make people angry?”
First, I’ll distract him with a nonsensical question.
“………?”
When he questions my words…
Clang-!
I toss a Molotov cocktail I pulled out of my dimensional bag onto the pile of corpses and break it.
And…
Whoosh-
Leaving the flames behind…
Stomp.
I sprint towards the stairs with all my might.
“Behe-laaaaaaaaaa!!!”
The stairs are devoid of monster warriors, probably because the soundproofing is pretty good. I smash the ceiling with my hammer as I ascend the stairs, so the village chief can’t follow me easily.
Thump, thump, thump, thump-!
It seems I have no talent for architecture.  The cellar begins to collapse like dominoes as I make a few cracks.
Boom-!
I ignore the relentless barrage of falling rocks and climb the stairs, taking them to my head and shoulders.
And after about 30 seconds…
Bang-!
I finally broke through the floor door and emerged outside. My comrades and the monster warriors are facing each other in the living room, waiting for me.
“Something must have happened! We should hurry down—.”
[We need to check if the village chief is okay—.]
Both groups see me and stare with open mouths.
Bersil is the only one to maintain composure and speak, her mouth agape.
“Uh… Yandel-san? What’s going on—.”
Seriously, can’t you tell?
I did destroy everything, but the village chief will be up here soon. I don’t have time to explain.
So…
Whack-!
I smash the nearest monster warrior in the face with my hammer, making sure everyone can understand the situation.
“We’re escaping this village, right now!”
