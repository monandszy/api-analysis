##  Interrogation (2)
Raven ascended the stairs to the deck and hurried to the ship's officer's quarters. 
The deputy supervisor, along with all the squad leaders in the battalion, were already gathered there.
"Deputy Commander Raven! You're safe! Thank goodness! We were about to form a support team since your return was delayed—"
"I need to report, so everyone please clear out."
"…Yes? Ah, yes!"
The officers, sensing Raven's urgency, disregarded their questions and obeyed her command.
Within seconds, the officer's quarters emptied.
“…….”
Raven, her face a mix of emotions, placed her hand on the military message stone mounted in the cabin.
"Nia Lapdonia. This is Aruua Raven, Deputy Commander of the Third Magic Battalion. I've just returned, delayed by securing our troops' retreat. Please share the current battlefield situation."
[Nia Lapdonia. This is Eltora Terselion, Chief of Staff of the Third Legion. I was worried when I heard you were going to stop the Blood Knight, but I'm glad you're safe.]
"…Excuse me, but why is the Chief of Staff contacting me, not the Legion Commander…?"
[In wartime, when the highest commander is absent, I am the second-in-command, assuming their role.]
"Absent…?"
[Lord Ramreon, Viscount of Lamreon, has fallen.  He was attacked by a band of criminals led by the traitor Ricardo Lyhenpraha while rallying the troops and moving towards the main force.]
"No way…"
[The attacks ceased after our entire army retreated to the lake, but we can't be certain what will happen next. Remain in command of your troops and stay vigilant until further instructions are given.]
Following this, the information about the known casualties and the enemies who carried out the attack was concisely shared.
And then…
[I think I've relayed everything you need to know. Now it's your turn to tell me. Was it truly the Blood Knight?]
To her superior's inquiry, Raven reported the events without any embellishments.
That she stayed behind to stop the Blood Knight.
That they were engaged in a fierce battle until reinforcements arrived for the enemy.
That she killed the ‘Beacon Keeper’ during the battle, before retreating through a multi-dimensional teleportation spell.
She only briefly mentioned the process, focusing on the results.
It wasn't simply for the sake of saving time.
If it were, she wouldn't have been so hesitant to speak.
[To have dealt with the Beacon Keeper… That's most welcome news. Well done. Inform Blood Raven about the reward for this achievement.]
Her superior believed that Blood Raven was the reason for their success, but the reality was entirely different.
Lihen Schuitz.
It was thanks to that man that no one was harmed by the notorious Blood Knight. He was also the one who killed the Beacon Keeper in the end.
But…
[I shall hang up now.]
Raven couldn't bring herself to say it, not until the very end.
But that wasn't all.
‘Amelia Rainwales.’
She also didn’t mention that woman, who had been as impressive as Blood Raven during the battle. Although she was sure that woman was the one she met on Parune Island, the one from Noirk.
She had deliberately withheld information.
While she hadn't lied, there was no doubt she had shirked her duty as a soldier.
“Haah……”
She, who had always faithfully fulfilled her role, felt a deep pang of guilt.
But what could she do?
She needed time to process her thoughts.
‘Lihen Schuitz…….’
The man who introduced himself with that name.
Until now, she thought that Erwen had been bringing around someone who resembled that person.
However, seeing the [Gigantification] spell made her question.
What if he wasn't a look-alike?
What if that was the reason Erwen called him ‘Uncle’?
What if that person was actually alive?
“……I don't know.”
She was confused.
It was difficult to be certain about anything.
She couldn't help but think that he was that person, yet at the same time, maybe he was just someone with many similarities.
There were many distinct differences too.
‘His height and his face.’
And…
[You… y-y-your back……!]
When she instinctively reached out to the wound, the blood she felt was only hot and sticky.
If it had been his blood, it should have been scalding.
There was another difference.
‘…He's too strong.’
A body that blocked the Blood Knight's aura.
A unique ability that deflected magic.
And the power to manipulate the wind to pull in enemies.
If it had been the old Yandell, he wouldn't have been able to display such prowess against such formidable opponents.
But…
‘Time has passed.’
He might have become stronger after consuming a new essence.
Even Erwen, a member of the Seven Pillars, and herself had changed a lot in the past two years.
‘If that’s the case…’
As Raven sorted through the countless pieces of information that had been thrust upon her, she found herself leaning towards the possibility of Bjorn Yandell being alive.
Amelia's existence was crucial.
Ultimately, she couldn’t find anything, but she could never fully accept his death because of unanswered questions.
Yet, the one who was missing along with him was alive and well?
This implied that he, too, could be alive.
However, the problem was…
‘If he really is Yandell, then what should I do?’
Bjorn Yandell was an Evil Spirit.
The Royal Family had officially announced it, and even before the announcement, Raven knew the truth.
She had seen his expression.
[They say Yandell will be rumored to be an Evil Spirit. That… that isn’t just a rumor, is it?]
Misha, who was the closest to Yandell among the companions, didn't answer.
But her trembling eyes held the truth.
Tick, tick.
Raven bit her nails, something she only did when she was mentally cornered.
She couldn't objectify herself.
One part of her hoped that the man was Yandell, while another part hoped he wasn't.
But…
“What can I do? I have to check.”
Raven finally made up her mind.
She knew.
No matter how afraid she was, she couldn’t delay or escape what needed to be done.
***
No. 399 Silent Cage.
A trap-type Numbers item that activates when a space-transference ability is used within a certain radius.
“That woman… she won't stay away forever, will she?”
“She’ll come. And soon, I think.”
“How are you so sure?”
“This cage won't hold us forever.”
It lasted for two hours after activation, but its cooldown was incredibly long.
‘And you can't attack while she's trapped inside.’
This was the Silent Cage’s fatal flaw.
It was only for ‘restraint’,  so to speak.
Once this item is activated, even external attacks are completely blocked.
Therefore, the usual approach was to trap the target with the Silent Cage, then set up a siege formation and unleash a barrage of attacks once it’s deactivated. 
Thud.
The moment footsteps echoed from beyond the corridor, the soldier acting as guard stood at attention, facing that direction.
“Nia Lapdonia!”
Yes, she’s here.
"Thank you for watching over them. I have things to discuss with them, so could you excuse us? Oh, and please keep everything that happened here secret."
"Yes!"
Raven, who had returned after an hour, was alone.  She had even dismissed the guard, leaving no one to eavesdrop.
It was a positive sign, but she couldn’t relax yet.
As she stood before the cage, quietly observing the interior, I spoke first.
“…What are you going to do with us?”
"Are you still going to use that tone?"
Hmph, she’s coming in strong from the start.
Should I just reveal my identity and try to persuade her to help?
While I was pondering, Raven continued.
"…Take off your helmet."
Since my face had already been revealed once, I readily removed the helmet stained with the Beacon Keeper's blood.
Surprisingly, Raven’s expression didn’t change.
"…And your armor too."
Hmph, what does she think I am?
Men and women don’t sit together at seven years old.
"I can’t comply with inappropriate sexual demands.  Even if I were a woman, I—"
"What are you talking about?"
I tried to explain the logical reason why I couldn't take off my armor, but Raven just glared at me. 
No, actually, she’s kind of scary…
"I haven't reported on you yet. Or Rainwales either. However, if you don’t comply with my request, things will be— "
"I’ll take it off."
"Your… words are… short now."
What’s with that tone? I already have no way out anyway.
Instead of a lengthy reply, I removed the armor that had been torn apart at the back.
And then…
“……!”
For the first time, a change appeared on Raven’s face.
Her gaze, as if troubled, fixated on the tattoo hidden beneath my armor.
Well, at least now my heart is at ease.
"It’s been a while, Raven."
“…….”
"You were expecting this, weren’t you?"
Raven glared at me, her lips pressed together in response to my question.
"Because I’m an Evil Spirit?"
"Yes. It would have been better if you had only good memories of me…"
Raven’s voice trailed off in a melancholic tone.
It made my heart clench too.
Yes, you can’t accept the fact that I’m an Evil Spirit.
“Wait!”
“……?”
"Raven, it’s a misunderstanding that I'm an Evil Spirit."
I quickly began the process of persuasion.
"A misunderstanding?"
"Yes, I'm not an Evil Spirit."
"Then what about that appearance?"
Raven clenched her fist, her eyes fixed on me.
"It looks like you consumed an essence like the ‘Bonnite’ that Ainarr consumed, which shrinks your height.  If you're not an Evil Spirit, why would you go to such lengths to hide your identity?"
Yes, I knew that question was coming.
"When I returned, the Royal Family had already made that announcement.  After checking things out, I found some suspicious points. That's why I've been hiding my identity for a while."
“……I admit there are suspicious points in that announcement. But for a while? And returned, you say? What does that even mean?”
Okay, I think I’ve successfully sparked her curiosity.
"It's a long story. There's something called the Fragment of Records—"
“Wait!"
Just as I was about to explain what happened, Raven interrupted, cutting off our conversation.
"No need to go into details. This will be enough."
Raven's hand held a familiar object.
No. 7234 Shattered Trust.
An item that consumes charges and, when activated, prevents those within 10 meters from lying.
"You know what this is, don’t you, Yandell? It’s the item that Parteiyan gave you in the Doppelganger Forest.  I had some leftover military funds, so I replaced the used charges."
Whew, she really did her homework.
Whirring-!
The second hand on the compass-sized disc began to move, as if she had even turned on the power.
And in that state, she asked.
“Now, tell me. Is it really a misunderstanding?”
Raven’s gaze pierced me as she asked.
‘…It’ll be fine, right?’
I was still quite nervous, even though I thought it would be fine.
I’d never actually confirmed whether the ‘gift’ from Auril Gavius worked.
I planned to buy something like ‘Shattered Trust’ and confirm it before going to the verification stage.
But…
"Raven, it truly is a misunderstanding. I'm not an Evil Spirit."
Yes, I’m saying that, so the ‘gift’ is working, rig—
Click.
The second hand, which had been turning smoothly, stopped.
“……What did you do?”
“Uh……”
As I trailed off, the second hand began to move again.
Was it a temporary glitch?
"I, I don’t know…."
I hastily denied it, and the Shattered Trust stopped working again, making a ticking sound.
And then…
Tick, tick.
After a moment, it began to move again.
“……Why does the ‘Shattered Trust’ stop when Yandell speaks?”
I swallowed hard at Raven’s question.
‘No, he said it wouldn’t be affected by these items anymore…’
Damn old man.
If this is how it’s going to be, he should have told me beforehand!
