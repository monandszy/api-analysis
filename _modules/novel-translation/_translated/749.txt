The Guide (6)
I once saw a news report about a war, a video of a missile strike in a country embroiled in civil war. The footage, presented as reference material, was incredibly short.  A building, seemingly sturdy and well-constructed, stood under a bright, sunny sky. Laundry hung peacefully on its balconies, creating an almost idyllic scene. Then…
One second. That's all it took.  One second from the moment the missile appeared in the distance, hurtling towards the building, to its complete destruction.  Just one second. Watching that brief clip, I felt a profound sense of inevitability.
Even the most physically gifted athlete, a powerful figure surrounded by scores of bodyguards, a hardened veteran who had spent decades on the battlefield – none could have countered it.  How could they possibly have reacted? How could one evade or deflect something moving with such speed and force?  The people inside that building likely never even registered the missile's existence before the impact. Perhaps they heard a warning siren, but…
The point is, that's not important right now.
“Damn it…”
Right now, a missile is hurtling toward me.  It's approaching at an impossible speed, defying all sense of perspective, seeming utterly unreal.  But…
‘Focus.’
I don't feel the same sense of inevitability I felt watching that video.  This world is teeming with explorers who transcend human limits, not just elite athletes.  Though, this ‘Thunderbolt’ is certainly no pushover.
“Everyone, close in!”
I gather my comrades around me. Of course, with over a thousand troops, I can't possibly cover them all alone…but…
I feel it.  A gut feeling.
WOOOOOOOONG!
That missile is heading straight for me.
“Damn…”
I have two choices. The first is to combine [Transcendence] and [Gigantification] to maximize my size.  The Aegis barrier’s strength is directly proportional to my size, meaning if I can manage a 'Guard', I could block it without taking any damage.  But…
‘…It won't work.’
Watching the Thunderbolt’s relentless approach, I quickly reassess.
‘It’s not a nuclear bomb.’
Why is it so huge? Even if I can use [Gigantification] twice, it won't be big enough to act as a shield. Therefore…
Only one option remains.
「The character has activated [Transcendence].」
「The next skill used will be enhanced.」
I activate [Transcendence] first. Then, I cast the skill to be empowered.
「The character has activated [Impregnable Fortress].」
「The power of the Transcendent allows the skill's latent abilities to be unlocked.」
Normally, this active skill only increases the effect of the [Evolutionary Carapace] by 1.5 times. I’ve rarely used Transcendence with this skill in actual combat.  Honestly, I've only tested it a few times for fun, in situations that hardly count as real combat.  It has a fatal flaw: once activated, it's impossible to deactivate until all my soul power is depleted…and…
「[Evolutionary Carapace] temporarily changes to [Changeable Carapace].」
Even the outcome is left to chance.
「Physical Resistance is 750 or higher.」
「The character gains three special effects.」
The moment the skill activates, a whirlwind engulfs my body.
「Storm's Blessing.」
「Damage taken increases by 70%, but grants absolute immunity to all wind attributes.」
The first effect is useless; the Thunderbolt is hardly wind-based. It's not just useless; it's the worst possible outcome, drastically increasing the damage I take…
Swoosh-!
My skin hardens, and sharp points jut out from my knuckles, even piercing the calloused flesh.
「Warrior's Blood.」
「When dealing damage with fists, damage increases by 15 times.」
This is a good effect. Throwing away my hammer and shield, pummeling monsters with my bare fists was incredibly fun, and my comrades enjoyed watching.  But…
‘Oh, man…’
What am I supposed to do with this now? It’s a thousand times better than the first effect, which only gave me a debuff, but…
Finally, the last effect is revealed—
“Yandel…? You… you have horns on your head…!”
Upon hearing Rottmiller's words, I inwardly cursed. I needed no further confirmation.
「Demon Devourer.」
「Upon defeating an evil-attribute monster, temporarily absorb its abilities.」
Great, the last one is useless too. I can't use this in the middle of a city without monsters.
‘Ugh…’
This is precisely why I haven't used the [Changeable Carapace] before.  Each ability is powerful; in the right situation, it could unleash incredible power…but…
That's never a guarantee.
‘I'm screwed.’
My mind goes blank, the situation far exceeding mere disappointment. The second and third carapace effects were okay, but the first one…a 70% damage increase. I secretly hoped that even if the Thunderbolt hit me, I could survive, but now even that is uncertain.
But it was a necessary choice.  The only way to save the countless people around me was with the [Changeable Carapace].  Of course, even so, it was a gamble I’d never take normally…
‘Damn fate-manipulators.’
The record states that three comrades will die.  Optimistically interpreted, it means no more than three will die.  Therefore, I hoped 'that' would appear, because if that thing explodes, it won't be just three who die.
CLANG-
But what can I do? If I can’t run, I have to fight.
Swoosh.
After one last look at the approaching Thunderbolt, I raise my shield like an umbrella, blocking above. Rottmiller and many of my comrades are positioned beneath, while several in the rear haven't yet reached my side.
‘Please.’
As I brace myself for the impact, focusing all my strength, a final prayer on my lips…
‘Huh…?’
Suddenly, a brilliant white light erupts.  It's my armor.  At first, I think my comrades have used some magic or other ability…but…
WHOOSH-!
It doesn’t take long to realize this isn’t magic or any ability I know.
‘Aegis Dragon Armor.’
A passive ability, a persistent power that remains unlocked ever since I obtained the armor; its activation conditions remain unknown.
「The Noble Guardian deems the wearer's life to be in danger.」
The conditions remain a mystery.
「All resistance stats increase tenfold for ten seconds.」
The exact effects are also unknown. But…
WHOOSH-!
Large black wings sprout from my back, spreading wide. This is one of the hundreds of possible forms the [Changeable Carapace] can take…
「Character's Physical Resistance is 1500 or higher.」
「Character gains a new special effect.」
It’s what I wished for.
「The Hanged Man.」
The effect is simple.
「Soul power consumption increases 25 times.」
「The character shares all damage taken.」
「The character's health will not fall below 1%.」
With this special effect, I can’t die, regardless of the injuries.  And…
「The character can use [Realm Proclamation].」
A new active skill is added; usable only once while the skill is active.  Naturally, I use it immediately.
‘Realm Proclamation.’
The instant I mentally command it, a black wave radiates outwards from me like ripples on a lake.
WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOSH-!
Everything within the wave's reach loses its color, transforming into a monochrome world, like a scene from a black-and-white film.
「The power of the Great Sacrificer descends upon this area.」
「The character takes all damage inflicted upon every being within their line of sight.」
I relax, tightening my grip on my shield. Then…
————————————!
Finally, the Thunderbolt strikes the ground.
***
I couldn't see. The world was just light. There was no sound. A white void. I wasn't there. No pain, no anxieties, no sorrow.  There was no time, because I couldn't perceive it.
「The Noble Guardian's soul loses its strength.」
The white void gradually faded, long or short, it was difficult to tell. The pure white space slowly darkened, and faintly, sounds emerged.
“……! ……!”
“……!”
Someone was shouting. The sounds were too faint to understand, but the emotions within were crystal clear.
Blink.
I opened my eyes.  Whether I actually closed them, I don't know. Regardless…
“…….”
“……!”
My senses began to return.  A feeling of being shaken. A sensation of being carried rapidly. And…
「Character has taken damage.」
「Damage is accumulating.」
「Character has taken damage.」
「Damage is accumulating…」
It wasn't pain.
CRUNCH-!
I only felt the sensation of my heart bursting, my lungs tearing, my bones shattering, my muscles twisting.  You know that feeling when you get a tooth pulled? No pain, just a strange sensation? It was exactly like that.
「Character has taken damage.」
「Damage is accumulating.」
「Character has taken damage.」
「Damage is accumulating…」
But my body wasn't only breaking down.
「[Supreme Healing] effect rapidly regenerating the body.」
「[Supreme Healing] effect rapidly regenerating the body.」
「[Supreme Healing] effect rapidly regenerating the…」
Even as my body was rapidly destroyed, inside and out, I felt it simultaneously healing. Shattered bones realigned, torn heart muscle reconnected, and lost blood rapidly replenished.
「Character has taken damage.」
「Damage is accumulating.」
「[Supreme Healing] effect rapidly regenerating the body.」
It was like alternating between a hot bath and an ice bath thousands of times a second.
「Character's soul power is below 10%.」
Yet, with time, my consciousness sharpened. Who I am, what I did, and my current state. Things I could only perceive with intense focus were now clear, even external information.
“…This way!!”
A desperate voice called out. But…whose?  I couldn't tell.
BOOOOOOOOOM-!
An explosion.  The sensation of being lifted into the air, then…
Tumble.
I rolled across the ground. I felt these sensations, but like a drunkard, I had no control over my body—
“…Damn it!!”
“M-my wounds aren't healing!”
“Potions! More potions!!  Even if they’re not supreme-grade!”
They're all working hard.  Though, it's not really hard work; they're just picking up the pieces because of me.
‘Amelia…’
How will she react when she finds out what I did? She definitely won’t praise me.
‘…I shouldn’t tell her.’
Yes, that's best. Telling her I had a reasonable chance of survival, and that this was the only way to save everyone…she wouldn't understand.
“…Yandel! Yandel! Yandel! Can you hear me?”
…Huh?
‘What? Why can I move?’
I opened my eyes.  I don’t know how much time passed, but when I opened my eyes, only one person was visible.
“T-thank goodness.”
Brown Rottmiller. The scout of Team Half-Penny, my first party, a treasured comrade from our precious days together.
“How are you feeling? Can you stand? We need to get out of here!”
He spoke urgently, and I slowly rose.  Something was clearly urgent.  My body had mostly recovered, and moving wouldn’t be a problem.  So…
“Don’t worry. I can move—.”
Before I could finish…
「Character's soul power is insufficient.」
「[Changeable Carapace] ends.」
The temporary changes to my body vanished. The whirlwind, the horns on my forehead, the grotesquely enlarged knuckles, the black wings on my back.  The physical changes didn’t matter.  The only problem was…
「The Hanged Man effect has been removed.」
「Accumulated damage is calculated.」
The ‘debt’ I had been paying gradually was now being demanded all at once.
“Ah…”
I’m screwed.
Pshhhh-!
I felt something forcefully erupting from every pore in my body, and…
Slump.
I collapsed to the ground, exactly where I had been trying to stand.
