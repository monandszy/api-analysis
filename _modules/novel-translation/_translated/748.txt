The Guide (5)
Lotmiller's navigational skills proved exceptional.  It was only natural; intuition, after all, is far more attuned to misfortune than to fortune.  Indeed, shortly after Lotmiller had indicated danger ahead, the enemy appeared.
“About seventy…,” I muttered, estimating their number.
Their force numbered approximately seventy—significantly fewer than ours.  Yet, there was one individual who demanded particular caution…
“Red Axe Jack! A notorious criminal reportedly inducted into Orculis over a decade ago.  Proceed with caution—”
Unfortunately, he wasn't there.
“Erwen Fornaci di Tercia has cast [Rupture].”
*KAAAAAAAANG!*
Judging by Lotmiller’s previous comments, Red Axe Jack seemed to be a formidable figure, yet Erwen's single arrow sent his head flying.
"Did I do well?" she asked, her voice light.
"Yes, very well done," I replied.
"How…how could it be so easy...?" Lotmiller mumbled, his voice hollow.
It wasn't surprising.  His retirement, in a sense, had been triggered by the Dragonslayer War.  We fought desperately there, barely surviving through sacrifice. But…
'That was years ago,' I thought.
There was no reason to cower at the name 'Orculis' now. Especially given that the Corpse Collector and the Dragonslayer were among the top ranks within Orculis.  A nobody with a name like Red Axe Jack was inconsequential.
"I've only heard stories until now… you've truly grown stronger," he stated, his voice laced with respect.
Well, I had been fighting desperately ever since, invoking the name of my ancestral gods.
“Behel—RAAAAAAAAAGGGGHHHHH!!!”
Charging forward like a tank, the enemy, leaderless, offered little resistance.
“…Jack! Lord Jack’s been taken down!”
“……Run!”
My frontal assault shattered heads one after another; the enemy, panic-stricken, fled for their lives.  Pursuing them all would be difficult…
“Hey,” I called out, halting the chase. I decided to apprehend several seemingly high-ranking survivors for interrogation.
"What were you doing here? With such a paltry force?" I demanded.
"We… we were…"
"You refuse to answer?!"
*KWAJIK!*
I split open one man's skull as an example, and before I could question the next, information poured forth.
"W-we are scouts!"
"Scouts?"
"Yes! Our mission was to patrol the battlefield, gathering intelligence and reporting to command!"
In short, they were human radars, deployed to swiftly contact the main force upon encountering enemies or significant threats.
"Oh, so you're well-acquainted with the current situation, then?"
“…Yes! Of course!”
The man's confident answer reflected his knowledge, providing me with a comprehensive overview of the battle. The royal army from Sector 5 had entered Sector 7, and the Sector 7 main force was engaged in a full-scale confrontation.
This information wasn't unexpected; I had requested military deployment that morning. The most vital piece of information was this:
"The commander is still in Sector 7?"
"Yes! While I, a mere grunt, don't know what he's doing exactly, his presence in Sector 7 is certain!"
"Have you heard anything about Aruah Raven?"
"Aruah Raven… you mean the Golden Sorceress?"
"Yes."
"I'm sorry. I don't know…"
Tch. So that's it…
Where had Raven and Astarotta disappeared to?  I posed the same question to other candidates, but received similar answers. The interrogation was over. Time to finish this and move on…
“Excuse me…”
The man suddenly spoke hesitantly.
“If it’s not too much trouble, could you spare my life?”
What was he trying to say? His quick wit was impressive, yet somehow comical.
“If you’re released, I swear to remain hidden in the sewers until the war's end. I truly mean it. Please believe me.”
A unique type, perhaps?  Many had begged for mercy, but none so politely. However…
"No."
Some things are simply non-negotiable.  My resolute refusal elicited a fearful yet strained smile from the man.
“…Ahahaha, y-yes? Please, make it quick!”
He had provided valuable information.  A swift death was…
’…Wait, something’s wrong.’
An unsettling premonition stopped me from raising my hammer.
A subtle shift. It felt less like instinct, more like experience. Years of betrayals had warned me.  I couldn’t articulate it, but something felt off.
"Bersil, use a verification spell."
"It's highly unlikely to work at this level."
"Try it anyway."
Following my orders, Bersil silently cast the spell. And…
"It doesn't work, as expected."
The spell failed, but it wasn't a setback; I had anticipated it.
Tap, tap…
I quietly tapped my thigh with my index finger. I had been observing him: his reaction to the mention and the casting of the verification spell.
"…This is an interesting one."
“…W-what do you mean? I swear I told the truth!”
I wondered if that was truly the case.
"You'll soon find out."
I retrieved the "Fractured Trust" from my subspace. Only one use remained, but something felt deeply unsettling.
'I can get more later…'
Yes, I decided, let's use it.  As I was about to activate it…
“Kkkkkk…hehehehe…”
The man suddenly doubled over, convulsing with laughter. As if his previous demeanor was entirely an act.
"What are you doing?"
"Kehehe, Bjorn Jandel…"
"I asked what you're doing!"
"This is where you meet your end!"
The curse, spat with chilling intensity.  The man then collapsed forward.
*Thud!*
Misha, beside me, gasped, checking his pulse.
“Bjorn…? He’s dead…?”
Oh, what now? This is unnerving.
***
A vast stone chamber bathed in bright light. Below, a mountain of corpses.
One, two, three, four…
Counting was pointless. Thousands, easily.  They shared a single common trait:  all were shriveled like desiccated vegetables…
*Thump!*
Then, the ceiling opened, spewing forth dozens more corpses.
*KAANG!*
The ceiling closed again, leaving a strange silence. And…
….
The man at the entrance did not avert his gaze.  He frowned, as if in pain, yet his steely resolve was evident as he observed the scene intently.  After an unknown time…
“Ah, you’re here!  The charging is complete, my lord, Marquis Tercerion.”
“Indeed… Let us ascend.”
The Marquis left the subterranean chamber and emerged above ground. A courtyard surrounded by a high wall. In the center stood a massive magical weapon connected to dozens of pipes. Its official name: Thunder. One of three ancient magical weapons possessed by the royal family. Strictly speaking, it was just a part of Thunder, but anyway…
"A truly remarkable device, wouldn't you agree?  Simply by processing useless humans, it can unleash enough power to raze the entire royal palace."
The Marquis turned to the man beside him.
"All thanks to you, Marquis. Had this remained in the royal family's hands, this war could not have begun."
Though aged, the man was powerfully built, his eyes possessing a fervor surpassing any youth. Noirark's castellan.
"It's belated, but… Marquis, why did you decide to rebel against the royal family?"
….
"We're in this together, so let's have a frank discussion. You suddenly contacted us, claiming to seize Thunder, to side with us when war begins, and yet, you claim no desire for the throne. This naturally causes us concern, regarding your true intentions, Marquis.”
“Hatred…”
“…Excuse me?”
“Let's just say, hatred.”
The Marquis’s curt reply prompted an awkward chuckle from the castellan.
“…Ahahaha! The Dawn King, it seems he did something unforgivable to our Marquis!”
The Marquis replied with a wry smile. And…
….
….
A strange silence descended.  The castellan, visibly uncomfortable, broke the silence with a new question.
"But why continue charging? Thunder is under your control, Marquis, and I assumed you had a plan. But… had this been used sooner, we could have already secured over half of Lapdonia."
The Marquis let out a long sigh.
"I'm waiting for the right moment.  A more significant moment."
"Is there anything more significant than gaining half of Lapdonia?"
"I believe so."
"I see…"
The castellan, seemingly bored, lingered, engaging in idle chatter before departing, claiming other matters needed his attention.  After some time…
*Thud, thud.*
A man in knightly attire entered the building, paying his respects to the Marquis.  The Marquis didn't speak at length.
"Found him?"
He asked simply, and the knight nodded.
"Yes, my lord. Bjorn Jandel's location has finally been pinpointed."
The time has come.
***
Every event has a precursor.  For instance, hair standing on end signals impending lightning; a mass exodus of rodents, insects, or birds suggests a high probability of an earthquake.  What about the current situation?
"The pursuers?"
"They’re still following, watching."
Following the interrogatee’s frenzied suicide, we were relentlessly stalked. A subtle, yet malicious pursuit.
"Can we apprehend them?"
"I doubt it.  They're too far; even Erwen's marksmanship is insufficient at this distance."
They had yet to harm us; merely keeping their distance while tailing us. The problem, however, was…
Thump.
This made me even more uneasy.  The man who spoke ominously before dying, and these relentless pursuers—all felt like ominous signs.
"Increase speed."
I accelerated our movement, but inexplicably, the pursuers vanished. Or rather…
"Lotmiller."
"…I’m not sure where to go.  I have a very bad feeling about this…"
Even our usually reliable navigation had failed.  The final straw:
“……Bjorn?  They’ve stopped following!”
The surveillance had abruptly ceased.  More precisely…
"They aren't stopping."
….
"They’re increasing their distance."
The pursuers suddenly turned and distanced themselves. What could this mean?  An unrelated thought struck me. If you see the tide receding rapidly from the coast, you should get out of there immediately…
*PHEEEEEEWWWWWWW!*
A jet-like roar echoed from afar, causing everyone to duck instinctively.  I was the exception.
'What is it?'
As the protector responsible for everyone's safety, I held my head high and surveyed the surroundings. And…
….
I momentarily doubted my eyes.  From the direction of Sector 4, supposedly occupied by Noirark, a colossal object was rapidly descending in a parabolic arc. I wondered what it was, but…
"Thunder… it's Thunder!!"
Unlike me, who was underground when Thunder was last deployed, my comrades instantly recognized it.  A curse escaped my lips.
"Damn it…"
Missile strikes are not fair.
