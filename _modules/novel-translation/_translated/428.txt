## Chapter 428:  Ice-Like (3)
The Six Rose of the Rose Knights. 
The man, Regal Bagos, couldn’t help but laugh when he caught sight of her defeat in the battle from a distance. 
‘What an idiot. She boasted about being able to take it on alone.’
He had been closely watching their fight since the battle began. 
After all, he needed to stop her before she killed that barbarian, if Six Rose were to win. 
A peaceful death was a luxury for that barbarian.
His plan was to use [Servant Transformation] to enslave him and make him suffer for the rest of his life. 
If, by some unfortunate chance, he were to die before that, he intended to absorb his soul and boost his stats.
‘Well, maybe it’s a good thing? The barbarian’s down too.’ 
Pretending to fight, he slipped away from the front line while maintaining a semblance of order. 
He quickly headed towards where he had been watching. 
Thump, thump.
The distance rapidly shrinking.
‘It would be amusing to make him fight against them, using him as a servant.’
He was full of such expectations as he approached.
“Regal, Bagos……”
A tiny voice, trembling with fear.
And then……
Whiiiiish-!
A dangerous tearing sound followed close behind.
Kang!
He hurriedly turned around and parried the arrow with his sword. 
A fairy stood there, glaring at him from where the arrow had come.
“…Yes, it was you.”
One of the members of the Seven Pillars.
Blood Spirit, Erwen Fornachi di Tersia.
Slurp.
Regal Bagos licked his lips as he always did, but he couldn’t shake off a sense of déjà vu.
‘It’s like I’ve seen this face somewhere before, but I can’t quite remember where.’
It wasn't a question that mattered to him.
***
Reality is different from the tragedies depicted in stories.
As proof, it didn’t rain or thunder that day.  It wasn’t the day the revolution began, and it wasn’t even a dark night where the stars wouldn’t appear.
It was an ordinary afternoon, just like any other.
[Erwen, if you keep causing trouble, a scary Barbarian will come and punish you!]
Mother, as usual, scolded her.
[Well, well. She’ll get it eventually.]
Father was kind.
[Waaaah!]
The little sister cried at every opportunity.
[Daria, where has she gone off to again……]
The mischievous older sister had only come home in the early hours of the morning and was still taking a nap.
Everything was ordinary, just another day.
Knock, knock.
Until a knock came from the front door.
[Who is it?]
Father answered the door instead of Mother, who was doing chores, and from that moment on, tragedy began.
[Yo, Elf……? Why are you here…  Cough-!]
[I need fame, and the Elves are the easiest to kill.]
[Waaaah!]
[Mi, Miriane! Take the children and run!]
While Father tried to stop the intruder, Mother grabbed our three sisters and ran. 
But we were caught before we could get far.
And then……
[Please…. Take my children and run away.]
[… I understand, Sister.]
[Thank you… my kind little sister.]
We three sisters were saved by our uncle, who happened to be passing by.
Mother sacrificed herself after Father, but we were still fortunate.  Over a thousand people had died that day.
My sister was there.
My younger sister was there.
That’s why we could endure it.
But…….
[That young lady has the most fortune after you, young man.]
My older sister died.
[The eldest… is gone?]
It was because of me.
My relationship with my younger sister grew distant.
Still, I could endure it.
[Listen to me. I’m your protector now.]
The man who risked everything to protect me when I was in danger.
The man who reached out to me, lifting me up when I thought I would crumble.
But reality was cruelly harsh.
[So, Bjorn is dead.]
The moment I realized that he was gone too, after my older sister.
Erwen couldn’t contain the overwhelming emotions.
Why must I lose everything?
Why does the little happiness I finally get shatter so easily?
The reason was too simple.
Because I’m weak.
Because I need to be protected.
They protected me, but I couldn't protect them.
[The process of gaining the power of the bloodline is far more terrifying than you imagine, and it’s not something you can just achieve by simply wanting it.]
I wanted to be strong.
Now that there is nothing left to protect.
I wanted to show those who took everything from me.
The pain of being taken from.
[The Spirit King of Darkness, Dicloe…….]
Such dark emotions gave her power.
She used that power to take revenge.
She was called a madwoman obsessed with blood.
But her essence remained the same.
Tremble, tremble, tremble….
Her fingertips tremble.
“Regal, Bagos……”
If she stays like this, she’ll lose everything again.
She knows that, yet her whole body stiffens.
She’s grown stronger than she was back then, but her weak essence, the one that made her only lose, remains the same.
But…….
Thump-
She can’t be like that.
If she’s going to regret it like that again…….
[Barbarian—!!!!]
It’s better to die.
Ziiiiip,
She pulls the bowstring.
Thump.
She releases the string.
Whiiiiish-!
The arrow flies with fierce force, despite not containing any abilities.
Kang!
The barbarian parries the arrow with his sword, drawing it back immediately.
And then.
“…Yes, it was you.”
She drags her body, marked with fear, forward.
Thud, thud.
The distance closes in an instant, demonstrating her growth.
Whiiiish-!
She wields a dagger, not her bow.
“A bowman attacking with a knife?”
Because she can’t use the power of the spirits anymore.
More importantly, Bjorn Yandel is here.
She can’t use a bowman’s fighting style, which focuses on distance and evasion.
But…….
Kang-!
As the dagger clashes with the barbarian’s sword, she spins her body and unleashes a barrage of attacks.
Thud!
The barbarian stumbles back, surprised by the fierce blow.
Good, she’s pushed him back, and she has secured a position next to the Barbarian.
“What is it, you……”
Erwen lowered her body and extended the short dagger forward. 
It was a basic stance she learned from her older sister.
Back then, she had complained about having to learn this.
[I told you. You need to be able to protect yourself, even if you don’t have a bow or can’t use the spirits.]
It’s clear now. 
She was only being protected.
No need for long explanations.
“……Damn bastards.”
The barbarian cursed and charged at her.
Erwen observed his every movement, not flinching even as he got closer.
Her mind was surprisingly peaceful.
“Huu……”
She can’t use the essence of the spirits either.
She had used the embodied ability [Harmony], possessed by the patrol elf Ertes, to convert her soul power into natural power to aid the Barbarian’s fight.
She has a bit of natural power left, but it’s too little to use properly.
All she has left is this.
‘Just one dagger.’
The dagger technique she learned from her older sister. 
Even that is far inferior to a close-combat explorer like Amelia.
No, it definitely is.
There’s no point comparing her to an explorer who has wielded a sword her whole life.
But…….
“So what?”
Until the very end. 
She focuses her energy on the dagger, observing the barbarian’s movement.
For just one goal.
“The Barbarian……”
No, he’s not really the Barbarian anymore.
He’s the same age, and he doesn’t look so rough anymore.
People would think it’s weird if they heard that.
So…….
“I’ll protect Bjorn Yandel.”
She has decided to stop depending on anyone.
***
Give up, it’s easier.
A popular phrase often found on the internet.
Even if the self-deprecating nuance is a bit uncomfortable, the content of the phrase itself is true.
[Regal Bagos has used [Fear Imprinting].]
Giving up is easier.
Just like how not expecting anything prevents you from getting hurt.
You can quickly draw a line and protect yourself from things you can’t do.
Yes, just like right now.
[Strong mental fortitude.]
[Erwen Fornachi di Tersia resists [Fear Imprinting].]
The moment you let go of the burden, an unparalleled comfort washes over you.
The bothersome noise fades away, and instead of the nagging pain, a warm darkness envelops your body.
It’s a comfort like you’ve returned to childhood.
Sometimes, this place is more comfortable than a place of bright light.
[Erwen Fornachi di Tersia has taken damage.]
Of course, I wasn’t always like this.
A plain and ordinary kid who dreamed of being a hero.
[Regal Bagos roars loudly.]
[Erwen Fornachi di Tersia roars back, even louder.]
But at some point, I started to dislike hero stories.
Wasn’t it stupid?
Why should I sacrifice myself for others?
That question changed my way of life.
I became more comfortable, and stronger.
But…….
[Amelia Rainwales has used [Suragak].]
[A fatal blow.]
[Eight Rose has been defeated.]
When did that start?
[[Bleeding] is ongoing.]
[Warning: The character’s HP is below 5%. If not healed soon, the character may die.]
A new question arises.
[Titana Akuraba shouts that she needs to save her companion.]
[Periton Eriavosti has used [Salvation].]
[Bogus Richmont has used [Opposing Darkness].]
[The Divine spell is ineffective due to the intervention of the Evil God.]
Maybe it was a mental defect I got from entering the Barbarian’s body.
[Meland Kaislan moves to save his comrade.]
[Anne Parvella leaves the front line and blocks the knight’s path.]
But one thing is certain.
[A powerful blow of luck.]
[Anne Parvella has been defeated.]
[The Evil God’s priestess, who lost her lover, rages.]
I don’t want to give up anymore.
Not just my life, but everything else too.
[Bogus Richmont has used [Flesh Offering].]
[The right arm is sacrificed to increase the next spell’s power by 5 times.]
[Bogus Richmont has used [Corpse Flower].]
Greed arises.
[Meland Kaislan suffers critical injuries and is incapacitated.]
Even if that greed hurts me.
A deep desire that I can no longer be afraid of or ignore.
[A powerful stroke of misfortune.]
[Punishment – Equivalent Exchange activated.]
[50% of the damage inflicted by Bogus Richmont is returned.]
But…….
[The Evil God’s priestess, sensing death, screams out a hateful curse.]
What was I doing?
[Bogus Richmont has used [Flesh Offering].]
[The left arm is sacrificed to increase the next spell’s power by 5 times.]
[Bogus Richmont has used [Flesh Offering].]
[Both eyes are sacrificed to increase the next spell’s power by 5 times.]
[Bogus Richmont uses [Flesh Offering]…….]
[…….]
The sounds are distant, and the pain is dull.
The surroundings are dark and lonely.
[Bogus Richmont summons [Executioner].]
[Ravienia Storows suffers critical injuries and is incapacitated.]
[Sven Parav suffers the status ailment [Fear].]
I feel like I’ve forgotten something.
[Strong mental fortitude.]
[Sven Parav resists [Fear].]
[Sven Parav leaves the front line and defends against the Executioner’s attack.]
[Sven Parav sweats profusely and screams for help.]
I try to recall my memories.
[Amelia Rainwales makes a choice after much deliberation.]
[She attacks Regal Bagos instead of the Executioner.]
[Sven Parav is astonished.]
What have I forgotten?
[Executioner begins to rampage.]
[Sven Parav is incapacitated.]
[Tsuon Iriburn has died.]
[Lilis Marone clenches her fist and resolves.]
[Rhead Ashed grabs Lilis Marone’s wrist and shakes his head.]
I definitely had something I needed to do.
[Rhead Ashed uses the 7th Grade Mental Magic ‘Thought Acceleration.’]
[Rhead Ashed uses the 6th Grade Acceleration Magic ‘Mana Amplification.’]
[Rhead Ashed uses the 8th Grade Magic ‘Heart Stimulation’….]
[…….]
I definitely had something I promised to never repeat.
[Rhead Ashed unleashes magic.]
[The Executioner, heavily injured, screams.]
Ugh, my head hurts.
[Eleven Rose uses [Absolute Cut].]
[Puta Ricoben suffers critical injuries.]
[An unbelievable counterattack.]
[Eleven Rose has been defeated.]
I want to rest, but I force myself to keep thinking.
[Nine Rose uses [Absolute Cut].]
[Puta Ricoben is incapacitated.]
[An unbelievable counterattack.]
[Nine Rose has been defeated.]
[Puta Ricoben has died.]
I was struggling to recall what I’d forgotten.
[Titana Akuraba’s mana is insufficient for the skill to activate.]
[Manua Reveles uses [Iron Fist].]
[Amelia Rainwales is knocked back.]
[Executioner uses [Earth Quake].]
Kuuung-!
[Character takes falling debris damage.]
The surroundings shake violently, and suddenly I can’t breathe.
[Warning: The character’s HP has reached 0%.]
[Starting countdown.]
[3 mana points are consumed per second. (493/496)]
[3 mana points are consumed per second. (490/496)]
[3 mana points are consumed per second. (487/496)]
What is this?
[Periton Eriavosti resolves to sacrifice.]
[Benjamin Orman resolves to sacrifice.]
[The Great Observer smiles at their noble wills.]
I don’t know.
[Exterminate Evil.]
I feel like I don’t care anymore.
[All Evil-Attribute characters and monsters within range take heavy damage.]
[Executioner is desummoned.]
[Periton Eriavosti has died.]
[Benjamin Orman has died.]
Time goes by.
[Rhead Ashed unleashes magic.]
[Thirteen Rose has been defeated…….]
My mind grows dull.
[Rhead Ashed’s mana has been depleted.]
[Rhead Ashed smiles and asks for help with the aftermath.]
In the ensuing silence.
[Rhead Ashed has died.]
The faces I miss flit before my eyes like phantoms.
[Gould Aldidi moves toward Sven Parav.]
[Sven Parav shakes his head and refuses treatment.]
I close my eyes tightly.
[Gould Aldidi begins to run.]
[Manua Repeles uses [Wind Pressure].]
[Gould Aldidi suffers critical injuries.]
[Amelia Rainwales inflicts heavy damage on Manua Repeles.]
I know I should open them.
But like a spoiled child, I whine.
[Gould Aldidi moves.]
I’ve done enough.
[Gould Aldidi moves.]
I’ve done my best.
[Gould Aldidi moves.]
But…….
[Gould Aldidi stops.]
Why?
[Gould Aldidi uses [Blood Transfusion].]
Thump-!
[Character recovers.]
[Character recovers.]
[Character recovers…….]
A warm energy envelops my fading body.
[The character’s HP has recovered to 1% or more.]
[Countdown terminated.]
The warmth makes me instinctively realize.
Thump-!
Yes, it’s too late.
[Character awakens from [Unconscious] state.]
It’s too late to give up. 
***
My eyes open.
The first thing I see is the old man, Aldidi.
“Wa, wake up…. Thank goodness… thank goodness……”
He’s gasping for breath, looking down at me.
He smells strongly of blood.
Swoosh.
My gaze falls.
“Aldidi……”
“Ah, this… a wound…. I got hurt a little on the way here.”
Aldidi tries to cover his abdomen with his palm, as if to hide it. 
It was a useless act.
He couldn’t hide the wound with that.
“We need to treat it—”
Aldidi cuts me off before I can finish my mumbling.
“Impossible.”
“……?”
“Saving you, buried under the rocks, was my last act. We’re out of potions now, aren’t we?”
I can’t understand.
“Why… why did you……”
“Parav-kyung said… that he could endure it, so he told me to save you first.”
Aldidi laughs.
“Everyone knows it. You’re the one who… dies if you die.”
“…….”
“Listen, Yandel……”
Aldidi bends over, coughing up blood.
But did he have something he wanted to say?
“The only thing that can make our deaths not meaningless… is you. You are the only one. I can’t do it. So……”
I couldn’t accept it.
What is a death that is not meaningless?
Even if you roll around in a dung heap, you have to live to be meaningful.
Yet.
“You have to survive.”
Aldidi says.
“You are… a giant, aren’t you?”
Giant.
The nickname I earned after fighting in the Crystal Cave.
“It’s only you. The one who can move forward, even bearing the burden of those who died here today……”
“Aldidi, I’m not a giant, I….”
“Don’t be weak. You can do it.”
“…….”
“I… who couldn’t die, even though I wanted to, to avenge my granddaughter, am standing here!  To save you. Because I believed you could do it…….”
I’m speechless.
“So……”
It’s as if his faith is a mountain pressing down on my shoulders.
“No matter what… you are a giant.”
Aldidi’s life fades.
Clench.
I clench my fists, holding back the faint sound of a cough that threatens to erupt.
I’m not a giant or anything.
I’m just an ordinary person who wants to live.
Why are you trying to make me do that?  I want to shout back.
But I hold it in.
“……Don’t worry.”
Because that’s not what I need to say now.
I say it without averting my gaze.
“I will fulfill everything you… you all wished for. You can believe me. I… swear on this warrior’s heart.”
I spoke with a firm voice, but I wasn’t sure.
Can I really keep that promise?
Even as I spoke, I was filled with doubts.
Whether he knew or not.
“Yes… That’s… good enough for me… ”
He smiles and closes his eyes, as if it’s enough.
“As expected… you… are going to be a… giant……”
“What are you saying? You said I was already a giant earlier……”
“…….”
There was no reply.
There never would be, no matter how long I waited.
So…….
Swoosh.
I stand up.
What happened while I was unconscious?
Many lie dead, both allies and enemies. 
Some are crushed under ice shards and rocks, and a giant monster lies fallen in a corner of the clearing.
The air is thick with the smell of death.
Only six of us are standing. 
Kak-!
The bald-headed boxer named Repeles and Amelia, who is fighting against him.
“Bagos-nim! The Barbarian is awake!”
A mage from the Noark rear guard.
And then…….
“Don’t look, kill that bitch first…!”
The Dragon Slayer wielding his sword.
Erwen, with a battered body, is fighting against him, armed only with a dagger.
“Ah, Barbarian……”
It seemed she had noticed I was awake, hearing the mage’s shouts.  Erwen turned her head.
It wasn’t a good idea.
Looking away during a battle was practically suicidal.
[Kail Elbad Geneger has used [Ground Thorn].]
A black spear shoots out from the mage’s hand.
That was the 2nd Grade skill that had instantly killed Might Million in Deadwood while he was casting Mess Teleport.
“……!”
Erwen’s pupils widen as she realizes the ambush.
At the same time, the mind of a warrior who has experienced countless battles understands clearly. 
Erwen can’t dodge that.
It’s not some grand premonition of the future, but the kind of thing you just know as surely as you know a person will fly when hit by a truck.
Huuung-!
Time slows down.
Swoosh.
// Main chara was confused with Erwen, needs fix.
Her ankles bend as she takes a running stance.
But…….
“…….”
Her body stiffens.
Why?
She’s ready to dash out at any moment.
Thump-
It feels like something invisible is holding onto her ankles. 
Her heart sinks coldly.
Even though she knows she shouldn’t, her mind thinks.
‘If I block that……’
Can she endure it?
There’s definitely going to be recoil.
Could she die from a single hit in her current condition?  Due to the extreme stress, a voice suddenly plays in her head.
[If you have to kill to survive, and it’s someone who has done nothing wrong.]
It was the voice of Hans A, whom she had recently reunited with.
[Or, if it’s a comrade you wanted to protect more than anything.]
Maybe Hans A was right.
She’s already looking for a reason to live.
[What would you do then?]
After all, what would happen to Aldidi if she died?
What about Jun?  What about the other members?
They all sacrificed themselves to get here.
So… she can’t be any different.
She has to make a cold judgment and move towards the path that’s best for everyone.
But…….
Ziiiiip.
So she should just watch Erwen die?
What would happen to Daria then?  The woman who had asked her to be her protector before dying?
Click.
Her head is in turmoil. 
How did she end up like this?
Right and wrong are unclear, making choices even harder.  It’s like a ball of yarn that has been messed up beyond repair.
Clench.
It tightens around her throat.
But…….
‘So what.’
Damn it, she doesn’t know anymore.
She’ll just do what she wants.
So…….
[As expected… you… are going to be a… giant…….]
She’s sorry to Aldidi, who believed in her until the end.
But she’s a Barbarian now.
And if she’s the giant Aldidi spoke of.
‘She wouldn’t hold back just to be safe.’
She pushes forward, gathering strength in her feet.
Her hesitation was a lie, and she moves forward in an instant. 
Swoosh.
A gust of wind blows.
“……!”
“……!”
Erwen and she lock eyes.
To her left, the Dragon Slayer looks surprised.
Kak-!
Amelia is too busy fighting.
At that moment.
Huuung-!
A sharp black spear flies towards her. 
But her mind is surprisingly calm as she watches it approach.
It’s not that she’s given up.
If she just focuses and avoids the vital points, her body can definitely withstand one hit—
[Erwen Fornachi di Tersia has used [Spirit Transformation].]
…Huh?
[Erwen Fornachi di Tersia proposes a ‘contract’ with the character.]
A familiar sensation begins to flow through her skin as she touches Erwen.
