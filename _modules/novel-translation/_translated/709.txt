## Chapter 709: The Summons (4)
I arrived in the Imperial City, Carnon, via a military magic circle, leaving the 7th District's wall garrison behind.  A group of knights was waiting for me, their presence causing a slight surprise.
"We've come to escort you, Baron Jandel."
Was this because of the war?  These weren't ordinary soldiers, but those haughty Royal Knights, offering me an escort.
"Please, enter the carriage."
Under the escort of the Royal Knights, I rode in the carriage towards the "Palace of Glory," a place I had already visited several times for the award ceremony, the welcoming feast, and the knighting ceremony.
'The war atmosphere is palpable.'
The Palace of Glory was unlike its usual self.  Not just the mood, but truly everything.
"Baron Bjorn Jandel's identity has been confirmed."
Even the identity check conducted upon entering the palace was more meticulous than usual. As I crossed the gate, a military encampment was clearly visible in the vast open space within.
Ah, of course, it differed from ordinary encampments.
'It feels like only officers are gathered here.'
As this wasn't the front lines, communication facilities were strategically positioned, manned by soldiers who seemed more adept with a pen than a sword. They were engaged in intense discussions, their faces serious, with a map laid out before them.
"The Command Center is this way."
Guided by the knights, I stepped into the Palace of Glory, finally recognizing familiar faces scattered throughout. Count Perdehilte, Viscount Mülbark, Count Alminus… 
Their greetings from afar filled me with an unfamiliar feeling. These people, it seemed, were now more familiar and frequently seen than the knights, officers, guild leaders, or high-ranking officials.
'Come to think of it, my first encounter with Count Perdehilte was at a banquet...'
There, I, as a Barbarian warrior, engaged in a fierce battle with the knights, ultimately earning the title "Knight Breaker" and the "Garphas Necklace" as spoils of war.
'That feels like ages ago...'
I was now a titled nobleman, exempt from ordinary law and subject only to the "Nobleman's Code."  As an adventurer and chieftain, I led one of the six races inhabiting this city.
But why?
'It feels like those days were the most enjoyable...'
Conquering the 6th tier monsters, witnessing the constant magic overload on the 3rd floor, and the tense exchanges with adventurers encountered in the labyrinth - those days, when I fought for daily survival.
Those days come to mind when I feel mentally drained.
Others might see it differently, judging by my improved circumstances and social standing, but…
“As the Commander-in-Chief is currently holding a meeting, would you please wait here for a while? You are free to move around anywhere within the military command center.”
“Sure.”
With those words, the knight who had guided me left.  I planned to assess the situation by observing my surroundings, but...
"Where did you train for so long?"
A familiar voice approached me, a smiling white-haired woman in upper-class attire.
“Ah, Baroness Lilibia.”
A member of the Melbes Interracial Noble Alliance and, among them, the most amicable to me. 
The "Rabbit Baroness," as she was known.
"You're going to get even stronger than that?"
As we had a close relationship, she joked playfully instead of offering a formal greeting.  I chuckled in response.
“How have you been?”
“Fine, before this whole thing happened.”
“Is that so? Anyway, it's good to see you. What’s the situation now? Is there anything I need to know?”
My question was a bit abrupt, and she seemed to ponder for a moment.
“Hmm, I’m not sure how to put this… Baron Jandel, what do you already know?”
“I came in a hurry so I don't know much. Just think of it as if I know nothing and tell me everything.”
At my request, she explained the current situation, from beginning to end.  The only new information I gained from her was...
“They infiltrated the Imperial City…?”
“Not the main force, but a small, elite unit.”
On the day the barrier surrounding Bifron collapsed, the Noark, having escaped, formed a special unit and penetrated the Imperial City.
However, there was little damage, and only a reconnaissance unit spotted them once before they disappeared without a trace.
“Didn't you see it while coming here?  Soldiers are deployed all over the city.”
Hmm, I did see the soldiers.  But I thought they were just for defense.
"We don't know their objective for infiltrating, but so far, there hasn’t been any significant damage found.”
In short, it means there is a possibility that the Noark’s special unit that infiltrated Carnon is still hiding somewhere inside.
“Don’t worry too much, though.  With that number, they wouldn't even dream of entering the royal palace.  This place is safe.”
She seemed to genuinely believe this.  It wasn’t an unreasonable belief when you consider the troops stationed at the palace - a special unit of thirty wouldn’t last more than a few minutes against them.  However...
'Don’t underestimate those bastards...'
Not knowing their motive for infiltrating makes me uneasy. Therefore...
'I should consider the royal palace not entirely safe.'
I finished my mental preparation there.  Listening to her story, I learned more new information.
Baroness Lilibia, after all, was a titled nobleman.  Naturally, she knew a lot of classified information that ordinary people wouldn't have access to.
"We managed to drive them back to Bifron using magical weaponry, but the Command Center predicts they might have used that opportunity to plant spies.”
The royal family, fearing spies, is conducting a widespread search in several districts currently housing refugees.
“Rumor has it that the Command Center is planning to launch a full-scale offensive to wipe them out in Bifron soon.”
She also gave me information about the future battle situation.
“Your clan is currently in the 7th District, right? If things go as planned, there might be casualties there too.”
She even muttered something I wouldn’t want to hear.
“…What do you mean?”
“This is… a secret you must keep to yourself?”
"Of course.”
Baroness Lilibia, who had already silenced me before we started talking, glanced around cautiously and whispered to me, her voice barely audible.
“The royal family believes that the adventurers’ power has become too strong, regardless of the Noark invasion.”
“…..What?”
“Don’t you see? As the war in the 7th Floor Dark Continent drags on, the adventurers are growing significantly stronger.”
Ah, that's what she meant.  It makes sense, though… the royal family had to provide ‘rewards’ to the adventurers throughout the war.
To survive this tumultuous era, smaller clans merged to form larger forces.  They joined the war like mercenary groups, rapidly growing stronger through their own acquired essence and equipment.
“So, the labyrinth closure was not solely to counter the Noark.”
“Yes.  No one knows the royal family's official stance, but everyone secretly suspects that.”
“But why is the royal family suppressing the adventurers?”
I voiced my longstanding question, and the Rabbit Baroness replied.
“Isn’t it obvious?  Whenever a force grows strong, its voice becomes louder.  They demand more and their greed always breeds bloodshed.  To rule this city, absolute power is necessary.”
Politically, it makes sense.  But something tells me there is more to it than that.
The adventurers growing strong and raising their voices.
Based on my experience, it feels like they are not so much suppressing this as they are wary of the adventurers’ growth itself.
’As if they are trying to prevent them from reaching the depths of the labyrinth…'
My thoughts were flowing smoothly until they reached that point.
Thump.
Wait a second.
“......”
If what I just thought was true…
“Look, there's Baron Jandel.”
“His clan's arrival on the front lines means the Baron is here.”
“Good, good.  Though their numbers are small compared to major clans, each of them is a match for a hundred, wouldn't you say?”
"They say that if a 10th Floor adventurer appears after a thousand years, it will be Baron Jandel and his comrades.”
Wait, is my clan the most dangerous?
***
The 3rd Command Center, a makeshift headquarters built in the largest building near the 7th District wall.
Knock, knock.
A knight with a rigid expression entered the room after knocking.
"Commander, an urgent report from the Command Center has arrived."
“Speak.”
The man seated at the desk with a large map before him gave permission for the knight to speak. He began his report in a slow, measured tone.
"The first order is regarding the Bifron extermination operation.  The security clearance is too high for me to access the documents, so the Commander will have to review them personally.”
“Understood. And the second?”
“Baron Jandel has arrived at the Command Center.”
“...... I see.”
The man, receiving the report from his subordinate, seemed lost in thought for a moment before accepting the document and dismissing the knight.  Then…
Swoosh.
He tore open the sealed document and checked its contents. 
Extermination date, time, troop deployment diagram…
Valuable information in wartime, absolutely vital and never to be given to the enemy.
As he read the detailed items, he froze upon reaching the troop deployment diagram.
'They're sending them to their deaths.'
The army's elite are deployed in the rear, while the adventurer forces are stationed at the most dangerous front lines.
The deployment diagram clearly indicates their intent.
An even more chilling single-line sentence was added at the very end of the document.
[Baron Bjorn Jandel has been incorporated into the Command Center as of this moment.  Please be informed that there are absolutely no plans for any future changes in his affiliation.]
There was no need to ponder their motives or hidden meanings anymore.
“Whew...”
He lowered the document and let out a long sigh.
[Do your job well.]
[…….]
[There will be no second chance.]
The chilling words of the barbarian echoed in his ears. Despite that...
"I don't like this.”
The order from above made him uncomfortable.  After all, he was just a human.
’What the hell is the royal family thinking…’
He lowered the document in displeasure and called back the subordinate who had left earlier.
“It’s a troop deployment diagram from higher-ups.  Quietly inform only the senior officers of each unit.”
“I, this…”
The subordinate, having seen the contents, also stammered.
He could understand his feelings.
The man himself was still unhappy with the contents of the document.  However...
“It's an order from higher-ups, so I won’t allow any dissent.”
You can’t just do whatever you want in this city to survive.
“…Nia Rapdonia!”
He wasn't a barbarian.
