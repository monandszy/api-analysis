The Guide (2)
Unlike the comforting confines of the wardrobe, the street felt ominous, heavy with the foreboding of impending doom.  I ran, and I ran again, carrying three people: Lilith Malone, a woman whose name I’d only just learned; the woman she was with; and the child, remarkably composed, who didn't cry despite the terrifying circumstances.
Thud-thud-thud—
As I ran, my mind far from clearing, became cluttered with a variety of thoughts, surprisingly small and trivial.  My arms were restricted, making running awkward. My back ached from being confined in the wardrobe for so long.  I craved the cool, sweet taste of strawberries from the refrigerator.  Why did our Goddess not grant her holy knights movement-enhancing abilities?
"If only I had [Enlargement]," I mused.  Then I could have perched two or three people on my shoulders and run far more easily. They say there are many extraordinary abilities among the Chosen, don't they?  Envy surged, but it was pointless. Those possessing 'Divine Power,' unlike mages, cannot etch other souls into their own.
"What is the principle behind it?" I wondered. The Order claimed our souls belonged to the Goddess, precluding the imprint of other souls.  As if I'd believe such nonsense.
"Quiet, everyone," Sven Parav whispered, halting their frantic run.  Quickly, they sought cover among the buildings. The situation was straightforward: they were less than five minutes from the fire in the east.
"It seems the Royal Guard and the Noirk forces are engaged in combat," Lilith Malone observed.
"Perhaps we should seek an alternate route?  Going around might be safer," the other woman suggested.
"To reach the East Branch, as Madam suggested, traversing this area is the quickest way," I said.  Going around would take at least three times longer, and I worried about finding a clear path amidst the surrounding flames.
"The tide of battle hasn't turned decisively yet; perhaps we can slip through quickly," Lilith Malone proposed.
Sven Parav considered her words, then nodded.  "Yes.  It's somewhat risky, but considering all factors, it seems the safest option."
And so, their strategy was finalized.
"Whew..." Sven Parav exhaled deeply, then emerged from the alleyway and sprinted toward the heart of the battle.  Their hands were already occupied, holding the others.
"Please, look after them..." I pleaded, leaving their defense entirely to Lilith Malone.  Relying on someone else's skill felt intensely unnerving, but there was no alternative.  I even considered closing my eyes and running blindly...
'But even for me, that would be going too far,' I thought.
Sven Parav kept their eyes fixed forward, heading into the maelstrom of blood and fire.
"...Who are they?"
"Are they the enemy?"
Initially, both sides hesitated to attack, unsure if the newcomers were friend or foe. But this hesitation was short-lived.
"Lilith Malone!"
"Sven Parav!"
"Yandel's companions!"
"Kill them!"
The Noirk forces identified them, launching an attack, while the Royal Guard— enthusiastically— provided support.
"Yandel's allies!  The Royal Family is clearly up to something! We must kill them here!"
"...Their relentless assault suggests a compelling reason! The entire army must protect them with all their might!"
Their plan had been to slip through the chaos; this development was entirely unexpected.  But...
'It's plus or minus zero; does it matter?'
Therefore, I decided to ignore it, concentrating solely on forging a path through the battle.
*BOOM!*
"Aaargh!"
*THWACK!*
A Royal mage intercepted an incoming spell; a soldier deflected a blade aimed at their stomach.  Despite their efforts, Lilith Malone barely managed to absorb an unstoppable attack with a magical barrier. A succession of perilous moments unfolded in rapid succession. However...
*WHOOSH!*
They successfully navigated the battlefield and reached the burning East District. The battle between those who sought to kill and those who sought to protect continued behind them, but...
'They won't follow into the flames.'
[Sven Parav cast [Prayer of Protection].]
Sven Parav, as planned, cast the sacred spell.  They quickly confirmed a thick barrier enveloping them all, then stepped into the flames.
"...What?"
"Why there...?"
The enemy and allies alike murmured, somewhat perplexed by their actions.
*WHOOSH!*
Sven Parav immediately resumed running. Visibility was poor due to the smoke and flames, but the path was straightforward, posing no major difficulties.
After some time...
"There!"
The East Branch of the Leatras Order, their destination, was visible in the distance.  Sven Parav saw the familiar statue of the Goddess at the entrance of the small temple.  Was her husband, the explorer, telling the truth?  Amidst the burning and collapsing city, the temple remained intact.
*WHOOSH!*
A shimmering, translucent barrier deflected the flames, preventing anyone from approaching the building. Entering the barrier, Sven Parav pushed open the entrance gate; it swung open easily, unlocked. Astonishingly...
"...Wh-who are you?"
The temple held people— a significant number of them.
"How did you manage to traverse these flames...?"
"Y-you're not Noirk..."
"Stay close behind me."
Refugees retreated, casting wary glances as Sven Parav appeared.
'One, two, three, four, five, six...'
There were thirty-seven refugees in total.  It wasn't unusual to find people fleeing the fire and fighting. They had come to this place, believing it safe. But the problem was...
"Mama..."
"It's, it's alright... Everything will be fine..."
Sven Parav instinctively felt it: this place wasn't safe either.
***
"Huh? Ah! The chieftain! I saw him near the woods! He was supposedly pretending to be a corpse and smashing the heads of the dead!"
"I see. But isn't this whole place the woods...?"
"What do you think you're hearing? Over there! The woods over there!"
"I... I'm rather busy, could you please deliver this to Mr. Yandel?  All the enemies within the sanctuary have been eliminated, so please come here."
"Understood!!"
A warrior in his late twenties, his face hardened, turned and sprinted back the way he came.
'Such a rugged face, yet so pure and simple-minded...'
A faint smile played on Bersil Goulard's lips.  She swiftly began clearing the battlefield.  Only one battle had been fought, but there was still so much to do.  They needed to guard against a renewed attack, and the piles of corpses needed to be cleared; left like this, they would soon stink.
"That's not a Noirk soldier! Throw him anywhere!"
"It's hard to tell them apart!"
"Hmph... We'll check if they are Noirks. You guys only handle the Barbarians!"
"Oh, good!"
Though she didn't give detailed instructions, her work became increasingly efficient over time.  The treatment of the corpses was extreme: Allied soldiers were treated respectfully, while enemy corpses were tossed aside, forming a mountain of the dead.
"Goulard... I mean, Vice-Captain.  What shall we do with the Noirks' bodies? We have collected the spoils of war and piled them as instructed, but..."
Kailslan's question drew a curt response from Bersil.
"Burn them all.  We're not going to make graves for those we don't even know."
"What about the belongings found on the warriors and explorers?  What will you do with those?"
"Store them neatly beside the corpses.  I will cast a preservation spell once the collection is complete.  Once identities are confirmed, we'll return them to their families.  Please ensure no one touches them."
"...That won't happen, but I will still reinforce caution."
Standing atop the walls, surveying the clearing below, she involuntarily chuckled bitterly. The stark contrast between the fates of the corpses was glaring from above, and she again realized why victory was essential in war. If the Noirks had won, it would have been the other way around.
"Behel—LAAAAAAAA!"
"Behel—LAAAAAAAA!"
A commotion erupted below.  Its source was obvious.
"The strongest warrior on the surface!!!"
"The guardian of the sanctuary has arrived!!"
Only one person was worthy of such reverence.
"Chieftain!!  The chieftain has arrived!!!"
Bersil entrusted wall defense to James Kala, who possessed the keenest eyesight among them, and descended.
"Uncle... are you sure you're not hurt anywhere? I was so worried..."
"I'm fine. And I'm the same."
"...Really?"
"Huh? Of course."
"Hehe... Of, of course it would... wouldn't it...?"
Erwenn, overjoyed at their reunion, clung to Yandel, who looked somewhat weary.
"...You've worked hard."
"Ah, you too. It must have been a difficult position."
The brief words of encouragement went unanswered.  She felt the weight of those words— 'difficult position.' While this wasn't her first time serving as Vice-Captain, this was different.  There was no war before, and the bonds between the clan members were not this strong.
'This person does this every day.'
It struck her, how much hardship this seemingly simple barbarian had overcome.
"I'd like to hear all about the situation."
"Ah, yes."
Bersil calmly explained what had happened, though her emotions inevitably seeped into her narrative. At times she complained, at others her voice was laced with sorrow, like a child recounting a bad day at school.
"I see."
The barbarian took a moment to gather his thoughts, then issued orders as if it were the most natural thing in the world.
"Bersil, gather the clan. I have something to say."
To her surprise, a strong sense of relief washed over her—unusual for her proactive nature. Was it so peaceful to avoid responsibility and simply follow orders?
"I'll gather them right away."
She obeyed without question.  Only later did she inquire about the reason for the gathering.
"But what do you want to say...?"
"I just want to go fight together. I heard you're quite skilled, right?"
"My skill... but they'll want to stay safe here."
Bersil spoke cautiously, but the barbarian chuckled, as if dismissing her concerns.
"Ah, that? Don't worry about that."
He patted her shoulder encouragingly, then stepped forward.
"Glad to meet you. You stayed in our sanctuary, following our Vice-Captain while I was gone, right?"
"Yes? Ah, yes... Thank you, Baron Yandel."
"Yes, you should be thankful. If you're human."
He completely ignored their service in defending the sanctuary and only mentioned the kindness they had been shown.  He continued:
"The reason I've summoned you is simple."
"What is it?"
"Ah, nothing much, I'm about to go to war, and I'd like your help."
"...Us?"
The title of Baron, the reputation of a giant.  Though intimidated, their eyes conveyed the unspoken question: 'Why should we?'  He was experienced, though.
"Yes, or will you be banished from the sanctuary?"
A whiplash delivered without ceremony—the freedom of a barbarian.
"...Banishment for refusing an order? What kind of threat is that?"
"Wicked rebels started a war, and you only care about your own safety? Is that what a loyal citizen of Raphdonia would do?"
"..."
The mention of the Royal Family silenced the explorers. What came next was even more astonishing.
"Don't worry too much. This is a chance to gain merit."
"Merit...? What do you mean...?"
As soon as 'profit' was mentioned, the explorers' eyes lit up.
"You've been cooped up here, but in District 5, at my request, the army has advanced into District 7.  The army is pushing from the north."
"..."
"And on my way here, I set some fires, so there's a firestorm in the east as well. They're already in chaos, and now we from the south attack upwards?"
"...It will create a siege!"
"Yes, why did they retreat with all these troops? Did they really retreat just because you broke down the walls? No. Chaos erupted behind them, forcing them to prioritize more urgent matters!"
"Ah...! I understand now...!"
"I had questions too, now I understand!"
The barbarian, having boldly used the whip, now offered the carrot.  The explorers listened, captivated. Their surrender was swift.
"Therefore, I'm about to lead all available forces to District 7..."
Bersil Goulard's jaw dropped.  The sight before her was unbelievable.
'...Is this the same person?'
When she was Vice-Captain, people had been focused on escaping rather than defending the sanctuary. Now, everyone's eyes gleamed.
"Anyone who wants out?"
He seemed to not even consider failure.
