## The Third Record (4)
Her hair was a tangled mess, covering her face like a wig. A single eye glinted from amidst the chaos.
*BOOM!*
She stood at least six meters tall.  Though she was already well beyond the size of a giant beast, her absurdly long arms made her seem even larger.  Of course, she was still smaller than the Hipra Mammoth.
*BOOM!*
Despite this, the pressure she exerted was on a whole other level.  After all, I knew more about this creature than anyone else.
The Silent Sovereign, Siliath.  The tyrannical ruler of the fifth floor, armed with intricate, treacherous mechanisms. A true bane to my existence as an explorer who wielded essence. It was impossible to counter her essence with a 'Solidarity' spell like I did against the 'traitor' Ricardo Ruhenpraha, who had once possessed her essence... 
*Why is she here?*
Despite my bewilderment, my actions were immediate. 
*Thud, thud.*
The moment our eyes met, I retreated, pulling Erwen into an embrace.  And then... 
"...!"
Instead of speaking, I used hand signals to issue simple instructions to the wizard Kahyun, who happened to catch my eye. 
*Attack.*
*With utmost ferocity.*
If they were members of the Clan Anabada, I could have issued more complex instructions through hand signals. But this was a part of the game that simply wouldn't change.
Fortunately, Kahyun acted upon the instructions without hesitation.
"Kahyun Besilus has cast the ancient spell [Katooka's Thunderstorm]."
Katooka's Thunderstorm. One of the ancient spells Kahyun, the 'Wizard', was able to use. A spell that requires no casting time and takes effect instantly.  Naturally, its power was anything but lacking.
*Flash!*
A series of blinding flashes, as if the heavens were collapsing, engulfed the entire canyon. 
*WHOOOOOM!*
A powerful vibration, rather than a sound, resonated through my skin.  Simultaneously, a message appeared.
"The character has left the range of [Speechless Curse]."
The Silent Sovereign, Siliath, who had been climbing the cliff, fell to the ground below, and the world came back into focus.
"Whoa... " Kahyun was a bit dazed, having cast the spell without a second thought.
"Hmm, a fascinating beast." The village chief remained unconcerned.  Now that I think about it, did this old man even have to face floor bosses during his time? According to the records engraved on the Stone of Honor, floor bosses started appearing in the dungeon after Rimeinin, the Deep Seeker, reached the tenth floor.
"Sir Besilus, do you know anything about the nature of this creature?"
"If I saw correctly, the, the monster we just saw is a floor boss of the Great Wilderness... "
"Floor boss... ?" The village chief tilted his head, as if the term was unfamiliar.  But there was no time for explanations.
"Move! All of you! Follow me!"
We had to get out of there. Even if we had to face her someday, the narrow canyon was not an ideal place to fight.  I needed time to process the situation.
"Erwen, hold tight."
"Yes, yes!"
I quickly moved forward, still holding Erwen close.
*Thud, thud.*
As I began to run, I noticed another change. While I had been trying to push through the monsters, I had to admit... 
*A blessing in disguise...*
Perhaps due to the Silent Sovereign's appearance, the monsters blocking our path had disappeared without a trace.
"Baron, please tell us where you're going!"
"Down."
"Down…? But the floor boss will be waiting down there!"
"Exactly why we're going there. It's more advantageous to fight her on a flat surface than in a canyon."
"Are you… are you really thinking of fighting her?"
Kahyun yelled in disbelief, but all I could offer was a single response.
"Do we have a choice?"
"Damn it, a floor boss! You need hundreds of people prepared to take her down, and even then there'll be casualties. You think five people will manage to take her on? Especially with that fairy who can't even contribute a single ounce of strength in this situation?"
It wasn't an unreasonable reaction. The floor bosses were notorious.  And his agitated speech… well, I guess it was due to the field effect.  I didn't have time for Hammer Cure this time, so I decided to simply let it slide—
"Kahyun Besilus!" 
The village chief's roar echoed through the canyon.  I had never heard him shout like that before.
"Y-Yes…? "
Seeing Kahyun completely stunned, the village chief spoke with a firm voice.
"Stop grumbling and follow the Baron's orders. This is an order."
"Yes, but… "
"Are you refusing to obey?"
"N-No… I just think there must be another way besides fighting her—."
"Answer with 'yes' or 'no' only. But be careful. Your answer today will decide your future."
"... I will obey."
Thankfully, the village chief stepped in at the right moment, and the situation quickly calmed down. When leadership falters in situations like these, there's no hope.  It seemed the village chief knew that as well. 
*Thud, thud.*
The village chief soon caught up to me, who had been at the forefront, and walked beside me.
"Judging by the way that fellow reacted, this enemy seems quite formidable. Are you sure you have a plan?"
"... Of course I do."
To be precise, I'm still in the midst of formulating one. 
But regardless, it's not a situation to despair over yet.  We already have the necessary components for a raid.
*Priest, Wizard, Knight.*
The most important human resources when raiding a Silent Sovereign.  Of course, five people is far too small a number to take her down...
Unlimited divine power, ancient magic.  The village chief, thanks to his inflated stats, has been showcasing his overwhelming might throughout this chapter.  This meets the bare minimum requirements.
*The problem is me and Erwen…*
But let's think positively. It's highly likely we'll have a 'role' to play in the raid. After all, that's what [Dungeon & Stone] is all about. 
*Once the boss fight starts, I'll have to keep an eye on the situation while the three of them take on the raid.*
The most important figure here is the priest. With unlimited divine power, if used effectively, we can potentially hold out—
"I, man, man, man, man—!! Stop right there!!"
A commotion erupted behind us.
I halted, turning around, and saw Kahyun and the Archbishop frozen in their tracks. 
Or more accurately… 
"The Archbishop has suddenly stopped moving!"
Kahyun looked at the Archbishop, who was frozen like he was possessed, with a worried expression.
"Step aside for a moment."
I set Erwen down and approached to check the situation. The Archbishop was simply staring blankly at the void. 
Something was clearly wrong.
*What's going on?*
The Silent Sovereign doesn't have this kind of pattern.  Is it because we're in a rift?  If that's the case, it means too many variables...
"Baron."
Suddenly, the Archbishop opened his mouth. 
*Wow, that startled me...*
While I secretly soothed my startled heart, I calmly continued to assess the situation. 
"Archbishop, are you alright? What was that all about?"
If there's a problem, we need to figure out a solution quickly—
"Don't worry. I'm fine. In fact, I'm better than ever."
What in the world?
"... What do you mean?"
"Exactly what I said. The grace of God fills my entire being. I've never felt so fulfilled in my life..."
Judging by the way his eyes were gleaming, the Archbishop was still out of his mind. 
Damn it, we don't have time for this.
"Baron."
As I pondered what to do with the Archbishop, he turned his gaze towards me.
"Baron, would you ever consider worshipping something other than your ancestral spirits?"
Those were the very words the Silent Sovereign spoke to me before she appeared.  But this time, there was a sense of unease in his words the moment I heard them.
I'm not sure, but…
"I'm just asking, just in case."
I had to check.
"Is the 'something else' you're talking about Reatlas?"
The Archbishop remained silent.  But as if to answer my question instead… 
*SWOOSH-SWOOSH-SWOOSH-SWOOSH*
Thousands of black particles rose from the dungeon's darkness and gathered around the Archbishop, like a blessing bestowed upon him. 
Unfortunately, I know what this effect means.  The effect that appears when someone chooses to become a priest of Karui.
*SWOOSH-SWOOSH-SWOOSH-SWOOSH*
The Archbishop smiled brightly and extended his hand toward the black particles.
There was no point in denying it anymore.  It was so sudden, so unbelievable.
"Do you see? God's grace?"
The Archbishop had become a priest of Karui. 
***
"Eden Hestaya has succumbed to temptation."
"You can now use the power of Karui."
***
My head felt numb.  Our team's priest had suddenly become a priest of Karui. 
What should we do?
*Should I kill him now?*
Considering his defenseless state, it might not be entirely impossible.  No, there won't be another opportunity like this. 
I needed to make a decision quickly.  If the Archbishop, with his unlimited divine power, turned against us after becoming a priest of Karui, it would be a disaster.
*But... if I kill him, will I have an answer then?*
Setting aside the moral question of whether or not it's right to kill him so easily...
Without a priest, we can't defeat the floor boss.
My mind raced. 
*Maybe I shouldn't kill him.*
I still don't know how to conquer this rift.  But what if the Archbishop, after becoming a priest of Karui, plays a crucial role?
An impulsive decision could lead to irreversible consequences—
"The character has cast [Swing]."
When I regained my senses, my hammer was already swinging towards the Archbishop's temple. Not a carefully considered decision, but a momentary judgment.
*CRACK!*
With a single, powerful swing, half of the Archbishop's head flew off.
But he was still standing. I knew Karui's priests were capable of Half Head Mode, so it wasn't surprising.
"Wh-What… what are you doing!?"
Kahyun's reaction was different from the Archbishop's.
"Y-You're attacking the Archbishop! Have you gone mad!?"
Ah. He just doesn't know what's going on right now.
There was no time for explanations.
*One more time.*
I swung my hammer, but it was blocked by the tentacles that had sprouted from the Archbishop's body.  It looked more like a disgusting, horrifying sight than a divine spell.
"... W-What in the world is going on?"
I tried to swing my hammer a few more times, but the tentacles kept countering.  I finally gave up and gave a brief explanation.
"The Archbishop has become a priest of Karui."
"What?"
"Look. His head's half gone, but he's still alive."
"Th-Then we have to kill him quickly!"
Oh, so you're yelling at the Archbishop now.  A moment ago, you were shouting about what a terrible thing I was doing.
"Count Saintred, will you take care of it?"
After quickly issuing the order, the village chief, without any objections, drew his aura and swung his sword.
But… 
*BOOM!*
That shell deflected even the aura.  Yet, the village chief didn't seem disappointed at all.
"I think I could manage if I went all out... But then you'd have to treat me as a non-existent person afterward. It's a kind of finishing move.  Do you want me to do that?"
The village chief stared at me, as if the decision was entirely up to me.  My worries deepened.
If the village chief also disappears, we'll only have the wizard left.  I need to consider the consequences—
"You all..."
Suddenly, the Archbishop opened his mouth. 
"You still don't understand me at all."
His voice lacked any emotion, like the village chief's old voice. 
"Don't worry. You will soon."
As soon as the Archbishop's ominous statement ended…
As if he was receiving a ritual to exorcise spirits, his spine snapped backwards, and his chest burst open.
*KAKAKAKAKAK*
I recognized the skill the moment I saw it.
"Eden Hestaya has cast [Unstable Vessel]."
Unstable Vessel.  The ultimate finishing move of Karui's priests.  The skill is simple.
It makes you invincible for a short time...
*And then it explodes.*
It's the most powerful skill in [Dungeon & Stone],  in terms of range and power, no other skill can even compare.
*It's too late to avoid it.*
I made a decision.  Even if I had to sacrifice the village chief, I had to stop this. 
I was about to speak, when…
*BOOM!*
The ground vibrated, and all sound disappeared.
"The character has entered the range of [Speechless Curse]."
"All essence skills are sealed."
As if things couldn't get any worse, the floor boss I had knocked off the cliff reappeared. 
*Attack.*
*With utmost ferocity.*
I frantically relayed the hand signals I had previously sent to Kahyun to the village chief.  But he shook his head and looked at me with a troubled expression.
Ah, maybe we can't have our essence sealed?
*Damn it.*
So I quickly changed the signal.
*Run for your life.*
*Anywhere.*
*Survive.*
This was the first time I had used the "every man for himself" signal in my long explorer career. 
The moment I confirmed that everyone understood the signals, I picked up Erwen and ran to the edge of the cliff.
But even in the midst of all this, I wasn't entirely sure.  Would we survive if we fell?
*But... it's better than getting hit by that skill.*
With that thought, I was about to launch myself into the abyss, when…
*BOOM!*
A giant hand appeared from below the cliff.  I was going to ignore it and jump, but the way the hand moved was a bit strange.  It wasn't trying to grab us…
*Whoa...*?
The creature had its upper body perched on the ledge, and it crouched down as if hugging the Archbishop.  Then...
"..."
It briefly met my eyes…
*Thud.*
It released the Archbishop, dropping him into the abyss, and then it loosened its grip on the ledge.
"The character has left the range of [Speechless Curse]."
About three seconds later, we were far enough away for [Speechless Curse] to deactivate.
How much time had passed?
*KAAAAAAAABOOOOOOOOOOOM!*
A blast, as if a nuclear bomb had detonated, erupted from below, and...
"Everyone! Hold on tight!!"
The Great Wilderness began to crumble.
