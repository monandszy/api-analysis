## The Butterfly (6)
She was an evil spirit, but had no memories of the other world.  Hearing this, I was reminded of the famous saying, "I drank, but I didn't drive." It made no sense at first, but then a bolt of lightning struck my mind.
"Could it be... you were revived using the Stone of Rebirth?"
If that were the case, it would explain everything. The Stone of Rebirth required several conditions to be met, but the biggest penalty was "memory deletion." I, too, had resurrected a comrade, but my bond with them reset to zero, causing them to leave the team, leaving me to wield only the Stone of Rebirth.
"The Stone of Rebirth...?"
What was this reaction?
"No matter what that means, I have nothing to do with the Stone of Rebirth."
"Then why don't you have any memories?"
Jeina's grip on her hand tightened at my question.
"I... offered all of my memories about the other world to Lord Karui. That's why I don't remember anything."
Oh, I see. 
I thought it was because of the Stone of Rebirth.  This is a little embarrassing.
'...So you can even offer memories.'
Thinking back to the time I played as Karui's priest, it wasn't completely inconceivable. Whenever every attempt failed, and the end was approaching, he would offer a proposition. He would revive me, but I had to pay the price.
The price was always random, and the choices were remarkably varied.
My bond with all characters would drop to zero.
One of my possessed Essences would be taken.
There was even the option of losing a limb forever, or the death of another NPC comrade.
'The craziest one was, as the price for revival, I had to return to the city and become a wanted criminal.'
Trading with Karui was absolute. Even if the price was paid "afterwards," failure to keep the promise meant death for the character.
Anyway, that's not the point.
"It must have been a dire situation for you to offer your memories."
I murmured briefly, and Jeina made a strange expression.
"Yes... it must have been. Probably."
Hmm, this sounds like she's just making excuses. Should I ask more?
While I was contemplating whether or not to delve deeper, she unexpectedly spoke first.
"I paid the price twice that day. Once to move us all to a safe place... that's when I lost my memories of the real world."
"And?"
"The other time... I used it to save someone who was dying. In exchange, I lost all memories of 'that person.'"
"...Was it someone important?"
"I don't know for sure, but... it must have been. I paid that price."
"What happened to that person?"
"There's nothing left to happen. They died in the labyrinth soon after."
"...."
"Don't take it so seriously. I didn't feel anything, not even when they died right in front of me."
Hearing Jeina's calm voice made me understand why people called Karui a demon god.
"Then why are you with Baekho? Are you planning to go back to your world?"
"No, I'm not interested in that world. I have no memories of it. To me, this is reality, and the other world is just a dream."
The process was quite different, but in a way, her case was very similar to mine.
That's why, perhaps?
Initially, I just wanted to extract information, but I found myself increasingly curious about Jeina's story.
"I'm with Baekho for one reason."
"What?"
"I have to offer a vast amount of tribute to get my lost memories back."
"I see...."
As Jeina said, in "Dungeon & Stone," it wasn't impossible to regain the price paid to Karui. Permanent limb loss could also be restored.
If Karui deems the tribute sufficient, that is.
"Being with Baekho means I can easily get high-quality tribute, so I'm with him. That's the only reason."
Huh, I never thought she would have a story like this.  She said she wasn't interested in her modern memories, so it's clear what memories she's trying to regain.
But there's one thing I still don't understand.
"...Why are you trying to regain your memories so desperately?"
She has no memories of 'that person' anymore. She clearly stated she didn't feel anything when they died.
So why is she going through all this trouble?
"It's just... frustrating."
Jeina's answer was remarkably simple.
"I can't understand the words and expression that person had when they died that day. It's so frustrating and annoying. ...Why? Is that weird?"
"...No, not at all."
With that, Jeina's detection spell picked up the scent of a monster, and the conversation ended. We didn't discuss the topic any further.
But the story we had just shared kept replaying in my mind.
'An evil spirit who lost her memories...'
There are so many different stories in the world.

KWA-A-A-A-A-A-NG-!
Despite its characteristic of regular meteor showers, the primordial land had ever-changing weather.
And it always took the form of something brutal to humans.
"Ha... ha..."
This time it was a heatwave.
Or rather, I'm not sure if it could even be described as a heatwave.
HWA-L-L-U-K-!
Smoke began to rise from the living trees, unable to withstand the heat, and in severe cases, they even caught fire and burned fiercely.
Thanks to the Fire Orb, I had fire resistance and wouldn't suffer burns or ongoing damage. However, there was no way to deal with the heat. If we had a mage, I would ask them to turn on the AC.
"...We're surrounded."
"What are we going to do?"
"We can't run at our speed, so we have no choice but to fight."
Even though we avoided combat with monsters as much as possible, there were times when we had no choice but to fight.
A tank and a priest.
It wasn't a good combination for hunting monsters, but somehow we managed to survive.
That's because...
"Jeina Flyer casts [Rotten Wind]."
"Inflicts ongoing dark attribute damage on enemies within range and decreases physical resistance."
The priest wasn't your typical priest.
"The character casts [Swing]."
And I'm not your typical tank either.
KWA-JIK-!
We could handle anything up to Grade 4.
Well, it's slow, but we can.
KU-U-UNG-!
"There's a Bartanous!"
"Get on!"
Anyway, we fought, but if we encountered a monster above Grade 3, we ran for our lives. As a tank and a priest, it wasn't impossible to take down a monster if we fought for hours, but that was only if we could fight them one-on-one. It wasn't worth taking hours to kill anyway.
'...Huh?'
Suddenly, I stopped in my tracks, and Jeina asked me why in a worried voice. I pointed to a spot with my hand instead of replying.
A roughly torn cloth was hanging from a tree. A trace of someone who had passed through this place before.
SWEEK.
I stretched out my hand and unfolded the cloth, revealing the words written on it.
"If you see this... ... , ... ang monument."
The middle part was burned black by the heatwave, making it impossible to read the contents, but I immediately understood what it meant.
"It says to go to the central monument of the primordial forest."
Baekho, the Destroyer, the Archer, and the GM. It seems like one of these four headed towards the central monument and left this message on the way.
"Why four...?"
"Do you think Aures would leave this?"
"Ah, I understand."
"In any case, if we go to the central monument, we'll meet one more person."
This was great news. 
Except for Aures, the rest were all dealers. Whoever it was, it would complete the deal, tank, and heal combination.  Then our stability and movement speed would increase considerably.
"Let's move quickly."
"Yes."
Knowing there was a chance we could miss each other, I moved at full speed. 
And...
One hour, two hours, three hours.  I pushed on without a moment's rest.
Then, a familiar voice rang out from thin air.
"...Me, Lord Baron?"
Damn, that startled me. I almost swung my hammer without thinking.
"...Havelion?"
I looked towards the source of the voice, and the GM's figure appeared as if his invisibility spell had worn off.  We met a comrade before we even reached our destination.
"Lord Baaarooonn!!!!"
The GM clung to me, but I casually moved aside to avoid his embrace and asked, "Did you tie the cloth on the tree?"
"Ah, no. I just found it recently and was following it!"
Hmm, I see.  Things are going smoothly.  This means there is another comrade waiting at the monument where the cloth was tied.  Two people suddenly becoming four.
"Lord Baron, what happened to you..."
"We're almost there, so let's talk when we get there."
I was curious about the GM's situation, but as we were close to our destination, I fully focused on moving, my senses wide open.
After about thirty minutes more, I saw the familiar monument buried in a crater.
But the problem was...
"Was that always there?"
"No way."
There was another structure where only the monument should have been. It was like only the doorway part of a temple had been removed and placed on bare ground.  There were stairs leading down, but it was too dark to see inside even when I got closer.
Also...
"The letters are red... that wasn't there before, was it?"
"Yes! I'm sure because I investigated the monument. That didn't exist before."
The first line of the topmost part of the monument, where undecipherable hieroglyphics were written, was glowing red.
What kind of situation was this?
I was utterly confused, but my biggest question was different.
"...But why is no one here?"
We came here following the message on the cloth, but no one was waiting for us.
"Let's wait a while. Maybe they went to tie more cloths in the area for a bit."
"Yes... then I'll investigate the monument. I'm sensing a different flow of magic..."
"I'll go check out that structure. I'm feeling a very familiar energy."
"Familiar energy?"
"It's hard to explain. Just think of it as an energy related to an ancient being."
"...Okay."
The two of them started their investigations, and I observed their progress while keeping an eye on the surroundings. 
And...
'Why isn't anyone coming?'
It was about three days when I started to wonder if waiting here was pointless.
"Good thing you're not too late."
The Destroyer appeared from afar, looking nonchalant. For a mage to wander around the ninth floor alone for more than three days, he seemed surprisingly unscathed.
'...Is he a mage who can solo?'
That was amazing, but before discussing his skills, I had to ask.
"Did you tie the cloth?"
"...Cloth?"
The Destroyer replied that he had never seen anything like that.
"I just came here thinking that if I was in the center, someone would come."
"So you also don't know who tied the cloth?"
"No, it was probably Baekho."
"How are you so sure?"
"Aures wouldn't do it, so there's only one person left."
"What? But it could have been Bryiet."
The GM tilted his head in confusion, and the Destroyer replied in a firm tone,
"Bryiet is dead."
