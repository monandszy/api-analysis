## The Age of Exploration (3)
After Butterfly finished her turn, the round table discussion continued.
"The one who created the cheat version of [Dungeon and Stone] is not Auril Gaviss, but another entity."
Once again, Wolf uttered information that could potentially alleviate the players' hostility towards him.
"How about this?  A mischievous smile.  In this exploration, Noirque successfully defeated the 8th floor layer lord."
Jester also safely transitioned his turn using information regarding Noirque's growing strength.
My turn came up.
"When you defeat the boss of Skull Island and reach the 10th floor, you can experience a special event."
With everyone's attention focused, I blandly stated one of the pieces of information I possessed, concluding my turn.
"... A special event. I'm very curious about it.  Of course, for that event to happen, this war needs to end first.  A mischievous smile."
Though it was rare for me to provide game information, the members didn't find it strange at all.
After all, the fact that I had received the green light for game information meant that it was valuable, unreleased information…
"Come on, let's all try harder this time!"
The members, who had been with me for a long time, thought that I was simply acting this way because the information for this turn was boring.
"Well, it's my turn again?"
With the Queen's turn starting a new round, I listened intently to the information shared, etching it into my memory.
Among them were several pieces of information that were quite shocking and stories that would be helpful in the future.
However, my focus was completely absent.
The reason was simple.
Misha Kalstain is a traitor.
And not just any traitor, she is a traitor from my perspective.
The words echoed in my mind like a resounding bell.
Two rounds have already passed.
Even now, as the third round is nearing its end, I continue to wonder:
"... What does it mean?"
Misha is a traitor?
Just when I thought she would finally open up to me and join forces, that two-faced bastard, Lee Baek-ho, has played another trick.
Could this be his Plan B?
All sorts of possibilities are swirling in my mind, yet remain unresolved.
"I need to hear more details."
It was Butterfly who mentioned this information.
However, unlike my expectations, there was no mention of Misha in the second or third rounds.
In other words, to hear more about it, I have to take action.
"A mischievous smile, why are you all so surprised?  Are you afraid of Noirque's progress, perhaps, Laphdonia?"
How can I bring up the topic naturally?
If I were to directly ask why Misha is a traitor, it would raise suspicion.
As someone who was once rumored to be the ‘Investigator, Bjorn Jandel’, I have to be cautious with every word—
"... ..."
"... ..."
Ah, it's my turn already.
I snapped out of my thoughts to find everyone's eyes focused on me in the middle of a strange silence.
"Just one more time, one more time. Let me observe."
I decided to act if there was still no mention of Misha in the next round, and then I opened my mouth.
"If you defeat the Heavenly Lord solo, you can choose an active effect."
It was one of those pieces of information that is hard to uncover, yet even if you know it, it's not something you'd use often.
Whistling wind.
Green light filled the room, causing a momentary silence at the round table.
Of course, it wasn't for long.
"Is it… possible to defeat a layer lord alone?"
"Well, if it's 100x mode, it might be… possible."
"A mischievous smile, do you think Investigator would defeat it in that mode and say that?"
As it was information related to the layer lord, there were no objections. No, to be honest, even if I were to use fermented soybean paste instead of miso, they would all assume it was an important secret and accept it as long as the green light flashed.
"So, is it the Queen's turn now?"
As I thought that, I glanced at the side.
"I think we've heard everything we need to for this month. Let's wrap it up here today."
The Queen announced her absence.
The other members followed suit, glancing at each other.
Unfortunately, the biggest reason for this was me.
"... Well, Investigator seems bored anyway."
I hadn't spoken much during the meeting, absorbed in my thoughts, and my turn had been filled with just game information. It seems I'd given them that impression.
"I'm sorry… It's a pity.  I thought you might enjoy hearing that I captured the Lord of Hope. A mischievous smile."
Jester seemed disappointed that he couldn't capture my attention even though he prepared a lot this time.
"Well… It's probably nothing for you, Investigator."
Jester, despite showing a bit of disappointment, promised me he would bring interesting stories next time.
Ugh, I can't encourage them to continue with another round in this atmosphere.
"... ..."
Eventually, the meeting ended.
***
The day after visiting the community.
After a good night's sleep and waking up in the afternoon, Bersil Goul land visited me and waited.
"What brings you here?"
While anticipating the reason for her visit, I pretended not to know. Bersil said she had something to say and asked for a private audience.
"I… I don't know how you'll take this… but I heard information that Misha Kalstain might be a traitor."
Ah, so she came to me as soon as she woke up because of this.
"A traitor?"
"... I'm not sure. Well, I'm sure it's true, but I don't know the details."
Bersil asked me what I thought about reconsidering Misha's joining the clan, but I firmly refused.
"I can't make that decision without knowing the full story."
"As expected… I see."
"But, I'm not going to pretend to be oblivious to your worries. I'll look into it as well. So, could you please investigate further?"
"... Okay. I'll find out more."
"I'll be counting on you."
Okay, this means that starting from the next round table, she'll be actively searching for information while wearing the Fox Mask...
I've reduced the risk of exposing myself by trying to probe first.
"I'll go now. Please call me anytime if you need anything."
"Alright."
After Bersil left, a letter arrived around evening.
"Dad! A strange letter came, and you need to check it!"
Erwen retrieved a letter from the mailbox.
The front had a picture of a white tiger, and the contents, already torn open, were written in characters that didn't exist in this world.
[I did what you asked for.]
What's he trying to do sending it in Korean?
What if other people see it?
Though I grumbled to myself, I diligently read the instructions on how to get out of the city.
"It's more complicated than I thought."
It seemed impossible to memorize and burn it in a short time, so I carefully folded it and put it in my subspace.
New options are always welcomed.
On the other hand, increasing variables is not.
It's better to be prepared, even if I don't want to believe it.
Therefore…
"Amelia, could you investigate Misha?"
"What do you mean?"
After explaining to Amelia what happened at the round table, I instructed her to investigate.
"I'll try, but keeping an eye on her all day has a high chance of getting caught.  She's not easy to deal with, as you saw."
"Really? Based on the essences she's eaten, you should be better at this kind of thing."
"If she's truly approached us with a hidden motive, she might be hiding other essences."
"... Then don't get too close to her yet. Just keep an eye on her for now."
"Alright."
Ugh, so Amelia will investigate Misha to the best of her ability, as long as she doesn't cross the line…
I spent the day resting, and from the next day, I continued my busy days.
I visited the Holy Ground to sell land again, and I visited the former tribal leader to hear about the previous tribal council, just in case I needed advice.
I also met Raven again.
"A recording stone…? Could you be talking about the recording shard stone? The legacy of Gabriilius."
"Whether it's a recording stone or a recording shard stone doesn't matter.  Give me any book or information related to either.  Don't try to find it too obviously, as it might attract unwanted attention."
"Yes. I will.  But, Jandel, how are the exploration preparations going?"
"Everything is going smoothly.  Of course, we'll know for sure once we enter the maze this time."
"Of course…  We don't know anything yet.  We really need to go on the exploration.  Bersil Goul land… how is that woman?"
"What do you mean?"
"What do you mean!  A mage is crucial for this kind of exploration.  Last time, I saw that she doesn't seem to know much about history."
"Well, it's alright. She's good at fighting, and I can trust her.  I'll fill in the gaps."
"Is that… so?"
After meeting with Raven, I gathered all the clan members three times a week.
The official purpose was to build cohesion between the new member Misha and the existing members before the exploration.
"... I haven't found anything unusual yet."
After each gathering, I always received a report from Amelia, but I still haven't found anything suspicious about Misha.
As time passed...
"... It will be a more prosperous exploration than ever before."
Melvess sent supplies.
Combat and support scrolls, various types of potions, exploration-specific number items, and more.
They sent a wide variety of goods, enough to continue the exploration no matter what kind of environment we faced, be it mountains, water, or fire.  The quality was also top-notch.
"This alone must have cost a fortune…"
It was a glimpse into how much Melvess was expecting from the ‘hidden area’.
It was a bit burdensome, but I thought that I would be satisfied with the results, so I continued to prepare for the exploration.
And now, as those days continued…
"Bjorn…"
"It's not Bjorn. It's Tribal Leader. The First Elder."
"Oh, right, Holy Ground? I'll be careful."
As the sun set and I walked through the dark forest of the Holy Ground, I saw a brightly lit clearing, along with dozens of young warriors.
I grinned and shouted.
"Congratulations, young warriors! From today, you will leave the Holy Ground and become true warriors!"
It seems…
"Behel—laaaaahhhh!!!"
There are no newbies this time.
***
Every day, the era evolves.
If we consider the history of Earth's humanity, it was the modern era.
The 200 years since the Industrial Revolution have been the most explosive period of development in human history.
What about the barbarians?
When will this tribe experience the most explosive development?
I can say with certainty:
"Now."
The proof is right here in this clearing.
The tutorial dialogue itself has changed.
"Now, one by one, come and choose the weapons and armor that suit you!"
Countless weapons and armor were displayed on the equipment stand.
And this is just the main course, the basic equipment provided has also been significantly improved.
"Come here. Leg guards aren't worn like that, they're worn like this."
"Ah, thank you… I've never worn this before."
Instead of just giving them a breastplate and sending them into the maze, we now provide all the additional armor.
Their bags are also filled with a compass, water bottle, potions, and various exploration tools.
"1 million stones per person."
The cost of equipping each warrior has essentially tripled, but it wasn't a problem.
Our Holy Ground generates money when we dig the ground.
"With this level of support, these kids will quickly grow and earn money to buy land."
It's still early, but if we continue like this, we will soon be able to complete the virtuous cycle I envisioned.
"Ugh… It's so tight…"
The young warriors were uncomfortable with the armor they had on, and although they insisted they didn't need it, they didn't resist.
Teenagers always have idols.
"Even if it's tight, endure it. You'll get used to it quickly."
"But…"
"It's not a choice!  If you're a warrior, you must wear armor! Don't you see it with Tribal Leader?"
"... ..."
"If you want to become a great warrior, wear armor!"
There were no longer any warriors in our tribe who looked down on armor.
"... I'll quickly earn money and buy a lightinium armor!"
My favorite lightinium, in particular, had become almost a symbol of seasoned warriors.
"Now, go!  To the place where your destiny awaits!"
After providing the basic equipment, I sent them all to the maze, grouping them into three with the help of Bersil, who had been waiting outside, and casting binding magic on them.
"... I hope they all come back safe."
"Don't worry, Ainar.  Since the Magic Tower has designated hearts as forbidden magic materials, there will be fewer raiders targeting them."
"Right…?"
Of course, the barbarians are the ones who would come back alive, even when they were sent in with barely shoes on their feet.
If we do this much, achieving full survival is a reasonable goal.
"I hope they grow up fast.  Then I can raise the land prices even more."
After confirming that the young warriors had all entered the portal, I quickly dismissed those thoughts.
My role as Tribal Leader is now finished.
"Dad…"
"It's not Dad."
"… What?"
"From now on, call me ‘Team Leader’.
It's time for me to go on the exploration.
