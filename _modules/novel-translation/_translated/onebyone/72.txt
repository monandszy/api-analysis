Chapter 72: Ghostbusters (1)
I looked up at the unfamiliar ceiling and thought. The last thing I saw before I lost consciousness was the city’s characteristic gloomy sky. 
‘This must be a makeshift tent for the injured. There must have been many other casualties besides me.’
Indeed, when I looked to my side, I saw beds lined up side by side. I naturally assessed the situation as if I were breathing.
The tent was silent. Most of the worn-out beds were empty. 
That meant…
‘Quite some time has passed, I see.’
Thus, my tasks were clear. First, I needed to check how much time had elapsed. I slowly tried to sit up to avoid shocking my muscles, but a heavy, alien sensation arose from my abdomen. As I realized what it was, I chuckled. 
‘Where did you go…?’
Misha was sleeping on my stomach. She even snored with her characteristic rumbling sound. She must have been watching over me, intending to care for me, which was commendable. However, I wondered what the point was. 
‘Well, she was tired too.’
Elissa, the priestess of Karui. The ordeal in the witch’s forest. The chase with Riakis, the Chaos Lord. It was understandable, considering everything we’d been through. 
But…
“Misha, wake up.”
My curiosity was paramount at the moment, so I didn’t hesitate to shake Misha awake.
“Huh? Mmm… Bi- Biyorn! You’re awake! How’s your- how’s your body, are you okay?”
“As you can see, I’m fine.”
My shattered left ankle was moving, and my torn arm was restored. In that sense, my first question was:
“Did you use a top-grade potion, by any chance?”
“No, the priest came and treated me.”
“How much was the treatment?”
“Don’t worry about it. The Guild gave disaster relief, so it wasn’t that expensive…”
No, that’s what makes me worry.
“So how much was it?”
“…300,000 stones.”
“I see.”
Phew, still much cheaper than a top-grade potion. I was worried because it was a priest, but it seemed the Guild’s relief funds were quite generous. 
“Why are you making that face? It’s good.”
“But Biyorn doesn’t like money…”
Well, it’s true. What image do I have in her eyes?
“Even so, money can’t be more important than your body.”
It wasn’t just about recovering crushed flesh. It wasn’t even about connecting a severed limb. My arm had been ripped off, bone and all, and it was an arm that we’d left in the labyrinth.
‘It definitely wouldn’t have been possible with natural regeneration alone.’
I cleanly let go of the attachment. During the experiment with Raven in the past, it had taken a tremendous amount of time for a severed finger to regrow, using regeneration alone. 
Anyway, my second question was…
“So how long has it been since we got out of the labyrinth?”
“About 6 hours.”
Well, no wonder it was still bright outside the tent. A whole day hadn’t passed.
“What about the backpack?”
“It’s intact. The stuff inside too!”
“The magic stones?”
“I’ve converted everything, including yours, into money.”
“Did anyone come looking for me while I was unconscious?”
“Ah, Hikurod’s group came by!”
“…The dwarf?”
When I tilted my head, Misha slowly explained what had happened. The gist of it was that she had reunited with Hikurod’s group about 5 hours ago, checking if I was alive.
“It’s a relief that all three of them are fine. So where did they go?”
“They said they were tired since they’d confirmed you were alive, so they went to sleep.”
“I see.”
I didn’t feel any resentment. I would have done the same if the situation was reversed. After all, me staying here wouldn’t make me wake up any faster. We could catch up with each other the day after tomorrow when we’re supposed to meet.
“So what else do we need to do to leave here?”
“Just pack up and go. I’ve taken care of all the troublesome stuff.”
“I see.”
As I was about to get up and throw off the blanket, Misha hurriedly stopped me.
“Wait, don’t get up!”
“…?”
“Fi- First, put this on…”
No further explanation was needed.
“Ah…”
While Misha turned away, I put on the new clothes neatly folded on the table. She even bought me clothes beforehand. Despite appearing clumsy, she has a delicate side.
“Do they fit well?”
“They fit well.”
To be honest, they’re a little too small, but…
Finding clothes that fit in this city is difficult in the first place.
Anyway, when we left the tent, the sun was setting.
“Misha, where’s your accommodation?”
“District 8.”
“Then we can go together.”
As we walked to the accommodation together, the contrast between our surroundings and our attire was stark. People walking around the city were wearing clean everyday clothes, not heavy, rigid metal armor. 
“Biyorn, what are you looking at? Come on, I’m exhausted.”
After walking for about 30 minutes on the clean streets, we reached the accommodation. Apparently, Misha’s accommodation was another 10 minutes from here.
“It’s closer than I thought.”
“Yeah, right? Why didn’t I know that before?”
“Anyway, go now. You’re tired too. Thanks for today.”
“Just, wait a minute!”
Just as I was about to quickly say goodbye and enter the inn, Misha grabbed my wrist.
“Is there anything else you need to know right now?”
“No, not really…”
If not, then what. I gave her a look that demanded her to get to the point, and Misha chuckled before releasing my wrist.
“Okay, I’ll go. You’re going to scold me anyway, saying it’s the same story over and over again.”
“The same story?”
“Then I’ll go, see you tomorrow!”
Before I could even ask back, Misha dashed away.
“Tomorrow?”
Didn’t we agree to all meet the day after tomorrow? Her last words were a bit puzzling, but I didn’t bother to think about it and went into the inn. After taking a quick shower, I had a simple meal on the first floor.
As always, it wasn’t until I lay in bed that the realization hit me.
‘I’m alive again.’
I’m alive again.
Damn it.
***
Noon the next day.
I woke up to the sound of a knock on the door. I usually ignored it and went back to sleep, but this was relentless.
“…Misha?”
“I knew you’d be sleeping.”
“Why are you here? We were supposed to meet tomorrow night.”
Misha chuckled at my complaining question and laid out a bundle on the table. It was food when I looked closer.
“Come here quickly and sit down. You’ll get sick if you sleep like that without eating.”
No, Barbarians don’t care about that? I gave her a look of disbelief, and Misha ended up grabbing my arm and pulling me. 
“Stop arguing and come here. Even if you sleep, you can eat and go back to sleep, right?”
It’s not like anything would happen if I skipped a couple of meals, but she had good intentions, so I readily obliged.
The menu was stir-fried vegetables with eggs and grilled meat.
“How is it?”
“…It’s delicious. Did you make this yourself?”
“Where else would I buy this?”
Just say that. 
Anyway, I didn’t think she would, but it seemed she could cook. 
“I started cooking myself to save some money, but I started enjoying it, so I’ve been doing it ever since.”
“Well, didn’t you say you were staying at an inn?”
“Ah, that’s true, but I happened to become friends with the chef, and he let me use the kitchen.”
“I see.”
“You should try it too, Biyorn, when you get the chance. It’s good because you can save a lot of money.”
Cooking?
She really doesn’t know what she’s saying to a Barbarian. Or maybe she just doesn’t understand Barbarians.
“Cooking is a warrior’s shame.”
“Re- Really?”
When I nodded resolutely, Misha made a “I see” expression and cautiously offered.
“If you really feel that way, I can cook for you…”
What is she saying?
“Stop it, why would you do that? It’s easier to buy food.”
“Ri- Right?”
“By the way, how did you know about the lake? I don’t think I told you that.”
“Ah, that? I asked the innkeeper where the Barbarian was, and he just told me.”
“…I see.”
As I ate the food, engaging in small talk, the plates were soon empty.
“What do you want to do now? Sleep some more?”
I contemplated for a moment before answering. 
“Since we’re here already, I think I’ll go to the commercial district for a while.”
Originally, I was going to sleep until tomorrow night, but I didn’t think I’d be able to sleep again even if I went back to bed. 
It’s a kind of obsession.
Unless I’m about to collapse from exhaustion, I can’t tolerate leaving things undone. 
“That’s good timing. Misha, come with me.”
“Huh? Me? I was going to go back and sleep…”
Misha trailed off, a bewildered look on her face.
From experience, it was necessary to speak strongly in such situations.
“You woke me up, didn’t you? Take responsibility.”
“Hing, okay. I had to go to drop off my equipment anyway…”
Where was she trying to escape to?
***
First, I disposed of all the acquired equipment. I had already paid 2 million stones worth of equipment to the Djaruwi clan in the past as a form of protection money, so it wasn’t as lucrative as I expected.
‘Out of this, I have to separate 1/5th that I got from Hans’ group…’
Still, after selling the equipment and various consumables of the three religious zealots, quite a lot of money was gathered. It helped that one of them was an owner of an expandable backpack. Well, they had that much money to pay too.
“…500,000 stones for repairs?”
“It’s a lightium-made item. It’s one thing if it’s bent or warped, but it’s severely corroded, so there’s nothing we can do.”
Even so, that’s too much. 
4 million stones worth of equipment, and they want 500,000 stones for repairs?
They’re taking advantage of Barbarians…
“Biyorn, don’t be stubborn. He isn’t saying anything wrong…”
My insides were burning, but seeing Misha, a 5-year veteran explorer, say that, it seemed to be the standard price.
So I just paid.
‘…How much money have I lost in total?’
For an efficiency-obsessed gamer, gold loss is scarier than muscle loss. I went over everything meticulously.
‘My mace was left in the labyrinth along with one arm, I used a high-grade potion on the way, the treatment cost 300,000 stones, and the repairs cost 500,000 stones…’
The more I thought about it, the more my stomach ached.
If I hadn’t given them 2 million stones worth of equipment as protection money, I could have laughed this off…
“Biyorn, don’t be like that. I’ll make up for it by working hard to earn money in the future…”
Yes, think positively. 
Honestly, isn’t she the second biggest gain from this exploration?
Ah, of course, the first would be the Orc Hero’s essence. 
‘I also got a lot of consumables like potions, so essentially I’ve saved a lot of money for later…’
“Biyorn, what are you doing? Come on inside.”
I finally finished my thoughts and entered the inn with Misha. It wasn’t our accommodation, but an inn in the Commelvie commercial district.
“I can’t believe the carriage to the port is gone.”
“That’s why I told you to move quickly!”
“I got it, so stop nagging me.”
Upon entering the inn, I asked for two rooms at the counter and got a swat on the back from Misha.
“Are you crazy? Do you know how much it costs per night? Get one room.”
“…One room?”
Shouldn’t it be the other way around?
“It’s not like it’s Lavigion! Places like this usually charge over 10,000 stones per night!”
“I see. One room should be enough.”
I finally realized she was right. It was 9,000 stones per night, even though it seemed cheap at first glance? The prices were insane in the city center. 
My last month’s food expenses were just under 20,000 stones.
‘She had a reason to tell me to move quickly…’
However, the room itself was worth the price. It wasn’t a dormitory-type room like the one I used to stay in, but rather a structure with a living room, a bedroom, and a separate bathroom. It had a window, of course, and even a small terrace in the living room. The room smelled faintly of flowers.
“Biyorn, look at this! Artian workshop soap! They’re giving this for free?!”
Misha, who had initially criticized me for wasting money, discovered something and immediately went into the bathroom. When she came out, her expression was very satisfied.
“Biyorn, let’s work hard to make money from now on.”
I thought she was overreacting, but when I lay down on the wide bed, I couldn’t help but agree.
“Yes… let’s work hard.”
Phew, a bed should be this comfortable.
‘When will I be able to sleep in a bed like this every day…’
I was reminded of how long the road ahead was. 
A city where barbarity and civilization coexist.
How much more plundering and monster-slaying do I need to do to live a more human life in this place?
Snore!
Before I could think deeply, my eyes drifted shut. 
***
At that time, when most were asleep, a tavern where those who enjoyed the day gathered was as bustling as ever, if not more so. 
“Have you heard the news?”
“You mean the story about the floor boss appearing on the third floor?”
“Yes, apparently over thirty people from the Djaruwi clan died because of that guy.”
“Thirty? What’s that? I hear the total death toll reached hundreds, though the Guild will announce it tomorrow.”
“So the culprit who summoned the floor boss still hasn’t been caught?”
It was a juicy piece of gossip that any explorer would find interesting. 
However, besides the common knowledge, a story was slowly spreading, reaching the ears of those in the know.
“Ah, did you know? I heard from a survivor… Apparently, there was one person’s activity that stood out in the Djaruwi clan’s survival.”
“One person? Could it be the vice-captain of the Iron Lion, Macgrein?”
“No, from what I heard, it was a 3rd floor explorer who happened to be there.”
“Hmm, is there anyone in 3rd floor explorers who could do that? What’s his name?”
“Well, that’s the thing…”
Yandell’s son, Biyorn. A Barbarian who entered the 3rd floor only 3 months after becoming an explorer. His unbelievable bravery, saving countless lives, was spread far and wide, sometimes word for word, sometimes with embellishments. 
However, the ending of each story always converged on one point.
“The mage who told me the story didn’t hesitate to say this about the Barbarian.”
“What did he say?”
“He said, without hesitation, that even though he was too young to achieve heroic feats, his actions were undeniably those of a true hero, borrowing the name of the bravest and greatest hero…”
A sobriquet.
A second name that only explorers with skill and fame could acquire. 
“It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to call him the Small Balkan.”
That sobriquet, in particular, could be heard everywhere.
