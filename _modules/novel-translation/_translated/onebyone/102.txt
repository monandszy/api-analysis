“What, what is it! Suddenly……”
“An earthquake……?”
The explorers, awakened by the tremor shaking the very ground, were bewildered. 
I realized. 
Once a Hans, always a Hans.
‘I can’t believe even changing my name wouldn’t do it.’
Sighing deeply, I glanced at the man who would forever be known as Hans G. 
“I, I didn't do anything!”
Yeah, right.
How could you, standing here, be the one who opened the fissure?
It’s just my lousy luck.
“Bjorn?”
“Run!”
I grabbed Misha and started to run. 
There was no time to spare.
Without any further explanation, Misha asked,
“….Did the fissure actually open?”
“Yeah.”
As always, another shitty thing happened in my life. 
Of course, it wasn't the kind of shitty thing that threatened my life.
But…
‘Damn it, how much did I spend?’
I chose the fissure I wanted to enter and purchased items accordingly. 
I was so excited I even enchanted them with lightning properties. 
But then, oh my God, what the heck is this?
“Bjorn! Over there!”
No matter who it was, they had messed up my plan.
A player?
Or simply someone with a lot of knowledge about this world?
Well, I’ll have a feel for it when I get in.
Whoooooosh!
A portal formed in the direction Misha pointed. 
By now, thousands of them had probably been created throughout the first floor.
“Misha!”
I pulled her close, just in case she might fall, and plunged into the portal.
***
“Character has entered the first floor fissure.”
***
Bang-! 
After landing with a heavy thud, I set Misha down. 
Then, I immediately checked my surroundings.
Was it just in time, or were there already three men and women inside the fissure? 
I carefully examined each of them one by one.
“Oh, a Barbarian and a Beastman! You already look formidable.  Nice to meet you.  Call me Carlson.”
First, a human male.
He was a little over five and a half feet tall, armed with a sword. 
If I were to describe his first impression as an animal…
Well, a rat would be about right.
“…I won’t be a burden. Abman Uricfrith.”
Second, a Beastman male. 
Judging by the rounded ears protruding from his head, he seemed to be from the Black Bear clan, one of the seven major clans. 
His defining features would be his muscular physique and his massive crossbow, reminiscent of a siege weapon.
“Hello.  I’m Jensia Neifrin. I use this sword as my weapon.  I’ll try not to be a nuisance.”
Finally, a human female.
She was about five and a half feet tall with a pretty face. 
Surprisingly, she had black hair styled in twintails.
It wasn't bad, but I couldn’t believe someone actually wore their hair like that. 
Anyway, it was our turn, so I introduced myself.
“I'm Bjorn, son of Thor, and this is Michelle. As you can see, we’re together.”
“Huh?”
What huh? 
When I gave her a look that said stay quiet, she seemed to understand and pursed her lips.  Then, she relaxed her eyes and looked into the distance.
…Is that her poker face?
It was obviously suspicious, so I took the lead in the conversation before anyone else got curious. 
“I’ve been assigned the role of guardian within the labyrinth, and I'm most confident in that.  What are you good at?”
It was basic procedure to check each other's capabilities when entering a fissure.
“I’m good with a sword! Oh, and I ate the essence of a Goblin Archer.  I've been trained as a scout since I was little, so I’m somewhat knowledgeable about traps and mechanical devices.”
Jensia, as the woman was called, provided a more detailed description of herself.
A Goblin Swordfighter? No, a Goblin Archer’s essence? 
As soon as I heard it, I thought, what kind of crappy character is this? But it wasn't anything to worry about deeply. 
It wasn’t like she was my character.
It was obvious just from her equipment that she was a newbie.
“I mainly use sword and shield.  That… Bjorn?  Anyway, I’m not as good as him, but in team activities, I generally took the role of tanking attacks.”
Carlson, the sword and shield fighter, was better than Jensia, but ultimately the same. 
At most, mid-level second floor?
Still, he didn't naively reveal his essence like the previous woman, which showed he had some experience. 
Well, maybe he just hadn’t gotten any essence.
‘Two noobs who are useless….’
Well, I had expected it somewhat.
It was different from when I met Hikurod and Raven.  The fissure had only been open for three months, so there was no way for them to be waiting in advance.
Even then, it had opened on the first day, so it was like this. Otherwise, there would have been nothing but locals who couldn’t even reach the second floor.
‘In that sense, it’s suspicious, isn’t it?’
I turned my gaze to the last one.
Was he taking my urge to introduce himself as a cue to do so?
“As you can see.”
The Bear man, with his macho, bearded, and muscle-bound attributes, swaggered his massive crossbow on his back.
He was the only veteran explorer among the three.
I asked him directly, as befits a Barbarian.
“I’d appreciate it if you could tell me for sure how reliable you are.”
“Don’t you have to speak up first when asking that?”
Oh, yeah, true.
“I’m level six, Misha is level seven. We usually operated on the fourth floor.”
“I see, I’m level five.”
Damn, he wasn’t just a veteran, he was a high-level one.
Generally, level six is considered a veteran, level five is a high-level explorer, and level four is the top tier.
The gap between levels is enormous,  as level six and above have to go through guild promotion exams.
Ugh, this is making me even more suspicious.
“Why is someone at your level here?”
“Isn’t that the same for you?”
Damn, this old man is a real smartass. 
“…We used to work as a team, but we had some circumstances that brought us here.  Without a scout, we haven’t been able to make it to the second floor yet, but the fissure opened, so we came in.”
I had prepared this answer in case anyone would be suspicious when the fissure opened.
Only…
“It’s a coincidence.  My situation is similar. Well, it’s been a while since I left my team.”
Ugh, damn it.
‘Is it real or fake?’
I wondered if a tough, archery-wielding badass, the kind who could solo, really existed, but when I looked at the Bear man’s face, it made sense. 
‘Still, I’ll have to be most careful with this old man.’
I designated the Bear man as person of interest number one. 
Not just his strength, but every detail about him was suspicious.
‘If it weren’t for this old man, no one could have come to the second floor and gotten an eighth level magic stone at this time.’
Of course, that’s just based on the information revealed so far.
Carlson and Jensia. 
It’s impossible to rule out the possibility that they’re hiding their true abilities.
“Oh, by the way, who got here first?” 
I casually asked, as if I was just curious.
Who exactly opened the fissure?
If they weren’t all in on it, I thought I could figure out their identities with just this one question.
But…
“Well, I’m not sure. I think we all came in at the same time…”
“It was too simultaneous, so it’s hard to say who was first.”
“You’re concerned about strange things.”
Is it true that I’m not allowed to take the easy way out? 
Ugh, damn it.
This is like playing Mafia, but it’s not.
***
Someone, unknown to me, had opened the fissure.
This threw my plans off track in many ways.
For starters, the distribution issue.
“Well, then, it’s decided.”
After discussion, it was decided that Misha and I would each get three shares, the Bear man would get three shares, and Carlson and Jensia… “Jenson” for short… would split one share.
That’s the ruthless law of the explorer’s world.
“It’s not a big loss.  I’ll give you all the remaining essence.”
“Yes….”
The common tactic known as kicking away the ladder. 
It was the same thing I had done to the dwarf and Raven in the Crimson Citadel.
Of course, I was planning to do the same.
After all, what’s the point of being considerate or giving in here?
‘Damn, he’s more kind than he looks. I was going to keep even the magic stones.’
My plan was to open the fissure on the third day.
I had intended to dominate all the locals on the first floor and clean up the mess.
But the Bear man appeared as a wildcard, and I had to make quite a few concessions in terms of distribution.
For now, Misha would eat the guardian essence, but…
If a Numbers item or a Fissure Stone drops, I’ll have to roll dice with the Bear man. 
‘Ugh, I’m not confident in dice.’
My stomach already hurts.
It’s not that I’m afraid of losing, it’s that I’m not confident in winning. 
That’s why I wanted to avoid the whole dice variable, but…
“Let’s get going then.”
I force myself to forget my regret and move forward.
“Jenson” is on both sides of me, the Bear man is behind them, and Misha is behind him. 
Crack. 
A creaking sound, like walking on thin ice, accompanies every step.
It wasn’t a wrong description.
We were currently passing over a frozen lake.
It was a blessing in disguise. 
‘I can use the stuff I prepared.’
There are a total of four first-floor fissures. 
Depending on the type, the monsters that appear, the difficulty level, and even the rewards differ.
So where should we go?
After much deliberation, I chose a place, and it was, coincidentally, where I was walking now.
[Ice Cave]
An eighth-level monster that appears in the second floor Beast’s Den.
The fissure opens when you offer its magic stone to the altar.
By the way, the only reason I chose this was Misha.
Well, I did get an essence slot when I reached level four this time, but…
‘There’s really nothing I want to eat.’
It’s just a first-floor fissure.
Even the guardian is only level seven, and none of them spit out the kind of essence I’d want.
‘That’s probably why this old man was willing to give up the essence so easily.’
Anyway, I decided it would be more efficient to level Misha up now and use that to fill the empty slot with a better essence later —
Oh, wait, hold on.
I think something similar happened before, and then Ainarr went to the holy land…
‘Is he going to do the same thing again…?’
“Why did you stop suddenly?”
“It’s nothing.”
I shake off the sudden thought and focus on my surroundings.
Still, we’ve entered the fissure. 
Especially since there’s that unknown Mafia out there, now’s not the time to relax.
Shooosh, whoosh, whoosh.
Frozen snow mountain. 
Snowflakes swirling and scattering from above.
And the sunlight reflecting off the ice, making it feel even sharper.
‘It’s been so long since I’ve been out of the dark.  It feels unfamiliar.’
After walking for about thirty minutes, we reached the end of the lake area and saw a mysterious cave leading underground.
By the way, a monster was blocking our way.
“Grrrrooowwwwwlll!”
A level seven Yeti.
A gatekeeper-level elite monster that appears only in the Ice Cave, right from the start.
The moment it saw us, it let out a menacing roar.
“I, is this the place where we have to kill this monster and go down?” Jensia murmured. 
The Bear man answered. 
“I don’t know about this place, but in a fissure, a place with a monster is usually the way.” 
A gamer’s answer that instinctively makes me nod.
Somehow, it’s making him even more suspicious…
“Don’t get reckless and die.  You two stay back.”
“….Are you sure we can just do that?”
Jenson looked at me and Misha, touched by the Bear man’s considerate offer.
Well, it would be heartless to ask them to risk their lives against such a guy just for 10% of the magic stones. 
So, I just told them it was okay.
It felt like it would be a nuisance to have them flitting around.
“I’ll go first.” 
The Bear man finally took his massive crossbow off his back. 
Then… 
Whoooooosh!!
The battle began with him shooting an arrow.
