Chapter 76: Ghostbusters (5)
The Laphdonia Royal Family's direct secret security force.
"What? He came back beaten to a pulp?"
The man let out a dry laugh at the subordinate's report. He couldn't even figure out where to start scolding him.
"Tell me this first, why did you contact that guy? My orders were to simply follow him."
"...It's considered a decision made in the field."
"A decision? Are you kidding me? Speak clearly."
"He is a 3-month old Barbarian, so we judged that it would be easy to identify his true identity."
The man sighed deeply. It wasn't incomprehensible.
Most demons under a year old are incredibly naive. Simply approaching them and pretending to be in the same situation is enough to expose more than half of them.
The rest, even if they don't reveal themselves, often show their true nature through their expressions.
"So there was no such reaction?"
"Yes, he frowned immediately and told him to speak properly, without any complicated language. It seems you should see it yourself."
The subordinate pulled out a button from his pocket. A specially designed video recorder.
As he brought it to the crystal ball on the desk, the events that took place at the scene were replayed.
The man observed the Barbarian's change in expression, his gaze, the movement of his facial muscles in detail, rewinding the recording several times.
[America? Taiwan? Europe? Where are you from?]
The guy who messed up this time had approached too carelessly, it's true...
But this reaction is definitely special.
[What are you saying? Don't talk in riddles, speak clearly.]
An instant response.
Ordinary demons would panic and rack their brains to figure out the other person's identity.
But what about this Barbarian?
[Wow, I almost fell for it. You're not actually a 3-month old, are you?]
[Acting? I told you not to use difficult words.]
Vocabulary and tone.
[Then I'll ask simply. Are you a demon?]
[Why hide it now? Yes, I am. Therefore...]
Thought and doubt.
[That's enough. No need to say more.]
[What do you mean—]
[The chieftain said it. We must kill demons whenever we see them.]
And response.
Everything is clearly different from the typical demons.
No, rather, it aligns with the unique reactions that only non-demons would display.
"Even those who don't want to reveal their identity would usually choose to evade in that situation."
But what about this Barbarian?
He chose to charge head-on, the moment he made his decision.
Without any hesitation, a true Barbarian.
The man, after a moment of contemplation, reached his final conclusion.
"He definitely doesn't seem like a demon."
Bjorn Yandell.
Just as his name caught our eye, the demons must have shown interest in him as well.
But he only gained notoriety a few days ago.
'The 'Gathering' hasn't even been held yet, so he wouldn't have heard about our tactics...'.
All the circumstances point to him not being a demon.
Even if he knew about the existence of the Secret Security Force, it's questionable if he could react like that.
More importantly, the incident in the guild was impressive.
He was framed and faced death, but he escaped and caused havoc? It's not something refined demons would do, no matter how you look at it.
Unless it was a Barbarian who doesn't care about anything.
Therefore—
"Bjorn Yandell is innocent."
The man stamped a blue seal on the report.
He filed the report into a folder and placed it in a cupboard.
The subordinate watching him let out a sigh of relief.
"...Thank goodness."
"Yeah, thank goodness. If he had been beaten to a pulp by a demon, he would have been dead by my hand."
"What about disciplinary action?"
"He contacted the target on his own accord during the surveillance mission. We'll give him a 3-month suspension, 12-month salary cut after that, and hold off on his promotion review until next year."
"Understood, I'll pass it on."
The subordinate left the office, and the man sat alone, lost in thought for a while.
'He wasn't a demon, yet he gained a title at the age of 3 months...'.
Regardless of this incident, he's worth keeping an eye on in the future.
'Does he truly have the fate of a hero? Perhaps the Count will be pleased with him.'
This city always needs talented individuals.

'Is it morning already...?'
I spent the whole night with my eyes open.
It's because of the letter I found last night.
Is the content of this letter true or not?
I pondered until the sun rose and sighed.
'It seems like it's real, but...'.
It's just a hunch, I can't be certain.
So, as soon as it got light, I washed up quickly and went outside.
I first planned to find out about this pill.
Of course, there's also a good chance that this is the demon hunters' tactic...
'No, this is why I need to show that I'm trying to find out.'
Think about it from the perspective of a local.
Someone breaks into my room and leaves a letter with illegible writing and a pill?
It's normal to be curious about their identity.
It's a creepy thing for them, after all.
"I thought you forgot our appointment since you haven't been here for a few days, but I guess not?"
That's why I visited the Mage Tower.
I figured that a mage, an intellectual in this world, might know something.
She actually did know something about it.
Much more than I expected.
"Oh, the pill arrived, so it seems you really did gain some fame this time?"
That was Raven's reaction when I showed her the letter and the pill.
"Fame?"
"Yeah. So you don't have to worry too much. I heard you get them once you become a bit famous."
Raven then licked her lips as she looked at the letter.
"Still, a bit disappointing. It would have been nice if you had come to me directly."
By the way, the letter was blank.
It had magic on it, and the writing disappeared within 10 minutes of reading it.
"Don't you want to know, Yandell? What did the demons write in their letter?"
"Demons?"
"Ah, I didn't tell you that. It's a letter from the demons."
"I didn't even realize it was a letter. You're amazing, as always."
When I naturally added a compliment, Raven made her signature snorting sound.
And, as usual, she went into TMI mode.
"Of course, you would. It's something normal people don't know. Can I have the pill?"
"Here you go."
"Do you know what this pill is?"
"No."
"It was made by a very skilled mage. And one with incredible knowledge of mental magic, dimensional magic, and alchemy."
"So, what is the pill?"
To my short question, she gave a long preface about how countless mages had worked hard to decipher the spell, before finally getting to the point.
"If you take this pill, you can enter a specific spiritual world."
"Spiritual world?"
"Ah, that might be a bit hard to understand. Think of it as another kind of dimension. Your body sleeps while your mind travels somewhere."
Raven's explanation continued after that.
To summarize, it went like this.
1. If you take this pill, you will be summoned to a specific spiritual world at midnight on the 15th of every month.
2. The demons probably exchange information among themselves there.
3. Many people took the pill and infiltrated, but they were found dead the next morning, vomiting blood.
At this point, I flinched slightly.
"Found dead?"
"Yeah. So, since you're curious, Yandell, don't eat it."
"Wait, isn't it just a poison?"
"Aw, what do you think of our mages? I swear, there's no such ingredient or spell in this pill."
"Then who are the dead ones?"
"Well, there are many hypotheses... but the most likely one is that they have a way to distinguish those who are not demons. The soul and body separate, leading to the death of the body."
"...It's a dangerous pill."
This was genuine.
After all, the moment I take this pill, my life is in the hands of those guys.
Of course, I'm now somewhat convinced that the guy who sent the pill is a player...
But I don't know what kind of guy that player is.
"Anyway, it's definitely not poison. There's an unofficial record that a captured demon confessed about this gathering. It means that the pill isn't a poison that kills anyone."
"I see."
"Oh, and one more thing, they say that you're in the form of a soul there, so you can't actually tell who they are."
That's good news.
And this cleared up most of my doubts.
Is this why connections are important?
If I hadn't been connected to a mage, I wouldn't have heard this story anywhere.
However, I asked one more thing.
"Is there any way to identify someone who took this pill?"
"Absolutely not. If there was, we'd have caught all the demons by now."
I see.
Now I understand why the sender said that anonymity was strictly guaranteed in the community.
"So, can I study this pill a little?"
"If you'll trade it for a day's worth of work, I don't mind."
"What a cheapskate, I answered all your questions. Forget it. It's not like I'll find anything more by studying it anyway. Now, come sit down here."
Following her instructions, I sat down on the chair.
I didn't bother asking if this chair was a torture device used for crushing people's heads.
"I'm going to start now."
"...Hurry up and finish."
Now that I know, you see.
Zzzzt-!!
This chair was a magical tool for blood extraction.
***
Around four in the afternoon, my day's worth of research was done.
This means I won't have to waste time coming to the Mage Tower until next week.
"Oh, is this the famous guy we've been hearing about?"
"They say the name Little Balkan was given to him by Hernecion..."
"That strict fellow thought so highly of a Barbarian? Interesting."
As I exited Raven's private study, I saw mages gathered in the lobby.
They all had their eyes on me.
Is this the power of fame?
'Last time, they treated me like a piece of leftover experimental material...'
I realized how much my name had increased—
"They say he ate the essence of the Orc hero?"
"Arul said he has the essence of the Vampire Guardian as well."
"Indeed... this is, a treasure."
They looked at me like I wasn't just ordinary experimental material, but something extremely valuable.
Come to think of it, would an explorer's fame be something these guys would care about?
"Hey, come here for a second, would you?"
"I'm busy."
"No, just for a moment—"
"I'm hungry, so I can't."
I ran out of the Mage Tower as if I were escaping, pushing through the gazes that were even more unpleasant than usual.
'It's too early to go to the library, so I guess I'll just go back and rest.'
I returned to the inn after an hour, thinking about things and resting on the bed as if I had collapsed.
Then I took out the pill and examined it carefully.
My mind becomes deep, as if it were being submerged.
'A community where anonymity is guaranteed...'
The biggest reason I avoided contact with other players was the risk.
If even one person knows, it's no longer a secret.
But, listening to Raven, it seems like a virtual web space, no different.
Well, before, I thought what was the use of contacting players...
But now, my thoughts have changed a little.
'Those people probably know more than me.'
I'm not talking about hidden items or hidden information within the game.
I wouldn't know what they know.
However, this is not a world made of decimals like in a game, but another world.
Since the risk of identity exposure has decreased, the advantages have become more prominent.
'I need to confirm it myself, but it's not bad to be able to get information ahead of time.'
For example, what tactics the demon hunters use. Or how the Explorer's Guild is creating new laws and testing them.
Joining the community would make it much easier to access these latest developments.
In short, it would be like having a secret source of information.
'I don't have high expectations, but maybe they know how to go back.'
After pondering for a long time, looking at the pill, I made a decision.
'It's still better to take it.'
I carefully weighed the risks I had to take and the returns I could get, and made my decision.
But I don't plan on taking it right now.
I also need time to check for other risks...
'Even if anonymity is guaranteed, someone sent the invitation.'
Think about it.
What if there are three people who sent invitations, and all three join the community?
Those who sent the invitation will be able to deduce the identities and statuses of those three.
'If I take it, it would be safer to wait at least 3 months to half a year.'
Of course, if the community isn't run the way I think it is, all these assumptions are meaningless.
But...
'I don't need the information right now.'
Let's wait patiently, as we always have.
It's true that nothing is guaranteed in life.
***
A certain study room on the upper floors of the Mage Tower.
[00 : 01]
The moment the minute hand of the clock passed midnight.
A man lying in a chair opened his eyes.
He immediately got up and contacted someone through the crystal ball.
"Soulqueens, how did the new recruits go this time?"
He tried to hide it, but his voice clearly revealed his anticipation and excitement.
But soon, a deep look of disappointment appeared on the man's face.
[There were none.]
"Hmm, so that guy really isn't a player."
[It's highly likely. So what are you going to do about the letters that weren't sent this time?]
The man pondered for a moment.
Originally, there were supposed to be seven letters sent before this gathering. But this time, only one was sent.
Because there was something I needed to confirm.
But...
"I can't delay this any longer because of my whims. Could you send the letters that weren't sent this time sequentially until the next gathering?"
[Yes, I'll pass it on.]
The short conversation ended there.
The study room, now filled with tranquility.
"He chose a shield at his coming-of-age ceremony, so I had high hopes."
The man sighed and muttered.
"It wasn't 'that one' again."
At this point, he even thought the rumor circulating among players might be true.
He had firmly denied it before...
'But thinking about it, it doesn't make sense that he compiled all that data alone...'
Does 'that one' really exist?
Was it really just someone from the game company, as many had speculated?
It's been 20 years since he opened his eyes in this unfamiliar world.
Cracks were starting to appear in the man's belief.
