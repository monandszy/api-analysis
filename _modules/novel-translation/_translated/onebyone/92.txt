Chapter 92: Player (4)
The vacant lot began to buzz with activity as my nickname was revealed. I closed my eyes for a moment and assessed the situation.
First, these people were talking about "Elfnuna." That was the nickname I used. I had chosen it because my character was an elf at the time, without giving it much thought. And…
“I wrote a stat guide too…”
It had been around three years, hadn't it? I had put a lot of effort into organizing it, so I posted it on the forum for both storage and sharing. As expected from a dead game forum, I remember the views never going above 100 in the year it was there.
But…
“Why is everyone looking at me like I’m some rare named boss?”
Come to think of it, that woman earlier said she was a fan of mine. Why?
The last time I had accessed that community was five years ago, or something like that.
“…Did I become famous without knowing?”
Whatever the reason, I had reached a conclusion. I was famous. I could figure out the reason for my newfound fame later. For now, I had gathered enough clues to handle the situation.
“Ah, you’ve got it wrong,” I said with a bright smile, waving my hand. “I’m a fan of theirs. If you read my nickname carefully, you’ll see it’s Elfnunna, not Elfnuna. ‘Nuna.’”
It was a stroke of luck that I had changed a single letter of the spelling due to a duplicate nickname. I absolutely detested unnecessary attention.
“Oh, now that you mention it…”
“Your nickname is different,” someone said.
The men looked at my nickname again at my words.
“It’s Elfnunna! Not Elfnuna!”
“What, you’re an impersonator…?”
“It couldn't be. We were expecting someone from Korea…”
They sighed in disappointment. Some of them even glared at me with a hint of disdain, likely due to feeling tricked.
“Haha, a fan can make mistakes like that!”
The leader, “Darkman,” laughed and intervened to ease the tension, introducing a few rules to be followed in the room. Things like always addressing each other respectfully, and being expelled for disruptive behavior. I don’t recall anything else worth remembering.
“Well, I’m going to go now, so feel free to chat amongst yourselves. You can leave whenever you want.”
The welcoming atmosphere towards the newcomer was short-lived. The people returned to their previous positions and resumed their hushed conversations. As I was pondering where to go, a white man approached me. He was a player named "Pinkguy."
“How long have you been playing, Elfnunna?”
“Ah, I’m a year in.”
Technically, I was only five months in, but I figured they might find it odd if I said I had joined so early. However, the response I got was unexpected.
“Really? You got your letter pretty late, didn't you?”
“Huh?”
“Well, only a select few gain fame and receive letters. Most get them early on, when it’s obvious.”
“I see…”
“The fact that you only received your letter now means you’ve been doing a good job of blending in. I started as a human and am still just carrying stuff, but I got mine.”
“Oh, yeah…”
“Anyway, if you're a year in, that means it’s only been about 70 days in your world… You must know a lot about what’s going on there. How is it?”
I wasn’t sure if there were any events worth mentioning, so I asked back like I had misheard.
“70 days…? What do you mean?”
I had clearly just said I was a year in. Why was he saying it was 70 days ago?
Pinkguy’s face fell as he continued.
“Ah, if it’s your first time, you wouldn't know. Time flows differently in this world compared to yours.”
“Different?”
“Yeah. One month on Earth is about five months here.”
In simple terms, it meant a 1:5 time ratio.
A strange feeling washed over me.
‘Only a month has passed…’
I was glad that less time had passed, but I wondered if they had filed a missing persons report. Someone other than my company should have been looking for me.
As I continued to converse with Pinkguy, I learned about various things.
“Going back? Well, there’s a lot of speculation, but they say nothing is certain yet.”
Even players who had been here much longer than me hadn’t figured out how to return. Apparently, the founder of the Ghostbusters was a seasoned veteran, a 20-year-old.
“You cleared that game five years ago? That’s amazing, isn’t it?”
“I know, right?”
With each piece of new information, I felt a sense of defeat. It was like my pride as a seasoned player was crumbling. After all, everyone here had arrived before me and reached the Abyssal Gate, making them all experts.
‘They may seem clueless on the surface, but they’re all incredible people...’
“So, Elfnunna, what multiplier did you clear it on?”
Huh? Multiplier?
I looked at him in confusion, not understanding what he was asking. The man added,
“You didn’t clear the original version, did you? You must have cleared the remake too, Elfnunna. What multiplier did you use?”
I still didn’t understand what he was getting at. Remake?
“You’ll understand if I say ‘pirated copy.’ You know, that game file that was posted on the Stone Iven forum five years ago, the one that lets you adjust experience points and drop rates.”
Oh…
Was there something like that?
Pinkguy then spoke with a hidden pride.
“Oh, I’m not bragging, but I cleared it on 50x.”
How could there be so many people who had cleared this game? This was the moment all my long-standing questions were answered.
***
[Dungeon and Stone].
The game I had poured ten years of my life into, a game that had barely allowed me to enter the final boss room. Even as I played, I couldn't help but wonder how there could be a game with such a high difficulty level. 
But…
‘You could set the maximum experience to 100 times and the drop rate to 100 times?’
Crazy! What kind of cheat setting is that?
I had no idea the level cap was 30. I had been stuck at level 11, even after killing every monster in the labyrinth.
‘Wait, if the level cap is 30, that means you can feed 30 essences to a single character?’
Honestly, I couldn’t even imagine it.
This was like… a situation where you didn’t have to give anything up or make any choices. You could just cram everything in.
It made me feel like a fool for agonizing over the synergy of each essence and meticulously planning the best combination.
Apparently, even the fissures, the key to growth, could be opened at any desired time…
‘With a 100x drop rate, you could just spam out number items.’
Thirty essences.
And a super-munchkin character armed with all sorts of divine instruments.
What if five of those characters formed a party?
The Ancient Dragon, the Lord of Destruction, Leviathan… they would all just be crushed with a single blow, regardless of how many times I had tried to defeat them.
“So, Elfnunna, what multiplier did you clear it on?”
“…I also used 50x.”
“Ah, I see. Wasn’t it hard?”
Hard? Not at all.
With these conditions, I could clear it in one try, regardless of dimensional collapse or any other bullshit event.
But…
‘It wouldn’t be beneficial to say that, would it?’
Just like how the Demon Slayer found me right after I gained fame, excessive attention is a poison. It’s foolish to risk getting involved with someone just to brag.
I decided to avoid being showy and just learn what I needed to know.
“What multiplier did the person who created this place use?”
“Ah, that person? Don’t be surprised. They cleared it on a 15x multiplier. It was possible because they were an original player.”
“15x… I see.”
I pretended to be surprised, as it seemed like something worth being surprised about. According to Pinkguy, the average multiplier used by players was 60 to 80x…
It wasn’t until I heard that that the conversations of those who were laughing and chatting far away suddenly pierced my ears.
“Haha, this world is truly insane. I still haven’t even been to the fissure. In the game, you could just click it.”
“Ugh, imagine how hard it is to even reach the final floor if it’s this difficult to even enter the fissure…”
“I heard the game was full of Easter eggs. I should have looked for some of those.”
The players were lamenting, comparing the remake they had played to reality. I couldn’t blame them. This was the real-world version, with difficulty levels even higher than the original.
“Ugh…”
A thick sense of disillusionment washed over me.
Senior players who had cleared this game before me.
As I thought about that, I tried to soothe myself by focusing on finding things to learn rather than trying to tear them down…
But this was just too embarrassing.
“Elfnunna?”
“Sorry. I was lost in thought…”
I continued to converse with Pinkguy for a while. I learned things that were common knowledge for any ordinary player, and gained a much deeper understanding of how this community operated. I also solved one of my questions.
‘The remake… so the pirated version spread, causing the game to become popular again, and my nickname became famous along with it…’
Overall, my conversation with Pinkguy was beneficial. It was even quite enjoyable.
“Ugh, I just want to have a proper pizza. Elfnunna, what do you want to eat?”
“Cola and beef soup.”
“Beef soup? What kind of food is that?”
“It’s the most efficient food I’ve ever had.”
It had been a while since I had a conversation like this.
***
After exchanging a few words with other people, I left the newbie room. Pinkguy asked if he could add me as a friend, and I politely declined. He was a good person, but I didn’t want to get close to him.
He was being too nice. It was like he was treating me like some kind of romantic interest.
‘Anyway, I think I know everything I need to…’
I returned to the room with the computer and continued to absorb information, reading through forum posts and announcements.
Now it was time to fulfill my purpose for coming here.
‘Let’s start looking into this dimensional collapse.’
I tapped the keyboard and checked the timer in the lower right corner.
It had already shrunk from 12 hours to 7 hours.
Apparently, the space would close when time ran out, even if I didn’t manually log out, so I had to hurry.
[Exchange]
I manipulated the mouse to open the exchange page.
This service allowed you to purchase information, items, and other things using Ghost Points, GP.
In simpler terms, it meant you could obtain goods or buy rare items using GP.
However…
‘It’s best not to touch this, I think.’
I decided to avoid using this feature as much as possible.
For items, they would have to pass through reality.
Even if there was a complex intermediary system.
Even if the system seemed quite safe.
Ultimately, the actual goods would be exchanged in reality, creating a point of contact between me and the barbarians.
[Owned GP: 0]
Therefore, I also passed on the option of charging GP using real-world money.
Of course, I needed GP to purchase information about the dimensional collapse…
But that wasn’t a major issue.
I could make do here.
Click, tap.
I manipulated the mouse to apply a [Information] filter to the exchange items. Then I switched the category to [Purchase Request].
Countless questions appeared.
[20 GP] Is there any way to easily reach the 2nd floor?
[100-500 GP] I’m training a melee character. I want to know a powerful training method for early game.
The easier questions came with lower GP rewards.
But…
[7,000 GP] I want to know the details of each event in the Sky Tower on the 4th floor.
[2,800 GP] I want to know the exact conditions for the passive skill ‘Dragon Master.’
More advanced questions came with higher rewards.
Therefore, I sorted them by highest price.
That was the most efficient way to do it.
[70,000 GP] Buying information on how to defeat the 1st floor layer boss. No jokes.
[69,000 GP] Please contact me if you know a lot about Skull Island on the 6th floor.
The 1st floor layer boss?
[A 1:1 conversation request has been sent to TacitRonin.]
[Transaction complete.]
[Owned GP: 70,000]
Skull Island, the hidden element on the 6th floor?

I knew everything about this game.
