Chapter 51: Team Half-Penny (1)
“Rotmiller, is anyone nearby?” 
Was he perhaps harboring similar suspicions? 
Rotmiller closed his eyes, then opened them again, scanning his surroundings with narrowed pupils.
“Brown Rotmiller has activated [Thermal Detection].”
The lizardman scout’s innate ability, ‘Thermal Detection’.
Its function was akin to a modern thermal imaging camera.
Worth noting, it was a fairly useful skill in the game too. Regardless of whether a creature used invisibility or any other skill, this one ability could detect them all.
“There's no one nearby.”
Rotmiller deactivated his ability and offered a short reply.
“But by the smell, someone was here a short while ago.” 
His judgment, backed by two essences that augmented his olfactory stat, was unlikely to be wrong.
I asked him a few more questions.
“What do you mean by ‘a short while ago’?”
“There's a margin of error, but based on this scent, it couldn't have been more than two minutes at most.”
“In other words, there's a very high probability that they left after seeing us hunting?”
“…That's likely.”
Rotmiller nodded with a wistful expression, and the dwarf, who had been silently listening, piped up in alarm.
“Hold on, are you saying someone was deliberately targeting us?”
“I doubt they were specifically targeting us. They were probably just waiting for someone to show up.”
Rotmiller didn't deny it.
He explained that it was a common tactic for raiders to lure monsters in front of portals.
Among them, it was known as a low-risk looting method.
‘A cunning bunch, they are.’
Using monsters to ambush.
Targeting the moment when adventurers are most vulnerable, fresh from a portal.
If they wiped out the entire team, great. If they injured a few, that's good too. If they survived unscathed, they'd simply retreat and wait for the next prey.
“Rotmiller! Shouldn't we catch and punish them? Raiders are worth money when you kill them!” 
“Even if we wanted to, finding them would be difficult. We can't stay here forever… and more importantly, there's no evidence. We can't rule out the possibility of being framed.”
“Tch, the dead tell no tales!”
Misha, having learned the truth, huffed and puffed in frustration, but the dwarf, as the leader, made a cold judgment.
“Out of a sense of duty, we'll go down to the second floor and leave a warning about raiders in front of the portal, then depart.”
“A wise decision.”
After fulfilling our duty as adventurers, we left the portal area.
Naturally, the conversation continued, revolving around raiders.
However, the more I listened, the more I felt something was off.
“Rotmiller is amazing. I never even knew such a tactic existed.”
“I’ve only heard about it, this is the first time I've been on the receiving end of it.”
“Well, you don’t encounter raiders all the time, do you!”
What the heck are they talking about?
I felt an alienation from their unfamiliar adventurer talk and asked several questions.
Then I realized a shocking truth.
“I mean, in the past five years, I’ve encountered raiders maybe eight times? Once, we were on the same team, and the rest were all nothing special!”
Only eight times in five years?
Damn, aren’t raiders supposed to be a regular occurrence for adventurers?
“Come to think of it… about 150 years ago, there was a time when it was like that!”
Misha explained that following the death of the first king, also known as the immortal king, various policies had significantly reduced the number of raiders.
But I couldn't grasp it.
Something had to be wrong.
Otherwise, it wouldn't make sense.
‘Once in the Crystal Cave, once in the Goblin Forest, twice in a row in the Land of the Dead…’
Including today, I've encountered raiders five times in the past three months.
So, what the hell am I?
When I told them this story, hoping to get their opinions, everyone, including Rotmiller, looked at me with strange expressions.
“Bjorn, how many sins did you commit in your previous life?”
“Hahaha! Maybe you being here is why you encountered raiders today!”
“…”
I had no words.
What kind of life had I been living?
Lacking the energy to argue, I fell silent and walked on. Then, Rotmiller sighed and spoke.
“Stop teasing him. Everyone knows that Kalstain has a particularly lucky streak.”
“Ah! That's it then—!” 
“I also encounter raiders about once every three months. So, don't worry too much about it.”
Ah, um, well…
It's nice that he's trying to comfort me.
But five times in three months is still too much.

The 3rd floor, ‘Pilgrim's Path’.
Regardless of whether you passed through the Land of the Dead, the Goblin Forest, or the Beast's Lair, you eventually end up here.
The starting point differed depending on the route, so you’d actually have to follow the path all the way to the center, where the 4th-floor portal was, to encounter adventurers from other routes.
‘It's said it takes an average of three to four days to reach the center…’
Keep in mind that this is just the time taken for movement, focused solely on traveling. The 3rd floor was simply incomparable in size to the previous floors.
Therefore, in addition to the name ‘Pilgrim's Path’, it was also called by individual names based on the habitats of the monsters. One such place was ‘Steel Rock Hill’, where I currently stood.
“We'll set up camp here for today and head to the next area tomorrow.”
The border of one area ending.
We began preparing for camp in this ambiguous location. The reason was that because the territories of various monsters overlapped here, there were relatively fewer monsters wandering around.
“By the way, Dwaki, are you alright? You haven’t looked very good since earlier.”
The dwarf, who had finished setting up his sleeping bag on the ground, spoke to Dwaki.
Rotmiller, Misha, and I all pretended to be listening.
Naturally, we were curious.
Why this talkative fellow had been wearing a perpetually sour expression.
“…Did I look that way?”
“It might just be my imagination, but that’s what it looked like to me.”
“I see…”
Dwaki nodded with a wry smile.
Then, after a moment's hesitation, he finally opened up.
“I know what you’re thinking. You probably see me as naive and immature. But… honestly, it was a shock.”
“A shock?”
“No, it’s more accurate to say my illusions were shattered. I’ve always heard stories about adventurers since I was young, but… I’ve never heard anything like this.”
Adventurers killing other adventurers.
In turn, adventurers killing those adventurers for money.
Clearly, it wasn’t a reality filled with dreams and childhood innocence.
“Tch, what I said before was just a, a joke!”
“Joke or not, it’s all the same. I guess if I continue being an adventurer, I’ll end up killing someone too.” 
At that, everyone fell silent.
“…”
“…”
Comforting him at this point would be a lie.
The dwarf, Misha, Rotmiller, and I all have experience killing people.
And as Dwaki continues in this profession, he’ll inevitably face that experience someday.
“So, I’ve prepared myself. During my journey here, I’ve constantly…”
His resolute murmur, far more collected than expected, prompted me to ask one question.
“So, what’s the result? Have you come to terms with the fact that you’ll have to do it?”
Dwaki’s resolve was filled with confusion.
He lacked confidence in himself, and his fear of the situation was palpable.
However…
“That’s enough.”
It’s actually better this way.
Better than those idiots who make empty promises they can’t keep, then whine about not being able to do it when the time comes.
As if sharing my sentiment, Rotmiller, who had been listening to the conversation, made a blunt remark.
“It’s important not to overestimate yourself. It sounds far more reassuring to me than saying you’ll be able to do it.”
“Really?”
Seeing Dwaki’s awkward expression, Rotmiller flashed a warm smile.
As if looking at a young man walking the same path.
“You understand that it’s something you have to do, and you’ve made up your mind to do it. With that kind of determination, I’m sure you’ll be able to handle it when the time comes.”
“I hope so…”
“Hahaha! Cheer up, buddy!”
With the dwarf slapping Dwaki on the back, the conversation ended.
However, as we were about to decide the watch order and lie down…
“Just a moment, can everyone spare some time?”
Rotmiller suddenly called out to the group.
“I know it’s best to get as much rest as possible for the team, but there’s something I want to show you.”
“What is it?”
In response to my question, Rotmiller looked at Dwaki and said,
“It’s not all hardship and horrors when you do this kind of work.”
Then, Rotmiller checked his watch and moved towards the cliff near the campsite.
We followed him, confused.
We could only see the same darkness as always. 
The darkness of the labyrinth swallowed even the light, constantly hindering the adventurers’ vision.
“You said you had something to show us?”
“Just a moment, just a moment.”
Rotmiller looked at his watch as he replied. It suddenly dawned on me and I pulled out my watch.
[23:59]
One minute before the third day began, when the number of monsters reached its peak.
The second hand ticked away.
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5…
I closed my watch and stared into the darkness beyond the cliff. Soon, silver orbs of light appeared in the distance, within the darkness.
There were countless of them, all starting from the ground, swirling like dandelion seeds towards the sky.
As a result, the dark labyrinth slowly began to brighten.
Only then did I realize why this place was called Steel Rock ‘Hill’.
“Only adventurers who arrive early get to see this. A spectacular sight, isn't it?”
Hill.
This place was a high-altitude location within the labyrinth.
It was usually too dark to fully grasp, but with countless orbs of light dispelling the darkness, the vast expanse of the third floor came into view.
Mountains and plains, a river flowing between them.
Lush forests and, in the center, a towering spire reaching up to the ceiling.
Had I lived only within the walls of Raffdonia all my life, I would never have seen such a sight.
Dwaki, who had been staring blankly, muttered.
“…I think I finally understand what adventurers mean when they say the world is vast.”
I raised my head and looked at the sky.
It might be a sealed ceiling, but for this moment, it felt like the true sky.
A wide-open night sky filled with the Milky Way.
Of course, that moment was truly fleeting.
It took only a minute or so for the orbs of light that had started from the ground to reach the ceiling and disappear.
“No one knows why this phenomenon only occurs on the third floor.”
There are many theories.
Perhaps it’s the release of excess magical energy from the labyrinth’s dimension as the third day begins.
Or maybe it’s a blessing from the gods.
Everyone believes what they want to believe.
But Rotmiller made a definitive statement.
“Whatever the reason, one thing is clear. Once you witness this sight firsthand, you stop wondering about why.”
“That’s right! I’ve only heard stories, this is the first time I’m seeing it! I would’ve been sleeping soundly in my sleeping bag if it weren’t for this!”
“Hahaha! I have a feeling this guy won’t be sleeping tonight.”
After the light completely faded and the familiar darkness once again engulfed the labyrinth, everyone except me, who was on first watch, went to sleep in their sleeping bags.
However…
“…”
It was a long time later that I heard a sigh coming from Dwaki’s sleeping bag.
***
Daybreak arrived.
Not that the surroundings actually brightened.
But it was daybreak in terms of time.
[08:10]
We packed up camp and walked downhill for a long time, leaving Steel Rock Hill behind.
Then we reached our first destination.
“Alright, this is where the Orc Encampment is.”
Orc Encampment.
Among the many areas on the third floor, it was the place with the highest concentration of monsters. The characteristic feature was that only monsters of level 8 or higher appeared there.
‘There’s no better hunting ground than here unless we’re going straight to the 4th floor.’
The difficulty level was second-highest among the third-floor areas.
But if my prediction is correct, there shouldn’t be much danger for us.
Our team is capable of operating on the 4th floor.
We have a mage, and even excluding me, the other three were originally adventurers who operated on the 4th floor.
“Let’s first train our skills together for a while, then make a decision based on the results.”
After reorganizing our formation, we stepped into the vast forest.
Of course, by reorganizing, I mean simply moving Rotmiller to the back and having the dwarf and I take his place.
“Murad, there’s an Orc group approaching from the 1 o’clock direction.”
As expected of a popular hunting ground with high monster density, even on the outskirts, we encountered a group of orcs after walking a short distance.
“Whiz, whiz—!”
A group with the standard composition of four Orc Warriors, one Archer, and one Shaman.
“We'll do what we practiced!”
We took our positions according to our previous practice.
Namely, Formation A.
The dwarf and I firmly held the front, while Misha, as the melee dealer, freely moved between the shield wall, prioritizing the closest enemies.
“[Lyol Warb Dwaki has activated the 8th level offensive magic [Ice Shard].”
Since we didn't need curse magic against orcs, Dwaki focused solely on his combat role.
The same went for Rotmiller.
He also focused on providing rear support with his crossbow when the battle started.
However, he also had one more role.
“[The Orc Shaman has activated [Zeal].”
“[The Orc Warriors’ physical resistance has increased threefold for 10 seconds].”
If any monsters ignored the shield wall and headed towards the back, he’d protect Dwaki, the most vulnerable member of the team.
“It’s Zeal! Be careful!”
“Dwaki! Stay behind me.”
“I will!”
As one Orc Warrior entered a state of [Zeal] and ignored us, charging towards Dwaki, Rotmiller pulled out his shield and blocked it.
Of course, he didn’t have the physical ability to defeat an Orc Warrior in a one-on-one match…
“Whoa, that was close!”
All he had to do was buy some time using his primary weapon, the crossbow, buckler, dagger, and fire bombs.
Then either Misha could provide support, or Dwaki could use magic to attack.
“[Orc Warrior slain. EXP+2]”
“[Orc Archer slain. EXP+2]”
“[Orc Shaman slain. EXP+2]”
Thus, the first battle with the orcs ended smoothly. It took about eight minutes, and there were no injuries, but the time spent in combat was longer than expected.
‘We definitely lack damage output.’
We have a scout and two shield warriors.
And orcs have high physical resistance among 8th level monsters.
Of course, the mage, who is undoubtedly the most powerful dealer in this world, is on the team.
But Dwaki isn't from a magic tower.
His 8th level offensive spell is simply [Ice Shard], which only inflicts damage on a single monster.
‘Well, he was brought here for his curse magic, not his offensive magic.’
The value of a mage doesn’t lie solely in high-powered offensive magic.
There's the concept of a matchup between adventurers and monsters.
However, having a mage on the team allows you to actively engage in combat against a wider range of monsters.
‘It's slow, but it's very stable…’
Despite some drawbacks, our team is pretty good overall.
“Let's go deeper.”
We continued our journey towards the heart of the Orc Encampment, engaging in battles along the way.
The more we went, the more the number of orcs appearing as a group increased. Once, there was even a level 7 monster called ‘Orc Champion’, but…
“[Orc Champion slain. EXP+3]”
We managed to hunt them down without any trouble.
However, crappy situations always arise when everything seems to be going smoothly.
It was when we had settled in and were diligently hunting down Orc groups.
“Ihenero Teuntain.”
Suddenly, a deep voice chanted from beyond the forest, in the distance.
And then—
Kaboom—!
A fireball fell from the sky, obliterating the Orc group we were about to hunt.
“…What the hell?”
What kind of bullshit situation is this?
