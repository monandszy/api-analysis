Chapter 21 Level Up (1)
The chieftain's eyes narrowed, menacingly so.
“Where did you hear about soul inscription? It’s not something young warriors should know.”
Of course, the source of my knowledge is the game.
There’s no way a veteran like me wouldn’t know something so simple.
But I boldly replied,
“I read it in a book.”
I had already confirmed that this information is readily available in the library, so I had nothing to fear.
“The book said that soul inscription was instrumental in the war against the fairies during the Holy Artifact War—”
“Hahahahahahaha!”
The chieftain burst into laughter, cutting me off.
Honestly, I was scared shitless, but his laugh sounded almost delighted, so I couldn’t back down.
“You read it in a book? That’s truly amusing! First Ainarr, and now you, two such remarkable lads in one go!”
Thankfully, the chieftain seemed to be favorably impressed by these studious young barbarians.
“…If what the book says is true, I want to receive the inscription.”
“Certainly, we have no reason to refuse a warrior’s request for a soul inscription! But young warrior, there’s one problem!”
“Problem?”
“It costs a lot of money.”
What? I was worried for nothing.
Why is he being so serious about something so obvious?
Soul inscriptions require expensive materials.
For higher-grade inscriptions, many were only available if you had the materials, not money.
“Hahaha! It’s commendable that you read a book and came here, but you seem to have overlooked that part!”
“I have money. How much is it?”
The chieftain looked at me and said with an endearing smile,
“The cost for the Undying Inscription is, hmm, about 800,000 stones!”
I frowned.
Ugh, it’s 150,000 stones more expensive than the game.
But I can still manage to pay.
“I’ll pay.”
“What?”
“Are you sure?”
The chieftain and Ainarr exclaimed in unison.
Before they could give me a hard time, I opened my pouch and pulled out one 500,000 stone and three 100,000 stone pieces.
The chieftain’s eyes were filled with question marks.
“Bjorn, son of Yandell, where did you get so much money?”
I knew he would ask.
I’d even planned out the scenario in advance.
I told him a story about what happened with Erwen, embellishing it a bit. I told him that I met a fairy on the first floor, treated her like a slave, and by chance, she yielded an essence, and I received money as compensation from the elf.
“Hahahahahahaha! What a delight, those pointy-eared bastards!”
“To rob those vile elves! You’re the first one to do that! Bjorn, son of Yandell!”
The barbarians seemed to love this story, even more than I expected.
The chieftain and Ainarr, as well as the elder who was far away, came closer and were beaming with smiles.
Is there really that much pent-up resentment?
“Hahaha! I can’t remember the last time I laughed like this!”
The chieftain immediately took 600,000 stones from my hand.
What? Wasn’t it 800,000 stones a moment ago…?
I tilted my head, and the chieftain patted my shoulder.
“A gift for a young warrior with such great potential!”
My shoulder felt like it had been dislocated, but the reward was truly sweet.
Damn, 200,000 stones just like that!
Our chieftain is a true barbarian, fiery indeed.
I exclaimed with sincerity,
“I’ll become an even greater warrior by exploiting those pointy-eared bastards wherever I see them!!”
“I have high hopes for you! Bjorn, son of Yandell, young warrior!”
Is this what it means to find someone charming?
I’m starting to like the barbarians more and more.
***
Soul inscription is a kind of strengthening technique.
Its principle is to infuse the body with ‘soul power’ imbued in magical materials, granting special abilities.
It’s also the reason why all barbarians are tattooists.
They have to get tattoos while they are still babies, when their souls are relatively pure, so that they can still see the soul circuit as adults?
That’s how it was set up, anyway.
“I’ll give you one more chance to reconsider. Choosing this path will prevent you from receiving other soul inscriptions. Are you sure you want to go through with it?”
“Of course.”
I know all the paths.
So, I won’t be changing my mind.
The higher-grade inscription of the Undying path contains the core of my training method, and even if it didn’t, all the abilities of the Undying path are mostly high-performance.
“The elder has arrived, so you can go now.”
“I will.”
After Ainarr left, the chieftain took me to the shaman’s tent.
And the procedure officially began.
“Hmm, your circuit is very clean. If you continue to maintain a pure heart, the spirits will bestow great strength upon you.”
The shaman, who was blindfolded, muttered something incomprehensible and poked a needle into the tattoo on my upper body.
And…
“Khhhrrr…!”
“Young warrior, don’t hold back, feel free to scream. Everyone does.”
“AAAAAHHHHH!”
The pain felt like ten times the amount of a potion.
Damn it, I thought it was just a simple tattoo.
Do I have to endure this pain every time I go for a higher path?
“Alright, it’s done. You must be exhausted, go.”
When the shaman finally uttered the words I had been waiting for, it was already dark.
The chieftain who brought me here was nowhere to be seen.
“Thank you.”
“Kkk, this is the first time a warrior has thanked the shaman.”
What? Did I do something wrong?
I don’t know, but I left the tent quickly before I got in trouble.
「Undying Inscription Stage 1 activated. Natural regeneration significantly increased.」
「Physical stats increased by +20.」
Mentally, I was incredibly exhausted, but strangely, my body felt full of energy.
Is this the power of the soul?
It’s a very strange feeling. It’s like I can feel some unknown power in my body.
I’ll have to check it out later.
“Open the gate!”
I left the sacred ground and returned to the inn, tested my newly acquired abilities a few times, and then immediately fell asleep.
***
Another day passed, and morning came.
I went back to the commercial district, the one I visited with Erwen the other day.
I wanted to invest the remaining 900,000 stones I got from the chieftain’s generous discount.
“You’re the one who came here last time. Are you selling again?”
“No, I’m here to buy.”
I need a new weapon.
I sold the hammer I got from the old man last time.
It wasn’t a bad weapon to use, but the handle was too long to use as a one-handed weapon.
“I’d like to see some one-handed blunt weapons.”
“One-handed blunt weapons…”
After sparring with Ainarr, I decided that blunt weapons suited me better than edged weapons.
Swordsmanship requires skill.
Well, I’m not saying I can’t learn, but…
After all, the weapon itself will only be useful in the early stages, so it’s inefficient. I’m planning on focusing solely on shields once I get that ‘essence’, anyway.
“Hmm.”
The clerk scanned me and showed me a one-handed blunt weapon that didn’t look like a one-handed blunt weapon at all.
Even the lightest one was three times heavier than the two-handed hammer the old man used.
But this is a one-handed blunt weapon?
“These are all one-handed blunt weapons favored by barbarians.”
Ah, they’ll probably love this.
My shield is also made of solid steel, a ridiculously heavy piece of equipment.
But…
“I want something a bit more ordinary.”
“Understood.”
There’s no need to buy something so massive.
Such a weapon would undoubtedly increase my destructive power several times over, but…
I’m already one-shotting most monsters on the first floor.
I’m not going to be fighting giant monsters anytime soon, so it would be more of a hindrance than a help to have a weapon like that.
“What about these?”
The clerk brought out new weapons.
Of course, they were also out of the ordinary, but they would fit perfectly with a barbarian’s physique.
I chose a mace of a reasonably ludicrous size.
“How much is this?”
“250,000 stones.”
250,000?
I sold 6 people’s weapons last time, and it only amounted to 350,000 stones.
I frowned, and the clerk added,
“It’s not difficult to make, but it has a high steel content, so it can’t be helped.”
Ah, that makes sense.
I understood.
Although not without complaining.
“I’ll buy it if you reduce the price to 220,000 stones.”
The clerk looked at me with curious eyes when I tried to bargain.
…What kind of life do those barbarian bastards live that they’re so gullible?
“Anyway, these weapons don’t sell that well.”
“Barbarians often come looking for them.”
Well, maybe if they hadn’t shown me the first one.
The barbarians I know wouldn’t pick something as ambiguous as this.
Most importantly, barbarians prefer edged weapons like axes rather than blunt weapons.
I added those points, and the clerk easily agreed to the bargain, almost disheartened.
“Alright, I’ll sell it to you for 220,000 stones.”
…Should’ve asked for 200,000?
「Overall item level increased by +85.」
Anyway, I continued walking around and bought two more pieces of equipment.
The first one is a half-armor.
「Overall item level increased by +57.」
Imagine a bulletproof vest made of flat steel, and you’ll get the picture. It cost 360,000 stones, and I was able to get it cheap because I found one that fit me perfectly.
I probably would have paid double if it was custom-made.
The second item was a helmet.
“It’ll take about 3 days. Leave your address, and I’ll send someone to deliver it.”
Helmets need to fit perfectly on your head, so there was no way around a custom order.
I negotiated a relatively cheap price of 170,000 stones by giving up on the design completely.
「Overall item level increased by +47」
As a result, I had about 50,000 stones left.
…I won’t be able to afford meat for a while.
***
My daily routine is set.
Wake up at 7 am.
Then have breakfast with Erwen.
“Wow, they have potatoes in the stew today!”
“But why do you always eat breakfast here?”
“Because it’s delicious and cheap.”
After breakfast, head straight to the library.
If I walk slowly, I can get there by 8 am and go in as soon as it opens.
“Parshityev.”
I’m getting used to getting magic from this perpetually exhausted female librarian.
“Then good luck.”
“….”
Of course, I’ve never had a proper conversation with her.
Grrr-!
I read until 4 pm, then eat a quick meal at a restaurant I’ve never been to before.
Hmm, this place is expensive and tasteless.
There are a lot of explorers here, so it’s good for eavesdropping.
“Is Ainarr still there?”
“Indeed! I’ll take his place until he gets back!”
I finish my meal and head to the barbarian dormitory, arriving around 5 pm.
Since the 7th day of training, I started sparring with other barbarians.
I fought fiercely with them, taking off my shirt, swinging my fists, and choking them, just like them.
It was far from the systematic martial arts techniques I expected, but…
Sparring with barbarians, whose instincts and intuition are highly developed, ultimately benefited me greatly.
I’m a barbarian too.
「Repeated training slightly improves reflexes.」
「Repeated training slightly improves flexibility.」
「Repeated training improves… 」
「Physical stats increased by +1.」
I’m starting to get a feel for how to use this body.
“Bjorn, son of Yandell, wins!!”
“He’s the strongest warrior ever!!”
Even without my new equipment, I sometimes won sparring matches against Ainarr.
He’s definitely skilled, but he has the disadvantage of a predictable pattern.
I offered advice, but it’s become so ingrained as a habit that he can’t seem to break it easily.
“I’m tired! I’m going to sleep!”
“Me too!”
“A wise warrior knows when to rest!”
The sparring sessions, which feel like real battles, end around 9 pm.
Then I return to the dormitory, my body covered in sweat and dirt.
By the time I get back from showering, Erwen is there again.
“Old man! Hurry up and shower! The food will get cold!”
“Alright.”
Not every day, but five times a week, we meet for dinner and chat.
Most of the conversation is about Erwen’s day, what she did, and how she felt. It’s just silly everyday stuff.
“Don’t you get tired of walking for an hour every time?”
“Not at all? The food here is cheap and delicious!”
Cheap and delicious?
I don’t understand why she doesn’t just eat at her own place with her rich sister.
“Thank you for the meal!”
We finish our meal around 11 pm.
By this time, Erwen willingly returns to her dorm.
“Then good night. Oh, and I can’t come tomorrow either.”
“You wouldn’t have been able to see me anyway. We’ll be busy tomorrow.
That was my daily routine, which repeated itself.
I checked the time and quickly went up to my room and collapsed onto the bed.
A month has already passed.
And…
[23 : 41]
About 24 hours left until the Labyrinth opens.
