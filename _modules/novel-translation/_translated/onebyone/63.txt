Chapter 63: The Hut (2)
Day 8 of our ordeal. We had been wandering aimlessly through the Witch's Forest, surprisingly not encountering any other groups of explorers. Considering the nature of the area, we should have crossed paths at least once…
But on closer inspection, it wasn't that peculiar.
The Witch's Forest was vast. It wasn't a primary hunting ground, so the resident population was small. We were simply wandering haphazardly, not heading towards the core. The likelihood of a chance encounter was naturally low.
"By this point, anyone who needed to pass through would have done so already."
Still, I expected some explorers aiming for the 4th floor to appear when the time came for the 3rd floor to close. It's common practice to scout the area slightly before ascending a floor.
"So they're also aiming for the 4th floor?"
It seemed likely. Of course, this didn't mean we could trust them.
"A Barbarian and a Beastkin? You two are alone?"
Just as I had assessed them upon seeing them, they had assessed us. It would be natural to be curious. A team of two, not on the 1st or 2nd floor, but the 3rd, venturing through the Witch's Forest…
The man who seemed to be the leader of the five-person team reached a conclusion.
"...Are you two separated from your team?"
"That's right."
I admitted it readily. A bluff was fine, but only when there was something to gain. In our pathetic state, denying it would only make us look suspicious. What would be the point of insisting on something false?
Of course, I needed to be cautious, regardless.
"Ugh! Bjorn! Are we finally saved?"
"Be quiet."
Pushing Misha back, who was already getting excited, I blocked her path. I discreetly raised my shield.
"Don't be so wary. We're not bad people."
A middle-aged human woman stepped forward from the other side, her face alight with a reassuring smile at my gesture…
"We have children in the city just like you. I understand your worries, but please, you must be tired… come, let me—"
"Declined."
Children?
What did it matter?
It actually made them seem more dangerous. Having children to feed meant they had a stronger need to earn money.
"B-Bjorn, why are you doing this? Maybe they can help us…"
"Quiet."
I had given much thought to how to act when encountering explorers. My conclusion was to ask for help.
With a promise of some sort of reward, requesting they guide us outside the forest would be a reasonable trade for them. However...
"To make a deal, I need to know who they are first."
I needed to verify their identities.
"I am Bjorn, son of Yandell."
"A cautious friend you are. I'm Hans Stobraine. I'm the scout in our team."
When I revealed my name, the leader of the other side reciprocated with his. But the problem was…
"Your name… is Hans?"
"Ha, it's a common name."
"I suppose so."
Why were there so many Hans in this world?
First point deducted for a name that felt ominous.
"I'm Anuman Bate. We run a general store with my husband in the city—"
I cut off the woman as she began to divulge her personal information.
"We don't need to know that."
There was no way to verify the truth of her words in this labyrinth, and we didn't have much time.
To take their help or not.
No matter which choice we made, we needed to decide quickly.
"Two warriors, two archers, one scout."
I quickly scanned them from head to toe, assessing their approximate strength as well as their faces, expressions, tones, and general aura.
Of course, there was no need for a detailed examination. Sometimes, intuition made the most accurate judgments. The accumulated experience and data buried in the subconscious.
"Misha."
Finally, I made my decision. There was no guarantee it was the right one…
"You'll follow my lead?"
I didn't need to explain much. To my concise question, Misha replied succinctly.
"Of course."
Good, I had her agreement.
"Let's call it a day on introductions. We're leaving."
"Leaving? You need our help, don't you?"
That's true, but somehow my instincts are screaming that you're dangerous.
"I've reconsidered. We don't need it. Come on, Misha, let's go."
"Oh, okay!"
"Hmm, if you say so. No need to stop you then. Be on your way."
Alright, I've gotten their consent.
Using my shield to cover my body, I slowly backed away, my eyes still fixed on them.
It was then.
Whiz-!
I heard the familiar sound of something piercing the air. Before my brain could process it, my body reacted.
Whizz-!
I twisted my neck to the side, a single arrow narrowly missing my ear.
Damn it, how did they do that?
The arrow came from behind. The bastards who shot it were in front of us.
"Ms. Bate, what are you doing!"
One of the other party, an old woman who was an archer, was being yelled at.
This wasn't a mutual agreement, was it?
The woman who claimed to have children in the city no longer spoke softly.
"You fools! Haven't you seen the equipment he has? It's made of Lightinium! Do you even know how much it's worth?"
"B-but, we're fellow explorers…"
"Little one, if you can't handle it, you can sit this one out. See that backpack? It's an expandable backpack. You'd have to work your bones off for a year to afford that."
Did she really run a general store with her husband?
This woman has good taste.
I didn't have the guts to compliment her though.
"I, I can't do it."
"Then anyone who doesn't want to participate can leave."
"I'm in. This isn't the first time. I'm not in a good enough situation to pass up easy money."
The explorers, who were originally colleagues, quickly came to an agreement.
I watched the scene silently.
Misha nervously tugged at my collar.
"B-Bjorn… shouldn't we escape?"
"Wait."
There's a scout on their side. If we run like this, we won't get far.
"It's almost time…."
"Dee, in, da…"
"Here they come."
I smiled wryly. The sole reason I wanted to make a decision quickly, whether it was life or death.
As the Carnibaros emerged from the darkness, the group of explorers who were about to ambush us flinched.
"C-Carnibaros?"
"Why are there two of them at the same time…."
Well, we're on day 8 of our ordeal. You may be just entering, but we've already reached level 10 of "The Witch's Eye."
"Misha, now."
I wrapped my arm around Misha. With my other hand, I held up my shield and charged forward, not backward.
「The Carnibaro used [Pursuit Arrow].」
「The Carnibaro used [Pursuit Arrow].」
I saw the Carnibaro on the right stringing its bow.
I spurred myself forward, pushing through.
Whiz-whiz-!
The Barbarian's superhuman eyesight recognized that two arrows were being shot simultaneously. But there was no need to worry about my empty back. 
Something was going to block them for me now.
"A-ack! Block it!"
"What the hell are they!"
As I rammed into the other party with the Barbarian's brute force, I heard a scream from the side. It was the little one who couldn't handle it.
"Aaaagh!"
Well, you got hit, didn't you?
Good people always go first.
Kaboom-!
"Agh! Damn it, my leg!!"
There was an explosion from the direction of the Carnibaros, seemingly following each other. Checking quickly, I saw that Hans D, who had been taken aback by my charge, had stepped on a magical mine by accident.
"Mr. Stobraine!!"
Okay.
It seems the aggro is fully on their side now.
"Misha, run."
I let go of Misha.
I didn't look back and ran forward.
"What are you all doing! The bastards are taken care of, deal with the monsters—"
This should buy us some time to get away.
***
"[Dungeon & Stone]" is a roguelike game. Once you die, that's it. Your character is gone.
Of course, it's just a game, ultimately. You can just create a new character, get new equipment…
After all, the main content of this game is using the information you learned from previous playthroughs to reach higher floors.
Death is a daily occurrence in "[Dungeon & Stone]". But what if that game world was real?
Character regeneration is impossible. No matter what you see, hear, or learn in this life, it's meaningless the moment you die.
And in that sense…
"But Bjorn, how did you know? That they'd do that…"
"Gut feeling."
I was lucky this time. I followed the judgment of my unconscious mind, and it turned out to be right.
Misha, having realized the truth, couldn't contain her astonishment.
"...Gut feeling?"
Somehow, she seemed to think there was a clear reason for my actions, unlike earlier when she agreed to follow me without question.
"The leader's name was Hans, wasn't it?"
"Yeah, so?"
"I don't like that name."
"..."
"Anyway, we escaped safely thanks to you. That's what matters."
"That's true, but…"
Misha trailed off, looking slightly uneasy. She changed the subject.
"Anyway, I never would have guessed that nice-looking lady would change so quickly…"
The image of the woman, her face twisted in malicious intent, screaming at us, made Misha shiver slightly. It seemed her rapid transformation had been quite a shock to her.
I spoke, not sure if it would be of any comfort.
"She might have been a truly kind person."
"Huh? What do you mean—"
"If we hadn't seemed weak."
Or if we hadn't been carrying valuable items. If we had met in the city instead of the labyrinth…
She might have remained a kind figure in our memories. 
But she had been quicker than anyone else to string her bow and draw an arrow.
"She wasn't kind because we seemed weak? I don't get it…"
"Misha, why did you enter the labyrinth?"
"Because I need to earn money…"
"They're the same."
Money is a means of protection. Especially in this world, where not paying taxes is a death sentence. She probably had many things besides her own life to protect.
"...I feel like I'm learning a lot on this exploration."
"Then move faster. They might be tracking us."
I increased our pace.
How long had it been?
Contrary to our fears, they hadn't appeared for over an hour.
"They probably didn't all get taken out by two Carnibaros, even after getting ambushed… Something must have happened to them?"
That was the most logical assumption. Perhaps Hans, the scout who stepped on the magical mine, was seriously injured and hindering their pursuit.
Whatever the reason, we had successfully overcome a crisis.
"Please, let this be the end."
I steeled myself, even as I wished for it.
The most insidious thing comes when you let your guard down.
***
Day 13 of our ordeal.
The time was 7:00 PM. To be exact, 53 hours remained before the labyrinth closed.
"Bjorn, I found it!"
We had discovered a tree leading to the hut. The light coming from it was slightly faded, suggesting it had been formed quite some time ago…
But this was it.
"It's done."
We had somehow avoided the worst-case scenario. Even four hours of rest would be enough to mentally endure the remaining two days. In other words, our chances of returning safely had skyrocketed.
「The character enters the Witch's Hut.」
Every second of rest was precious, so I immediately placed my hand on the hut and entered.
The scenery beyond was the same as before. 
The scent of grass and flowers filled the air. The sound of crickets chirping peacefully. The rustling of leaves in the wind.
"Damn it…"
Sadly, something out of place marred this idyllic scene.
「Current occupants: 5」
「The entrance is closing.」
Previous occupants.
In other words, others had found this hut before us.
"Bjorn."
"Shh."
I covered Misha's mouth and quickly scanned the area with my eyes.
"One on the bed, one on the chair, one on the grass."
From the window, I couldn't see everything inside, but…
There were three people, at least. The hut had a maximum occupancy of five.
"This is a headache."
I slowly approached the man sleeping on the grass. At that moment…
As if mumbling in his sleep, the man turned his back to us.
I froze.
"I didn't expect to see this face again here…"
To my surprise, it was a familiar face.
