Chapter 10: Night Companion (3)
Strictly speaking, the word 'we' is not quite right.
It wasn't me who caught the attention of the chubby and skinny duo, but Erwen.
I kicked Erwen's foot again.
"Ugh... "
Ugh, what? Get up quickly. I know you're not sleeping. I saw you sneakily check when you heard their voices and cover your face with a blanket.
"Eeek!"
There was no time for squabbling, so I grabbed her shoulder and forcefully pulled her up.
"Why are you pretending to be asleep?"
"Well... "
Erwen trailed off, avoiding my gaze.
It was a frustrating attitude for me, who needed to get information and make a decision as quickly as possible.
Flick.
I grabbed her chin and forced her to look at me. Erwen reluctantly spoke.
"If I wake up, you'll leave... "
So that was it.
I had made a vow. I swore to fight alongside her if a conflict arose between us and the explorers while guarding the area. Unfortunately, this incident happened on the last shift I had promised.
Well, I didn't care about honor anyway...
She didn't know that.
So she tried to hold on as long as possible.
Because the moment she opened her eyes, the Night Companion vow would be over.
"Whew."
I let out a deep sigh.
If a grown man like Hans had done this, I would have been furious.
But since she was only 20 years old, a sense of pity arose first.
Of course, that's that, and this is this.
"What happened with those two?"
"Nothing."
"Then why were you hiding?"
"... The symbol on their clothes was the same as that of the man who tried to harm me. They're definitely part of the same group."
A group... Damn, the situation is getting worse!
I even started to wonder if it would be better to just part ways with this fairy girl and go our separate ways.
"Let's talk while we move."
"Are you going to help me?"
"Let me hear the rest of the story."
First, I took Erwen away from where she was hiding.  Then, I ran almost all the way, getting a grasp of the remaining situation.
"Tell me everything that happened."
Erwen, sensing the urgency, spoke briefly, giving me only the most important information.
"The first night, the person I met as a Night Companion tried to attack me while I was asleep.  Later, I found out he was a high-ranking member of a group that uses the first floor as their main territory."
By the way, the name of that group was the 'Crystal Alliance'.
"I managed to escape, but after that, people from the same group attacked me whenever they saw me. I got injured then."
I paused.
"Wait, how did they know about that?"
"Message Stone."
What the hell is that? There was no such thing in the game I played.
"Tell me more."
"It's a magical tool that allows you to communicate with other Message Stones that have been pre-resonated. I heard the range is about 300 meters."
"I see."
It's a kind of walkie-talkie. If you pre-tune the frequency, you can communicate within a 300-meter radius.
The situation was slowly becoming clear.
If they have such magical tools and a large number of people, information transmission would be easy even in this closed environment.
However, the problem is...
"Why are they going to such lengths to chase you?"
Erwen has done nothing wrong.
Why are they going to such lengths to hunt down the victim?
"Is it because they want to silence you?"
"... It's not just that."
"There's more?"
"Well... "
Erwen hesitated again, despite being asked a direct question. If this is her attitude, I have no way to help.
Just as I was thinking that...
"I, I swung my knife at him while I was escaping. But it happened to hit the wrong place..."
"... The wrong place?"
It feels cold.
A chill keeps running down my crotch.
"Th, th, th, there... you know... ?"
It's real.
"Ahem, anyway, when I heard the stories from the people chasing me, they said they had to cut it off and couldn't even reattach it with a potion... So I think it's because of that..."
It's understandable they'd go crazy chasing her.
"I, I, I'm sorry..."
There's nothing to apologize for.
It was the guy who did wrong, wasn't it? Karma. The problem is that there are too many people in the world who don't even understand this simple logic.
"Boss, I think we're being tracked."
"What?"
"Don't look back."
I tried to focus my hearing, but I couldn't hear anything unusual.
"The distance... I think they're about 150 meters behind us."
It's strange that I can feel their presence at such a distance, but she doesn't seem to be lying. There's no reason for her to lie either.
So is this her innate sense?
Suddenly, she seems different.
"We need to speed up. Are you okay?"
"Yes. I can still hold on."
Even though the bandage had turned red from the wound opening, Erwen didn't groan.
She has a good spirit.
Well, my mind is racing, but...
"How far is the pursuer?"
"... Still about 150 meters."
Even though we increased our speed, the distance is not widening.
The situation is not good.
By now, the pursuers must be informing their comrades of our location using the Message Stone or whatever.
We have to take them down.
If their target was me, I would have definitely made that judgment.
But I'm still running.
If I kill them, I can never back out.
So let's check before I get involved.
"Bo, Boss... ?"
How much risk do I have to take, and what can I gain in return?
I need more detailed information.
"Erwen."
"Yes, yes?"
"What are you good at?"
"I'm good at laundry and cleaning. I, I'm not good at cooking, but..."
What is she talking about?
"When I said combat."
"... Archery, archery! Oh, and spirit magic!"
Typical fairy archer.
"What attribute?"
"... Fire."
Hmm, the most valuable attribute.
Thanks to that, a picture is starting to form.
"Have you ever killed a person?"
"No... But I can."
You have to try it to find out.
"I see."
I asked her one final question.
"Erwen, will you be my companion?  The period will be until we get out of the maze, and the spoils will be divided 9 for me and 1 for you."
"I, I will!"
Now, I have a reason too.
***
" â€”I swear on the name of my clan."
"I also vow by the honor of a warrior."
As before, we left our mark as a sign of trust, evolving our relationship from a one-night Night Companion to temporary allies.
Of course, while running like crazy.
"How far are they?"
"About 100 meters!"
Even at our maximum speed, the distance is closing.
I made up my mind.
"We're going to the outskirts."
"Yes!"
We changed directions and entered a dark passage.
The shining crystals on the walls and ceiling became fewer and fewer, and soon a thick darkness enveloped us.
My heart is heavy.
Ugh, I never thought I'd come back here of my own accord.
"Erwen, summon a spirit."
A watermelon-sized flame appeared on her palm, illuminating the surroundings. I moved quickly, carefully navigating the darkness.
And...
"Dismiss the summon."
I hid in the darkness.
"Any sign?"
"You'll be able to hear it soon."
"I see."
I focused on my hearing, trying to stay calm.
The best-case scenario would be for the pursuers to miss us.
Then, we wouldn't have to kill them, and I could back out later.
Thud, thud, thud, thud.
Soon, I could hear the pursuer's footsteps as well.
But contrary to my expectations, his steps did not pass by; they stopped.
Right at the fork we took.
Thud.
Damn it...
It seems like he has a way to track us. Smell, sound, or maybe something magical.
Thump, thump.
He changed direction, walked slowly, and stopped about 30 meters away from us.
The boundary of the abyssal darkness.
"... "
He stuck his head out and peered into it.
We watched him, holding our breath.
"Here you are."
The man muttered to himself, sniffing a few times in the silent stillness.
And then he pulled something out of his pocket.
It was something I had never seen before, but I instinctively knew what it was.
The Message Stone.
Seeing it, I sent a signal, briefly whispering.
To Erwen, who had been holding back an arrow, ready to shoot.
"Shoot."
Whoosh.
Before I even finished speaking, the arrow shot out and pierced the man's forehead.
Thump.
Even though the man collapsed to the ground, I didn't rush out.
"... "
I could feel an uncontrollable tremor from Erwen, who was right next to me.
"Good job. You would have been in danger if you had hesitated."
It's not just empty praise, but genuine.
Didn't I also hesitate when I brought down my shield on the boss? Erwen had no time for hesitation, not even a moment ago.
She must know it herself, even if I don't tell her.
That she should never hesitate.
"Y, yes... "
"You rest for a while."
With that reassurance, I left the darkness and searched the corpse.
He was carrying a fairly simple pack, probably because he had left his backpack with another comrade for faster movement.
'To feel regret in a place like this... I guess I've become one of them too.'
First, I stripped the pursuer of all his equipment, from head to toe. Then, I organized the items I had obtained one by one.
A belt, a leather upper and lower garment, two daggers, a fairly heavy stone bag, a potion in a pocket that was attached to the belt, and a Message Stone.
"Good. Come here."
After roughly sorting through the items, I called for Erwen.
Then, I removed the bandage and used a potion to heal her wound.
Sizzle, the wound began to heal, accompanied by the sound.
"Ugh... "
It's okay to make noise, but Erwen gritted her teeth and endured.
She has a tough side too.  Or is she just mentally broken?
I hope it's the former. I'm not good at counseling.
"Are you feeling a little better?"
"Yes. A lot better."
"Then change into this."
After a few minutes of treatment, I handed her the leather upper and lower garment I had just acquired.
I decided that it was much more practical than her flowing cloth clothes.
"I'll change right away."
Did she think that following my judgment would increase her chances of survival?  It would be understandable if she felt uncomfortable, but Erwen immediately took the clothes and went into the darkness to change.
"There's some leftover. Come here."
I used my own arms and legs to cut the parts that stuck out.
"Wear this too. It will help a little."
It looks a little baggy overall, but it looks much more comfortable with the belt on.
But because she's wearing different clothes, her whole vibe has changed.
Before, she was a fairy girl out for a stroll. Now, she looks like a proper female warrior.
Even her expression.
"... It feels really strange."
"You'll get used to it."
"I, I guess... ?"
"Yeah, you will."
I stuffed the rest of the items into my backpack and dragged the naked corpse into the darkness to hide it.
Then I held the Message Stone in my hand.
"How do you use this?"
"Just a moment. Let me try."
Erwen looked at the Message Stone and pressed something.
[... The connection with Serdin, who was pursuing the fairy girl and the barbarian, has been lost. Anyone receiving this message, gather at the Goblin Earth.]
So far, it's going according to my plan.
