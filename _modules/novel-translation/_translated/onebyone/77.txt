Chapter 77: Request (1)
Fifteen days had passed since I returned alive from the Labyrinth. In other words, about two weeks remained until the portal in the Dimensional Plaza would open again.  It wasn't quite accurate to say I had a good rest. Time just flew by as I diligently carried out my daily tasks, like homework.  Well, I wasn't the only one who was busy.
"Ha ha ha! Isn't this the famous Little Balkan, Bjorn, son of Yandell! If you're free later, how about a drink downstairs—?"
"I'm tired."
Except for the dwarf, who had been living like a bum for the past two weeks, all the members of the Half-Penny team had spent their days busily. First, Rothmiller.
"Hmm, I think I'm starting to understand. How to use the "Intuition" stat. This time, in the exploration, he absorbed the essence of a mimic and was dedicated to practicing every day to get used to his new ability.
Dwarki was the same.
"...Ah, me you say? Don't mind me. I just haven't slept for a couple of days."
His financial problems solved, he had been cutting down on sleep and learning new spells from the Magic Tower.  Once, the dwarf had worried that he was overworking himself...
"Who knows what might happen in the next exploration? I need to prepare as much as I can while I have the chance."
This is commendable. When did this guy become so responsible? I'm glad he stayed in this team.  Even though he ate the essence of an Orc Hero, with this kind of general leveling up, I don't think he'll be holding us back.
"From the next exploration onwards, we should be able to reach the 4th floor without any problems."
Growth wasn't limited to them.  Over the past two weeks, Misha and I had also undergone significant changes. Let me start with myself...
"Ha ha ha! Congratulations. You acquired a 'Name' in just three months and got promoted to a 6th Rank Explorer? You're making me worry that I'll be left behind soon!"
"If you're worried, why don't you try putting in some effort?"
"I'm already looking for some good equipment to buy!"
A few days ago, I was promoted to a 6th Rank Explorer. Contrary to my expectations, going straight to 5th Rank was impossible.  From 5th Rank onwards, there was an exam, and apparently, to take the exam, you had to accumulate a certain amount of merit by completing requests submitted to the Guild.
"Ugh, they didn't have this in the game."
Actually, it's getting old to complain now.  The game's background was about 150 years before the present. Over a century, there would have been countless updates to this social system. Like the library, which was only displayed as 'under construction' in the game.
"Oh, is this the new weapon you bought? Just looking at it, it looks reliable."
There were some upgrades in the equipment area.  First, I bought a new mace to replace the one I lost.  By the way, the price was 400,000 stones, more than double the cost of my previous one.  Well, that's because it was made with more steel.
"Your overall item level has increased by +185."
The size and weight were overwhelming.  However, since my strength had increased significantly this time, there were no problems with actual use.
"Speaking of which, Ms. Karlstain was talking about getting new weapons too, what happened to that?"
"Ah, that? I don't want to talk about it, ask this one."
Misha pointed at me in response to Dwarki's question.  Hmph, I thought we were done with the grumbling...
"I bought dual swords."
I had changed Misha's weapon a few days ago.  Twin swords with a reach of about 70% of the standard longsword size.  I got them from the forge that Hikuroad told me about, for 550,000 stones.
"Dual swords?"
The dwarf and Rothmiller mumbled simultaneously, and Misha seized the opportunity to whine.
"Right? It sounds weird, doesn't it?"
"Weird? It seems like there might be a misunderstanding."
"Huh?"
"You see, the reason I was surprised just now was that it was exactly the same as what I thought to myself before.  It's good that you're ambidextrous and can use both hands, but I wondered if there was a reason you insisted on using daggers."
"...What are you saying?"
"If it were against people, it would be different. But we mostly fight monsters, don't we? We'll be encountering large monsters more and more from now on."
In short, it meant that I had been slightly regretting using the short daggers before, but it was good that she had changed.  
Misha looked at the dwarf in confusion, as it wasn't the response she had expected.  However...
"Dual swords… it's not a bad choice, indeed. After all, we'll be holding the front lines tight, right? Ha ha ha!"
The dwarf, in his tank position, was simply satisfied with the fact that the close-range dealer had invested in all-attack.
At that moment, Dwarki spoke up.
"I'm no expert in that area, but adapting to wielding a new weapon, especially two at once, seems like it would be difficult…"
"That's right! That's exactly what I was trying to say!  I'm not sure about this, I might even get beaten up by goblins in the next exploration!"
Misha gained strength from Dwarki's agreement and glanced at me. But no matter what, this is all I could say.
"Then practice more. So you don't get beaten up by goblins."
I repeat, the easy path is the slow path.  It may be difficult to build up proficiency with a new weapon right now, but...
In the game, the Freezing Dual Swordsmanship was the strongest close-range dealer in the late game.  Because it had one ridiculously overpowered item.
"Ugh, okay, stop nagging me."
"It's not nagging, it's advice for your future."
"That's why it's nagging."
As soon as Misha and I started bickering, Dwarki, clueless as ever, joined in.
"But if you hate it so much, why not just not change your weapon?"
"Huh?"
"I mean, it's not like Bjorn is your parent, you don't have to do what he says. Honestly, watching from the side, it feels like he's overstepping the line."
Overstepping the line?  Well, I guess that's true from an outside perspective...
But there's something he doesn't know.
"It's not that bad, I don't hate it that much. It's difficult now, but there are definitely some advantages compared to using daggers..."
"Oh, is that so?"
"Yeah, so don't say anything too bad to Bjorn. It's my decision."
I'm not forcing her to do anything. I'm just strongly persuading her with valid reasons.
***
"Then, starting with the next exploration, we should aim for the center of the 4th floor. Ha ha ha."
"If possible, I'd like to pass through a place I haven't been to yet when going through the 2nd floor."
"Hmm, is it because of merit? In that case, I should double-check that route again."
As we were organizing our exploration plans over dinner, the weekly regular meeting ended quickly.  Honestly, it's more of a place to meet once a week and talk about our recent activities.  
"Bjorn, are you two going together again this time?"
"We're heading in the same direction, aren't we?"
"Hmm, you two have been getting closer lately."
Well, to me, it looks like you and Dwarki are closer. I ignored the dwarf's foolishness and left the tavern with Misha.
"Oh, right. Bjorn! The equipment you ordered last time is finished, they said to come and get it!"
"It's too late tonight, I'll go get it tomorrow."
"But what did you order that took so long?"
Ah, did I forget to tell her?
"Underwear."
"Hmm, underwear...?"
Of course, it wasn't ordinary underwear. To be precise, it's a piece of equipment called "Egg Guard" in the male explorer slang.  Simply put, it's a groin protector.
"I had to pay a bit more to get it enchanted."
"Eek, what, did you even enchant that!?"
"What do you mean by 'that'?"
"I mean, not that it's not... Well, it's not like you could find a decent one, so I understand... "
What's she on about now?
"I can't just go around naked when my body grows bigger, can I?"
It's the player's role to set up equipment according to the essence they eat.  I made clothes in the shape I wanted in anticipation of the "[Giant Growth]" and enchanted it with "Automatic Repair," "Shape Transformation," and "Acid Immunity."  Well, it wouldn't be possible to find the kind of underwear I want in stores.  It cost about 900,000 stones.
"Ah, that's why you had it enchanted.  I thought... "
Misha took a deep breath as the misunderstanding cleared.  But then, as if she had a question, she asked in a strange voice.
"Um... are you going to wear just that in the Labyrinth from now on?"
"Yes."
I answered boldly.  Earlier, I said "underwear" because I didn't know what else to call it, but it's more like pants that go down to your thighs.  You know, the ones those cyclists wear. And it's not some stretchy material, it's leather, so there's nothing to be ashamed of.  Well, I haven't actually worn it yet...
"..."
It definitely will. I'm a barbarian, aren't I?  I value efficiency over sentiment.  
Anyway, as we were chatting and walking, we soon arrived at the lodging.
"Well, you should go in and sleep too."
"Okay.  Um, should I go with you to get the equipment tomorrow...?"
"Don't try to be cute, go swing your sword while I'm gone."
"I wasn't trying to be cute..."
You were totally trying to be cute.
"It's fine even if you don't.  I have a place to go by myself tomorrow anyway."
"By yourself? Where are you going?"
I answered briefly.
"To the Sanctuary."
I have money now, and I got the essence of an Orc Hero, the key to leveling up.  It's time to start raising my Soul Binding level.
***
I woke up early in the morning and checked my ledger once more.
"Mace, underwear, dual swords, totaling 1,850,000 stones."
The "[Beast's Blood]" I bought to level up Misha's Soul Level was 2,000,000 stones.  The cost of enchanting the Lythinium chestplate and shield with "Acid Immunity" was 510,000 stones.
"If I subtract the 90,000 stones for a month's living expenses... "
I only have 3,700,000 stones left.  
Of course, I spent it all on things I needed, so I'm not upset about it.  The "[Beast's Blood]" cost 2,000,000 stones, but if I hadn't gotten it, it would have taken Misha a long time to be able to imbue her weapon with the freezing attribute.
"...I should have enchanted the equipment earlier."
When I bought the equipment, I had the Frost Phantom Ring, and I didn't have any money left, so I skipped it.  As a result, I spent 500,000 stones on repairs.  Damn, I should have done it earlier, even if I had to scrimp elsewhere...
"Bjorn, son of Yandell!"
I had just finished washing up and walked to the Sanctuary after a while, when the chieftain greeted me.  He had a slightly pleased smile on his face.
"I can't call you a young warrior anymore. You've earned the name 'Little Balkan,' haven't you?"
"That's right!"
I nodded confidently, playing the role of a returning barbarian with honors.  But this is the world of cold barbarians.
"So what brings you here!"
After a few words, the chieftain gets to the point.  Barbaric as always, he's too short on introductions.  Honestly, I thought he would be more impressed, praise me, or even encourage me...
"Well, it's good for me to save time too."
Maybe the most rational race in this city is not the barbarians?  I seriously pondered that question as I immediately stated my purpose.
"I've come to receive the Soul Binding."
"Very well.  I'll summon the shaman, go talk to him."
After that, it was all about speed.  Maybe he had something important to do, the chieftain left, and the shaman's disciple came to guide me to a tent.
As I entered, a shaman with wrinkled skin greeted me.
"Haha, you're back again."
"How did you know it was me?"
"Well, not many warriors come to give thanks to the shaman."
No, I was asking how he recognized me while I had my blindfold on...  
I didn't ask again.  Well, he's a shaman, so he must have some mysterious powers.
"You've come for the second inscription of the Undead Path?"
"That's right."
"The fee is 1,000,000 stones."
I froze in shock.
"1,000,000 stones?"
"Don't tell me you're unprepared?"
"...No, I'm not."
I was just surprised that the price was exactly the same as in the game.  The first stage was 150,000 stones more expensive than in the game.
Jingle.
No matter the minor confusion, I took out the money as instructed and put it in the jar in front of the shaman.
Then the shaman chuckled.
"I'm glad you brought enough this time.  Last time, I lost 50,000 stones, it was a real headache."
"...You lost 50,000 stones? What are you talking about?"
"Young warrior, don't worry about it. It's all the fault of the foolish chieftain."
No, it's bothering me, I said!
Something felt off, so I lay down on the blanket as instructed and asked again.
"Shaman, what was the original price of the first stage inscription...?"
"550,000 stones."
"...I see."
All my doubts were cleared with that one sentence.  The chieftain had quoted a price of 700,000 stones.  Of course, I don't think he was trying to rip me off by quoting that amount.  It's just that I hadn't noticed it at the time.
"[The cost for Undead Inscription surgery is... Well, around 700,000 stones!]"
The chieftain was also just a barbarian.  He was very weak with letters and numbers.
"Ugh, so he was talking about deducting 200,000 stones?"
Well, I did save 50,000 stones in the end, so it's not a loss...
But I'm such an idiot for being genuinely happy about it...
"Then, let's begin."
The moment the needle pierced my skin, all the worries, anxieties, and thoughts that were filling my mind vanished.  It was truly a long-forgotten feeling, a vivid pain.
"Young warrior, don't hold back, feel free to scream—"
"Aaaaaaaaahhhh!!!"
Damn, I thought I was fine now thanks to pain resistance...
No way, this doesn't work?
"...I'll have to get the 3rd stage tomorrow."
It seems I'll need to revise my plans.
***
"The 2nd stage Undead Inscription has been activated. Your Stamina and Demon Resistance have greatly increased."
"Your Body stat has increased by + 20."
"Your Mind stat has increased by + 20."
***
You're saying this is going to be the longest 15 minutes of my life?  How naive I was back then.
"Okay, it's done."
The first stage took 12 hours to get the tattoo, but the second stage only took 10 minutes.  However, the pain was beyond imagination.  It felt like the pain I should have felt over 12 hours was compressed into those 10 minutes.
"Haha, this is the first time I've seen someone still conscious."
The shaman cackled like a psychopath as he watched me, half-fainting.  Then, he thrust something at me.
"Go on, draw one. Since there's still time, I'll steal your fortune for you."
What? Fortune-telling?  In this fantasy world, it seems like the accuracy would be pretty high...
"Fortune-telling is not something grand, so hurry up and choose. I can tell if good things will happen to you in the future or not."
Well, if that's the case.
I didn't sense any malice, so I casually drew one of the dozens of sticks in the container.  The shaman remained silent for a moment.  I'm getting a bad feeling about this.
"Young warrior, what is your birthdate?"
Ah, I didn't expect it to need my horoscope...  
As I pondered how to answer, the shaman cackled again.
"Haha, it's a joke.  How would a warrior know their birthdate?"
"...So, what did you steal about my fortune?"
"It's unusual.  I've seen many warriors' fortunes, but this is the first time I've seen one with so much bad luck."
Hmm, it's exactly what the fortune-teller my mother took me to said.  
I'm really cursed from birth, am I?
"You've probably gone through many hardships that others would only experience once, and you'll continue to do so."
"I see."
Ugh, I shouldn't have done fortune-telling.  I knew it deep down, but when a shaman from a fantasy world says it so decisively, I feel depressed for no reason.
"Don't be discouraged, young warrior.  Your bad luck isn't necessarily a bad thing."
"It's not necessarily bad?"
"Besides bad luck, your fortune also has good fortune that is no less. And if you don't get swallowed by the bad luck, it will eventually turn into good luck."
"What are you saying? Explain it simply."
This time, it wasn't an act of being a barbarian, it was genuine.  Is it a rule in this industry, both on Earth and here, to speak in a way that's hard to understand?
"Haha, it means you'll experience things that would only happen to others once in their lifetime, whether it's good or bad."
I felt a dull ringing in my head.
"It's a fortune that many who are commonly called heroes are born with."
Honestly, I don't know much about heroes.
One thing is for sure.  I've had countless shitty things happen in my life, but in the end, I'm still alive and breathing.
I just thought it was because my bad luck was strong.  But looking back on it now, it's not like only shitty things happened.
"Haha, it seems you're getting it?"
Just looking at the Blood Citadel, it's like that.  I almost died when the Vampire Duke, Cambormier, appeared, but in the end, I got his essence.
The Tier Lord I met recently?  He made a huge fuss, but I got the essence of an Orc Hero in the process.
"If it's a hero's fortune, does that mean I won't die no matter what I go through?"
"Of course not."
The shaman smiled, truly like a pure young warrior.  Then, with a serious expression, he murmured.
"Some are devoured by their fate, some submit to it, and some overcome it."
"Make it easy to understand."
"That depends not on fate, but on you."
Ugh, he's still speaking in riddles.  Fine, fate and all that, it's not going to change anything anyway.  I won't rely on anything, I'll always be alert and do what I have to do.  So I can endure whatever comes my way.
