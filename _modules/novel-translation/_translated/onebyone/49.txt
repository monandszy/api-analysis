Chapter 49: Companions (3)
Slicked-back hair and fine blonde locks.
He was a little over five feet tall, thin and wiry.
An 8th-grade mage capable of administrative and life magic, a few curse spells, and ice magic.
Reol Warb Dwarki.
The more we talked, the stronger the stench of fake hung in the air.
‘Shit, maybe he’s not even a mage at all?’
Suddenly, that suspicion crept in. I cross-checked a few things, but to my surprise, he was indeed a mage. 
And looking back, he hadn't lied.
He only said his uncle was the younger brother of the Baroness, not that he himself was a noble.
Come to think of it, he must know the rules.
Impersonating a noble is a serious crime, punishable by immediate execution with no room for excuses.
“So, what do you say? Are you in?”
After much deliberation, I decided to take him into the team. 
“You’re our companion now.”
“Haha! Great, I was hoping to join a team with plenty of warriors, since I’m new to all of this.”
He was full of bravado and bombast.
He also had zero dungeon exploration experience.
These two aspects were drawbacks, but…
He was a mage after all.
He wasn't demanding a higher share of the loot, and he said he'd follow orders in the dungeon. So, I figured I could control him. 
‘Cheap goods always come with a story behind them.’
Plus, having a mage in the team would definitely attract more high-profile applicants.
I mean, you don't see personality traits listed on the application forms, do you?
“I'll get in touch once we find the rest of the companions.”
“Alright, see you then.”
After Dwarki left, the dwarf who had been frozen throughout the entire conversation let out a long sigh.
“Isn’t that amazing? A mage, and a noble at that, yet so humble…”
I replied with sincerity.
“Hikuroad, you are the truly amazing one.”
100% pure sincerity.
***
The routine of my life in the city after that was simple.
Apart from visiting Raven's lab once a week, I would wake up at 7 am, eat a quick breakfast, and head straight for the library.
“Parsityev.”
“Good work.”
"..."
It was my second month, practically every day, and yet I had never had a proper conversation with this female librarian.
Grrr-
I would read books while taking regular breaks for meals every four hours until closing time.
But today, I had plans, so I skipped that.
I was about to leave a little before closing time when, unexpectedly, the librarian spoke to me.
“I have a question.”
“…What?”
“Why do you always wear your armor when you come to the library?”
Ah, that was it.
I answered honestly.
“I left it at the inn, and someone might steal it.”
“…I see. If that's the reason, then I understand.”
As soon as I finished answering, she closed her eyes as if the conversation was over.
“I thought you were completely indifferent to others, but I guess that's not entirely true, huh?”
It felt like I was losing, so I added, and the librarian showed a slight hint of displeasure on her face.
“I keep getting complaints from other users. They say they can’t concentrate on reading because of you.”
“…Really?”
“Yes. If you’re done with your business here, would you please leave and stop bothering us?”
Bothering?
It's not like I'm going to stay here after I leave.
I wanted to say something, but I didn't want to be a nuisance and get banned, so I left the library quickly and headed to my appointment.
It was just past 9 pm.
“I’m here! Bjorn! Why are you so late today?”
“Sorry, I couldn't find you. You're too small.”
“Hahaha! You're getting funny! Have a seat!”
I had started meeting the dwarf for drinks in the evenings.
About three times a week.
Of course, I don't meet up this often just to socialize. Every time we meet, we discuss the team.
“So, how was the one you met today?”
“He was a good, reliable guy.”
No, not that.
I wanted to know about his skills.
“Oh! He wasn't bad at all, contrary to my worries. He has a long history of being an adventurer, and I think he can hold his own in any situation.”
“I see.”
“…So, what do you think?”
I thought for a moment and nodded. The dwarf’s face lit up immediately.
“Phew, I was worried you’d say no again. We’re running out of time, aren’t we.”
His sigh spoke volumes about the burden he was carrying as the de facto team leader.
Well, he did do most of the hard work.
Let’s give him some praise.
It’s not like it costs anything.
“Good work, Hikuroad. You're a great team leader. I’m glad I chose you.”
“Haha! Really?”
“Of course. Where else can you find a team leader who respects his team’s opinion? Don’t lose sight of your initial purpose, and keep going like this. Unlike that idiot who kicked you out, you will become a great team leader.”
“Haha! You’re such a good friend, always praising me. This is my first time doing something like this, so I was worried. I’m glad I have you!”
My heart suddenly swelled.
This dwarf had once complained about my excessive interference, but now he had become such a great team leader?
“On that note, you’re paying for drinks today!”
“…Again? I bought last time!”
“I’m telling you, a great team leader can’t be stingy in this regard!”
“It’s not that I’m stingy…!”
Exactly one week left before the dungeon opened.
“Fine, I’ll pay this time! We finally have all our team members together. It’s not like some measly drinks matter!”
The team was finally complete.
***
Games and reality are different.
Just because the team was complete didn't mean we could just walk into the dungeon. There were other things to take care of.
First, we had to get to know each other.
We needed to decide how many floors we’d go down, where we’d be hunting, and of course, as adventurers, make sure the loot distribution was fair – this was a topic for debate.
If we didn’t have any problems after all that, we'd register as an official team with the guild. Lastly, we had to practice together every day and finalize our exploration plan.
‘Time flew by.’
It was the busiest week since I woke up in Bjorn Jandel’s body.
And finally, the day arrived.
[You have entered the first floor: Crystal Cave.]
A glimmering, colorful light gently enveloped the Crystal Cave on the first floor of the dungeon.
“Ah, here it is, the dungeon!”
Unlike the past when I was alone or with just one other person, I was surrounded by five people, including me.
My new team members for this journey.
Let me introduce them one by one…
“Lie-ate!”
“Ack! Damn it! My eyes!”
He blinded us with a blinding magic spell before we could adjust to the light. This blond weakling’s name was Reol Warb Dwarki.
Or Dwarki for short, you little bastard.
“This bastard’s gone—!”
As I was about to yell at him, the dwarf beat me to it.
“Dwarki, try to conserve your magic as much as possible.”
“Hmm, but it's so dark in here?”
“This is actually quite bright for a dungeon. If it’s too dark, just use a torch.”
“If you say so, alright.”
It was a change that happened over time.
The dwarf had realized that Dwarki wasn't a noble, so he started treating him more casually.
And for some reason, they had grown quite close.
The dwarf would act like he wasn’t paying attention, but he would always nag Dwarki and look after him whenever he did something foolish. It’s their quirk, I guess.
“Why did you bring so much stuff with you? You’re such a newbie. Hand it over, I'll put it in my bag.”
“Your thoughtful consideration, I shall not refuse.”
Just as the dwarf was, as usual, looking after Dwarki and helping him out, a high-pitched, cheerful voice rang out.
“Team leader, shouldn't we be moving?”
Misha Karlstain.
If you saw the pointed ears sticking out on top of her head, you'd know she was a beastman adventurer.
She was 25 years old, and this was her fifth year as an adventurer.
Just over five feet tall, thin and long, with a proud look that gave her a cold aura...
“Stop playing around and let’s go. I want to bash some monster heads already.”
She had this weird habit of mumbling at the end of her sentences.
She claimed it was because of her beastman physiology, but it was the worst slur I’d ever heard.
Oh, one more thing about her.
“Haha! I can’t disobey the princess’s orders!”
“Ugh! Don’t call me princess!”
“But you’re the daughter of the Crimson Cat tribe's chieftain. How can I disrespect you—?”
“I’ll kill you! Dwarf!”
Misha Karlstain was a princess of the Crimson Cat Tribe, one of the five great tribes.
Was it the thirteenth? The fifteenth? 
I don’t remember her order of birth.
Anyway, there’s no need to treat her specially or anything.
She’s only a princess in relation to human society. It’s not like she's actually a real princess.
There’s someone else we need to be careful around, actually.
“Murad, stop it. Even if it’s a joke, she clearly hates it.”
Brown Rotmiller.
Human, 34 years old.
He was a 7th-grade, but he had been an adventurer for a whopping eight years.
Even in the adventurer world, where strength is everything, he had the most experience out of all of us.
That’s probably why the dwarf always took a step back when he spoke.
“Ahem, I went a little overboard, didn’t I? I’ll be more careful from now on.”
“…Sorry.”
He’s personally my favorite team member.
He’s the only normal one on this team, in a way.
Of course, that means it’s harder to mess around with him compared to the others.
“Murad, we should start moving before the journey gets any longer.”
“Right, please do.”
“From now on, everyone, follow me.”
As we were about to leave, Dwarki spoke up.
“Wait, wouldn’t it be better if Bjorn or Hikuroad led the way? They're warriors, after all…”
“We’ll need help from them from the third floor onwards, but until then, I’m fine on my own.”
Honestly, I don't know what he’s worried about.
Rotmiller is a professional scout.
And he survived in the dungeon for eight years.
‘His adventurer grade is a little low for his experience, but…’
I actually appreciate that.
He must have experienced a lot of things in those eight years, and yet he’s still alive and kicking.
Not through brute force, but by using his other strengths.
‘He’s serious and inflexible because of that, I guess.’
Under Rotmiller’s lead, we kept moving forward, crushing the occasional monster that appeared, and finally reached our destination.
The outskirts of the first floor, commonly known as the Dark Zone.
We had taken the shortest route without getting lost, but the portal had already been opened by another group of adventurers.
“As expected, there were people ahead of us.”
“Don’t blame yourself. You did a good job.”
“Murad, that's no excuse for not trying harder. If you can't feel the frustration of your shortcomings, then your life as an adventurer is over.”
“Is, is that so?”
By the way, it took us about 10 hours to get here.
I didn’t say it in front of Rotmiller’s enthusiasm, but for a regular exploration team, this is quite a decent record. We’re not a running team that’s trying to get the portal opening experience, after all.
Honestly, I didn’t expect him to find the portal this easily.
‘He’s not a guide, but he’s this good at finding his way around…’
I’m starting to think there are other hidden talents he has that I haven’t seen yet.
On the other hand, this feeling of regret was creeping up on me.
‘If only Ainard or Erwen were here, we could have gotten the portal opening experience.’
The Dimensional Instability Phenomenon.
I privately call it ‘a bug,’ but it allowed me to gain portal opening experience.
But this method could only be used when I had a ‘promise’ or a ‘vow’ that allowed me to keep it a secret.
‘I’ll save that for later… when I find a truly trustworthy team. It’s not like I need the experience right now.’
I let out a deep breath, letting go of the remaining regrets.
The dwarf bellowed loudly.
“Alright, let’s go in!”
The dwarf was the first to step into the portal, and I followed right behind.
‘Please, let’s hope nothing bad happens this time…’
Maybe that’s wishful thinking?
[You have entered the second floor: The Beast's Den.]
The journey began in earnest.
