Chapter 41: The Magician and the Barbarian (1)
"No, please! Just once! Give me just one more chance!"
"What are you all doing? Why aren't you dragging those two out and throwing them in jail?"
First, the begging investigator and the unconscious explorer were removed from the scene. The compensation process was swift and decisive.  
Immediately after signing the agreement that they would not mention this incident, they were given a total of 6 million stones in cash, including a separate ‘compensation’ bonus. 
Of course, that wasn't the end of it.
“All the items in your name.”
“How does it look, Yandel? Take a good look."
The magician spoke with a strange look in his eyes, watching the barbarian rummage through the recovered backpack. 
“There might be something missing, right?”
“…Missing items?”
The barbarian flinched for a moment, then grinned as if he understood.
“Now that I look at it, something seems to be missing.”
“Oh my, is there something missing?”
“It’s not an item… about 1 million stones in cash are gone.”
It was a conversation in a theatrical tone that anyone could tell was a lie. 
The branch manager, listening silently, felt his vision go white from his sky-high blood pressure.
What kind of freaks were these!
“What are you talking about! There’s no way an explorer who just came out of a labyrinth would be carrying that kind of money—!”
“Are you saying we're lying?”
The branch manager flinched instinctively at the magician's cold voice.
“Th, th, that’s obviously—“
“Evidence?”
“There’s no such thing—“
“Oh my, you're accusing us of being scammers without any evidence?  Yandel, now that I think about it, it seems like this branch manager should be added to the punishment list too.”
"That’s true. Accusing a good barbarian and magician of lying, it’s clear that he didn’t receive a proper upbringing—”
“Stop it.”
The regional manager stepped forward, sighing.
“…We will also compensate you for the missing money.”
“It’s a compensation that should be given, so I won’t say anything about being grateful.”
It wasn't a sword, but what was the difference between this and robbery?
It was so audacious that it was absurd, but there was nothing the branch manager could do. He could only watch what was happening in front of him.
“Here are 1 million stones.”
“Wow, as rumored, the Explorer's Guild is truly loaded. Just say the word and they just pull it out of their pocket.”
“…I think we’ve shown more than enough respect for the Magic Tower until now. Don’t cross the line any further.”
“Sure, sure.”
“Then give me the Crystal Sphere now?”
“No. It’s better to give it to you after confirming that the punishment has been properly carried out.  Of course, I’ll promise that I won’t show it to anyone during that time.”
“…That promise must be kept.”
“Of course. Don’t worry. Anyway, we’re going now, so you guys can figure out how to deal with the crowd outside.”
With those words, the barbarian and the magician left. 
A heavy silence settled in the room, as if a storm had just passed.
“…….”
“…….”
As a result, the Guild had lost another 1 million stones, and they still couldn't get the Crystal Sphere back immediately. 
They also had the task of dealing with the crowd gathered in front of the Guild, as well as those involved in the incident.
The regional manager, who had been forced to smile in front of those two, was now as cold as permafrost.  Feeling a suffocating chill, the branch manager struggled to speak.
"I, I… regional manager…?  Thank you for… "
"Thank me?"
“Th, th… you didn’t go along with those two’s nonsense to protect me.”
“Well, you are my person, after all.”
"Sob! I will never forget today and I will work hard from now on—”
“Even if I need to fire you, I will do it myself.”
The branch manager, who had been determined to pledge his loyalty with a grateful face, looked dumbfounded.
“…Yes? Wh, what do you mean…?”
"Now that I look at it, you’re pretty naive. Did you think you'd be okay after making things like this?"
“Bu, but I really—”
"It’s done. I’ll take care of everything from now on. If you want to live, be careful even when you breathe until things calm down. Whether you take off your clothes or that guy dies suddenly, it needs to be an incident that’s completely unrelated to this."
Before the branch manager could say anything, the regional manager turned his back and stared at his daughter.
“Daughter, I’ll hear about why you came here today later.”
“…Yes, Father.”
"Let’s go then."
The office was instantly empty. The branch manager, left alone, thought.
“Ha, hahahaha……”
It must all be a dream.
***
A black spire that soared high into the sky. It was on the 31st floor of that building.
"How do you like it? What do you think of the Magic Tower?"
“The lack of windows makes it feel stuffy.”
“Uh… well, that’s true, but… without that condition, we wouldn't have been able to build a high-rise building like this in the city.”
This is where I am now: the personal research lab of Arrua Raven, a magician belonging to the ‘Altemeon’ school. 
"Come, sit here."
She brought me something to drink, clearing the pile of documents haphazardly placed on the chair. 
It was in a triangular flask.
“Ah, there’s no cup.”
I took a moment to examine the drink she offered me.  
And I came to a conclusion.
“…It’s water.”
“Yes, isn’t it? Do you want me to add some Basilisk extract?”
“No, this is enough.”
I didn't drink it, of course.  I know that the contents are really water, but I just don’t feel comfortable drinking it. 
Just a while ago, it probably contained those brightly colored liquids or monster organ samples, right?
I got to the point.
“So, why did you bring me here?”
“I have something important to tell you. You agreed to do me a favor later, right?”
Of course, that’s why.  I was in such a hurry at the time that I just agreed without thinking. But now that I’m here, I regret it. 
She’s not going to do something like perform a live experiment, right?
“As I said then, within the limits of what’s possible.”
“Good. That’s enough.”
“So what’s the favor you want?”
“I want to conduct exclusive research on the Essence you absorbed. It’ll definitely help you too. It’s unprecedented, so there’s a chance that something unique might be discovered, right?”
Her eyes changed as she spoke.  From the calculating look she had when she faced the regional manager to the scholarly look I saw in the Crack. 
It’s understandable, after all.
Apart from the mutated Crack I experienced this time, there was no Crack in all the floors with a vampire as a guardian.
“But what does exclusive research mean?”
“Oh, that? To put it simply, it means you’ll only provide samples to me.  I want to submit a paper in my name to the academic community.”
Are these magicians like graduate students in this world?
I don't understand the motivation, but….
It’s said that scholars have the most ambition when it comes to fame. 
Oh, wait a minute.
“Is it possible that you asked me to erase the vampire-related records because of this?”
When we signed the agreement at the Guild, she was the first to ask that the fact that I ate the vampire’s Essence shouldn’t be recorded.
Of course, I didn’t expect that it would completely keep it a secret….
It was better than doing nothing, so I also agreed. 
‘There’s a saying that 70% of your ability is hiding it.’
Honestly, I was grateful to see her taking care of these details personally….
She scratched her cheek awkwardly.
“Uh, well, it’s not like it’s not… “
A negation of a negation means it’s true. 
Raven immediately changed the subject.
"Ahem!  Anyway, I don’t want much. Just come once a week for about three hours and help me out.”
Three hours a week….
"What's the total duration?"
"Well, I think half a year would be enough…."
"Make it three months."
"Okay. So you’re agreeing to my request?"
"I will."
As the first issue was settled, Raven immediately brought up the next one.
"Then, coming back to that… should we finish the calculation?"
Calculation?
Is there still something like that left? 
I looked at her as if asking what nonsense this was, and she also adjusted the atmosphere. 
Just like when she had a standoff with the regional manager.
“You not only survived because of me, you also got a total of 6 million stones for free, right? It doesn’t seem unreasonable to claim my share.”
Ha, that’s it.
Now I understand how these magicians work. 
If I’m just an efficiency maniac, they’re ultimate profit maniacs.
So, I decided to adjust my mindset too.
“You want money? That’s a pretty interesting story.”
Like I’m about to smash a goblin’s head.
***
The argument continued.
In a more agitated voice than before.
“It would have been the same for any other magician.”
“I don't know. If it had been someone else, the regional manager would have immediately sold the Crystal Sphere as soon as he was offered.”
“But you already got your reward for that, right? From the regional manager, no less.  A whopping 1 million stones, too.”
It’s true that I made that much, so if I’m claiming a share, it should be me, by the oath of Behela.
“…Then at least give me the 1 million stones I got from the backpack. I got that entirely thanks to my advice.”
Did she say she wanted to be friends earlier?
I’ve decided to cancel that. 
Does she think I’m a sucker?
"I refuse."
"Alright. I’m not going to ask for everything since we’re going to do research together.  Give me half, 500,000 stones."
“I refuse.”
"Well, then 250,000 stones—”
“I refuse without even listening.”
I didn't compromise at all. 
After all, those who try to cause me harm are all bastards.
And I don’t negotiate with bastards.
I’ve gotten more than I deserve.
“This conversation is over.”
“What?  Do you know how much I lost in the Crack because of you?”
Then I made up my mind.
‘I need to crush her spirit before she underestimates me further.’
Honestly, I wasn’t entirely ungrateful for this incident. 
But that’s separate from this.  I need to show her what kind of guy I am in order to have a long-term, friendly relationship.
Because a guy who just smiles and laughs no matter what you do isn't a good guy, just a sucker.
‘The reason she was so persistent wasn’t really because she needed the money, but because she was trying to crush my spirit.’
“It’s done. Let’s move on to the next calculation.”
“The next calculation?”
She tilted her head as if she had no idea what I was talking about.
I spoke directly, like a barbarian.
“You have to give me 5 million stones.”
"5 million stones?  Why should I?"
“Well, you fed me the Corpse Golem’s Essence without my consent.”
“What, what?”
She exclaimed as if it couldn't be true.
"Oh, come on! I gave you a rare Essence that everyone wants, and now you're asking for money? Does that even make sense?”
It makes sense.
It’s not just stubbornness. 
I don’t know why everyone has such poor imaginations, but the story makes sense if you think about it carefully.
"Why do you think it doesn't make sense? You forced me to eat that Essence without my consent, to save yourself."
“I, I, I can’t believe I didn’t think of saving you?”
“Well, I don’t know about that, but I didn’t want it. So give me 10 million stones. I heard that's how much it takes to erase an Essence at the temple—”
“Why erase it when it’s so valuable! You crazy barbarian!”
“It wasn't the Essence I wanted.  You caused me serious damage.”
Unlike when we were playing price negotiation games, her face turned red. 
It sounds like stubbornness to anyone, but it also sounds reasonable depending on how you look at it.
For a while, she just kept breathing heavily, "Huu, huuk".  Then she regained her composure.
“…I heard that Explorers can’t find Essences even if they wanted them. So this is unreasonable. I should be the one getting paid!”
“That’s just your prejudice as a magician. Ask any other explorer. Ask them how they would feel if they ate an Essence they didn’t want because of someone else.”
“Ha! You’re saying that as if I don’t know any Explorers. Wait a minute. I’ll check right now.”
She was in a state of excitement as she pulled out the Crystal Sphere on her desk. She manipulated it as if she were dialing a phone number, and soon the connection was made.
“Ah, is this Partlan?”
[Who is this?]
“Hello. This is Arrua Raven of the Altemeon school. We met last time with your master, right?”
[Ah! Raven! I remember. But why are you calling out of the blue…?]
“I have a question for you. What would you think if someone fed Partlan an Essence without your consent, one that wasn’t planned?”
[Ha, ha, ha! I don’t know why you’re asking such a strange question, but to answer your question… I think I would be very angry.]
Her face lit up with confidence as soon as the connection was made. 
But after listening to the Explorer’s friendly answer, her face turned white as she began to watch me.
“Th, th, that’s right?  It’s hypothetical, but… what kind of compensation should be given?”
[If I were you, I would demand compensation in cash.]
“How much would that be…?”
[About 15 million stones would be appropriate.]
“Th, th, that much?”
[The cost of erasing an Essence becomes more expensive the more times you erase it. Those who worship gods are so greedy, tsk…….]
“Ah, ah, I see, I see…”
She seemed to lose strength in her hand, and the communication device fell from her hand, rolling away.
I picked it up for her, and put it back in her hand.
“There’s still one more question left, right?”
When I whispered in her ear, the blonde girl, with the appearance of a teenager, asked in a trembling voice.
“…Th, th, then, what would you do if you couldn’t pay the compensation in money, Partlan?”
[Well, I don’t know. If that happened and the person was right in front of me….]
The man on the other side of the communication device answered cheerfully.
[I think I would snap their neck and kill them.  Ha, ha, ha!]
