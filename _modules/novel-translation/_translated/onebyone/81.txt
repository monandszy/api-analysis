"Rotmiller, can you sense anyone inside?"
"The stench of sewage is so strong I can't tell."
"I see. Then I'll go down first, and follow me when you get the signal."
A 5-meter deep pit resembling a water tank.
With his shield on his back, he quickly descended the creaking ladder. As soon as he signaled, the rest of the party followed.
"It's eerie."
As the torch illuminated the area, a passage that couldn't be seen from above became visible.
"You lead from now on."
He quietly whispered, not wanting to make any noise, and put the man in front. Then he proceeded down the passage, holding the rope.
About a minute later?
"Damn..."
Mounds of corpses were visible.
Dozens of corpses in a state similar to mummies, like "Hansen" whose life had been sucked out.
No wonder the smell of decay was so strong.
"W-what... what is this...?"
Seeing his bewildered expression, it seemed like this wasn't the original state of this place...
"Be quiet and keep moving."
I pushed the man forward, who had stopped, and continued onward.
Even as I did so, I kept all my senses on high alert, ready to respond immediately in case something happened.
That's why I could react.
Click.
A sound as if a mechanical device was being activated, and a faint light began to leak out from between the mounds of corpses.
And a heavy voice echoed through the passage.
[Saveum, Vania, Hartia]
There was no need to see more.
One of the trap skills possessed by the priest of Karui.
Because of the unique sound effects, it was usually shortened to "Sababa."
[The character has entered the radius of [Call of the Evil God]].
Damn, he laid this down?
"Fall back!!"
While warning my companions, I pulled the man back with the rope.
Simple reason.
"Sababa" is not the kind of skill you can block with physical resistance or a Lythinium shield.
"W-huh?"
The man in my grasp, holding a shield instead of my hand, utters a confused sound.
And in that moment.
Hundreds of wraiths, like banshees, poured out from the other end of the passage.
"Agh!! Aaaaargh!!!"
The man screamed and struggled at the sight of them, but I didn't release my grip and hid myself behind him as much as possible.
Luckily, he was tall.
Otherwise, this wouldn't have been the extent of the damage.
[The character absorbed 102 wraiths.]
[Darkness resistance is above a certain level.]
[Effect reduced by 30%.]
[Character's maximum life force temporarily decreased by 29%.]
My vitality draining as if a hole had been torn in my body somewhere. My skin feels dry like someone who hasn't had water for days.
Misha was the first to detect my change.
"B-Björn are you alright!"
Misha immediately ran to me and checked my condition.
I stopped her from feeding me a potion and straightened my hunched body.
My muscles ached from being so tense.
'Damn, I almost died.'
[Call of the Evil God]
A trap skill that releases hundreds of souls in a designated direction upon activation. Its characteristic is that the maximum life force decreases by the number of times hit by souls.
Needless to say, if the maximum reaches 0, it's instant death.
Just like the man hanging in my hands.
"Is everyone alright?"
"Thanks to you blocking in front, we're fine. Anyway, that guy... is he dead?"
I didn't bother answering.
After all, it would be more surprising if he survived in that state, nothing but bones and skin.
As I let go of the man I was tightly gripping, the dwarf mumbled in amazement.
"...Not that I want to say this, but it's good we put that guy in front."
I agree.
And I'm not ashamed of that fact.
We are explorers without blood or tears.
"What are we going to do? If there's more of these, it's too dangerous to continue."
I thought for a moment and made a decision.
"Let's continue."
[Call of the Evil God] requires several ingredients to activate.
Most of them are human vitality.
There are many corpses around...
But even so, it wouldn't be enough for hundreds, so it was surely just a single activation.
'Besides, I have a feeling that if we don't deal with it now, there will be more trouble later...'
There's no basis for it, but I have that feeling.
Just as I was about to leave, the dwarf gave me something.
"Nothing special, but I found this while searching my belongings."
It was the identity card of the man who had turned into a mummy.
I don't know why a fugitive criminal would carry an identity card...
"I'll submit it to the administration when I get my extra pay... no, why are you looking like that?"
I froze, startled, after confirming the identity card.
[Hans Markom]
...He was a Hans too?
Ugh, I'm getting anxious all of a sudden.
***
After walking about twenty steps, we came to the hideout Hans E mentioned.
It was better furnished than I expected.
There was something like a bed, a table with leftover bread and coffee, and even a candlestick on the wall.
However...
"Ha ha, nobody's here?"
"Hmm, either he left this place entirely, or he's temporarily stepped out."
There's no sign of anyone at all.
There's nowhere to hide, really.
"Don't let your guard down. He might be hiding."
Still, we searched the area thoroughly, while keeping our surroundings in check.
Under the bed, under the table, and even checking if there were any hidden spaces in the wall.
We carefully observed for about 5 minutes, but there was no luck.
Until Dwarki used one magic.
[Riol Wurb Dwarki cast 8th tier auxiliary magic [Mana Detection]].
[Mana Detection]
A detection magic that reveals anything that has been infused with magical energy, in any way.
"How is it?"
"It's ambiguous."
"Ambiguous?"
"I sense some faint magic coming from the floor here... but it's too faint. I wonder if I'm just imagining it."
I then checked the floor where Dwarki pointed.
As I'm not a magician, I couldn't see anything unusual.
There's no subtle flaw or anything.
"Is there no way to find out more here with magical means?"
"No. But if I may make one guess, this magic seems to be concealing something below."
"I see."
After finishing a single question, I immediately lifted my mace upwards.
Seeing me like that, the dwarf asked.
"What are you doing, Björn?"
"I'm going to smash it down."
"...Smash it down?"
I didn't bother answering his question. After all, magic had been blocked, so it was time for physical means.
Like a true Barbarian.
Kwang-!
The moment the mace, which was twice as heavy and powerful as before, struck the floor, the ground shook.
But that was all.
"Björn, you can't open magical devices that way."
Dwarki, who had been watching, gave a lecture as expected, but I continued to swing my mace.
Kwang! Kwang! Kwang! Kwang!
It's made of solid steel, so even though I'm smashing the ground, the mace is fine.
Of course, the ground was just slightly dented, but nothing more.
Therefore—
"Stop it. Dwarki said it too. You can't... "
I take off my breastplate, take off my shoes, take off my helmet, and take off the backpack I was carrying.
Everyone is looking at me with the look of 'Why is he suddenly doing this?'
[The character cast [Gigantification]].
[The character's body size increases, and physical stats increase proportionally to size.]
My body grows twice as large, and with it, my strength surges. The dwarf still lets out a tired voice.
"No matter how strong you are, magic can't be... "
It can't be that way?
As a veteran player of this game and a current Barbarian warrior, it's still difficult to agree.
If you can't break it with strength—
Kwaaaang-!!!!
It's because you don't have enough strength.
"...???"
Oh, of course, excluding ghosts.
***
"It worked."
"Dwarki, what happened? You were adamant that it wouldn't work."
"W-well... I don't know either. Why it worked... "
Ignoring their murmurs, I checked the floor.
After hitting it twice, a crack appeared with light shining through, and by the third hit, the hole shattered. Underneath was a staircase, surprisingly.
"A hidden staircase in this sewer... "
It was so deep that even when I put the torch below, I couldn't see the end.
It felt like a passage to an underground world.
"Do we really have to go down here...?"
Misha looks at me with a wary expression.
Honestly, I didn't feel like it either.
It was being used as a hideout, so I thought there might be a space to hide a body at most...
'But what is this?'
On the one hand, I felt like I was getting caught up in something troublesome, but on the other hand, I was a little curious. After all, sewers were off-limits in the game itself.
Of course, I wouldn't risk my life out of curiosity.
However...
"Björn, I can faintly smell that woman down there."
"What?"
"She definitely passed through here. And not long ago."
Damn, what do I do?
Should I just stop here, turn around, and tell them to figure it out on their own?
I'm deeply troubled.
So I asked Rotmiller for his opinion too.
"Rotmiller, what do you think? Do you think it's best to retreat as we are?"
"...I think it's okay to just check it out a bit. I don't smell anyone else down there but that woman."
It was a slightly unexpected answer.
Did I show my feelings?
Rotmiller chuckled and added an explanation.
"I have a feeling it won't be too dangerous."
Well, it was because of his Intuition stat.
There's no clear basis, but I didn't dismiss his words.
'His intuition is surprisingly accurate.'
In fact, he accurately sensed that Hans E was hiding.
Was he reluctant to go to the hideout?
If he had sensed that it was dangerous due to traps, it makes sense that he was the only one to oppose the majority vote.
'Intuition... it might be a better stat than I thought.'
I then made a decision.
"Rotmiller, you lead from now on. If you feel anything even slightly off, we're turning back immediately."
Rotmiller's senses are quite reliable.
***
"Deputy Commander, the 'Gate' has been destroyed."
A man frowned at the report from his subordinate.
The underground shelter built thousands of years ago, back when Raphdonia was just a mere lord's castle, before it was endlessly expanded to become the city it is today.
And the city 'Noirark' built there.
Most of the entrances leading to this place are guarded by members who constantly stand guard.
But...
"The Gate is destroyed? Could it be an attack by the royal family?"
"I think that's unlikely."
"...Tell me more."
At the man's urging, the subordinate quickly explained the situation.
"Upon closer inspection, it's a Gate that has been forgotten since the Karui incident. According to the last scouting report, a vagrant was using it as a hideout."
"Hmm."
The man stroked his chin.
It was his old habit that came out when he was thinking.
"There's no reason for the royal family to bother us now... but it's still an intruder, so we need to confirm."
"Yes. Which unit should we contact?"
"Do we really need to send a unit?"
The man asked back, looking at the woman beside him.
She was the woman he had been talking to before the subordinate's report.
Did they say that the Barbarian I saved before became a famous explorer in the city?  I was just getting interested, but the story was interrupted...
"Amelia, you can quietly handle this, no matter who the opponent is. Go there in our stead."
I can finish the rest of the story later.
