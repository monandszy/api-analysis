Episode 8 Night Companion (1)
I am walking through the cave.
This time, I'm not waddling, I'm walking properly.
"The character has equipped leather boots."
"Total item level increased by +5."
The boots are a little big. Thanks to this, I learned something else. The old man had big feet compared to his height.  Anyway, they were pretty sturdy, so even if I step on a trap, I won't be fatally wounded like before.
"The character has equipped a two-handed hammer."
"Total item level increased by +30."
This hammer, made of solid iron, is about 1 meter long.  When the old man used it, it was a two-handed club, but I can swing it with one hand.
"The character has equipped shoulder pads."
"Total item level increased by +13."
They are made of steel. I loosened the straps a bit, and they fit perfectly.  I took off my shirt and just wore the pads, giving me a gladiator-like appearance.
"The character has equipped a backpack."
"Inventory increased."
Now I don't have to carry the bloody gemstones like bread, and it's much less cumbersome to move around.
Chew, chew.
I pull out jerky and chew on it.
It's just a snack, so there's not much, but it's better than bread.
I carefully stored the remaining portion, using my pocket knife to cut it so that it doesn't get saliva on it.
Day 2, I graduated from primitive life.
If I'm thirsty, I drink the water I stored in my canteen.
If I'm unsure about the direction, I use my compass. If I want to know the time, I take out my pocket watch and look at it.
A single emergency potion will protect me from any injuries.
Isn't that a bit ironic?
I killed someone, and now I can live a little more like a human.

Smash was a good skill when used as a shield, but now that I have a proper weapon, its power is different.
Pow-!
One swing of the hammer and the goblin disappears in a flash of light.
If I had known this, I should have just chosen a weapon at the start. After all, I could have bought a shield later with the money I earned.
Well, I didn't know I'd be fighting this well then.
Is it because I'm in the Barbarian's body?
When I fight, it feels like my body isn't mine. I should be getting used to it by now, but whenever I see this body exceeding my expectations, I still find myself exclaiming in surprise.
"I'm so sleepy I could die."
I yawn and pick up the two gemstones that have fallen nearby, putting them in my bag.
It's a change that came with the start of day 2.
The goblins are now starting to come out in groups of two.
Tomorrow, they will probably be in groups of four, and this will continue until day 7, when the maze closes. That's how it was in the game.
In that sense, it's not bad yet.
I gained new weapons, so my combat power increased, and thanks to various consumables, I'm a little safer.
It's going smoothly.
'Except for the fact that I keep getting sleepy.'
I have been moving continuously and fighting goblins since yesterday. But I haven't slept for even 10 minutes, and even then, I was just standing up.
I want to sleep.
I'm not even hoping for a blanket or a pillow.  Even a bare floor is good, I just want to squat down and lie down.
I'm really going to die if I don't—
"Ah, damn it!"
I almost tripped over a stone while I was dozing off.
Luckily, I was lucky, unlike me. If it had been a trap, I would have been in big trouble.
"I might as well just take a short nap…."
As soon as I made the decision, I leaned against the wall with the shield and hammer in my hands.
Even though I don't have any night companions by my side…
It actually feels safer this way.  If I'm going to be ambushed anyway, goblins are better.
In that case, getting stabbed with a carving knife is more likely to survive, right?
Than being hit with a hammer while sleeping.
Tap-
Damn it.
I open my eyes as I hear the familiar footsteps I've come to know so well.
They didn't even show their faces for over 4 hours when I was on watch.  They immediately show up because I'm sleeping alone.
Now I know why the old man told me not to let my guard down.
…Those tenacious bastards.
I immediately run out and stab the goblin in the head with my hammer.
Thwack-!
"Grrr, grrrk!"
There were two of them sneaking up, but one of them immediately turned and ran away as soon as its friend was turned into mush.
Yeah, go away.
I don't even have the energy to follow you.
"Damn bastards…."
I check the time. It's not even 10 minutes.
In the end, I have no choice but to continue to wander the cave and hunt goblins.
If I get tired and can't take it anymore, I lean against the wall and take a short nap, like I did before.
I've had a few close calls while I was dozing off, but there were only two times I felt like I was going to die.
The first time, I opened my eyes to a feel a presence, and a certain explorer was sneaking up on me.
He met my gaze, laughed awkwardly, and quickly backed away.
…It still gives me chills when I think about it.
The second one was pretty close, but…
It's currently happening.
"The character was attacked by a goblin during sleep."
For the first time, I woke up to pain instead of a feeling of presence.
I saw a goblin in front of me. I immediately hit it with my hammer and killed the one in front of me, while the other one, as usual, ran away.
"Grrr, grrrk!!"
I immediately checked the source of the pain.
But, holy crap, there's a carving knife stuck between my collarbones.
…Damn it, no wonder my left arm wouldn't move properly.
Whew, at least it just ended with pain.
If I had been a little shorter, or if the goblin had jumped a little higher, this carving knife would have been in my neck.
Clack.
I clench my teeth and pull out the carving knife.
Then I take out the potion from my bag and drop a few drops on the wound. As soon as I close the lid and put it back in my bag, the blood starts bubbling and regenerates quickly.
Chi-chi-chi-chi-chi-chi.
Is the guy who made the potion a psychopath?
It hurts more than when I got stabbed.
"Grrr, h-h-h-h…."
The pain disappears after about 5 minutes.
This kind of pain would be enough to wake me up, but my eyelids are even heavier than before.
My focus blurs as soon as I lose concentration for a second.
It's time to make the decision I've been putting off.
Even though the Barbarian's body is sensitive to killing intent, I can't keep dozing off like this.  Didn't I just wake up after being stabbed?
'I need to rest.'
I check the time. It's been about 14 hours since I split up with the old man.
The adventurers who are active on the first floor are probably starting to go back and look for their night companions.
"Hey Barbarian, are you looking for a night companion?"
In fact, as I wander around, the explorers start talking to me first.
And they're very enthusiastic.
"Hmm, you look pretty tired. Come on, let's go."
"If you're a Barbarian, you can be trusted. We'll be 3 if you come with us, what do you say?"
It feels like I've become a popular prostitute.
Is it because everyone's in the same situation on day 2?
I don't see anyone complaining about the smell. Or maybe the smell wasn't the problem from the beginning.
After all, I was in a pretty bad state yesterday, covered in blood and missing one shoe, so I was waddling.
"Really? What a shame."
Despite the numerous love calls, I rejected them all and continued down the hallway.
Damn, is there no good Barbarian around?
Actually, the best case for me is to find a member of my own race and make them my night companion. The problem is that I haven't seen a single Barbarian since entering the first floor.
"You're looking for a member of your own race? Hmm, that's going to be tough."
"Tough? Why?"
"Even a Barbarian who's just finished his coming-of-age ceremony will go to the upper floors within a couple of months.  I'm sure there aren't even a hundred of them on the first floor."
I did some research, and it seems that Barbarians are rare on the first floor. It's strange, though, for someone with this kind of body to be hanging around on the first floor.
To begin with, 99% of the explorers I met on the first floor were humans.
"Why don't you come with us?"
"Sorry, I can't."
"That's too bad. May the blessing of Lafdonia be with you on your journey."
"Thank you."
This guy seemed pretty trustworthy, but I kept moving after that conversation.
Once I found out that Barbarian hearts were expensive, I couldn't find a single explorer who didn't seem suspicious.
Click.
I pull out my compass.
Ever since I got this, I've been moving south, but I haven't even left the goblin zone yet.
I'm realizing just how big the first floor is.
'…Should I just give up on finding a member of my own race?'
I didn't think about it for long.
I decided to give up on searching for a needle in a haystack and make a realistic plan.
I'm going to find a night companion, even if it's not a member of my own race.
But no humans.
I'm going to find one of the other races that make up less than 1% of the population.
An elf who values promises, or a dwarf with a personality as bold as a Barbarian would be the best choice… but…
It doesn't matter if it's a different race.
Most of the other races, unlike humans, have a little more time to spare.
They have the potential to go straight up, given the time, but they won't kill their fellow adventurers for a little bit of money.
Having decided that, I wandered the cave for about an hour.
And…
"You have encountered a wounded, unfamiliar elf."
I finally found the race I had been searching for.
***
As soon as our eyes met, a strange, suffocating stillness descends.
"…"
The elf with pointy ears leans against the wall and stares at me without saying a word.
Was she sleeping alone without a night companion?
Her amber eyes, which shine like a cat's, reflect a sense of bewilderment and deep suspicion.
She clearly just wants me to pass by and disappear… but…
Shhh.
As the standoff drags on, the elf nervously gets up from her seat.
But she's awkward.
I take a closer look and see a wound on her abdomen.
"You're hurt."
It's not deep, but a long, torn laceration.
It's not a wound that could have been caused by a goblin's carving knife.
I quickly reach a conclusion.
"Is it a human?"
The elf didn't answer.
She's scared of me.
I understand. If I were in her situation, I would be scared as hell if a huge guy like me approached me while I was injured.
She's even a girl, too.
She's small, too. Maybe 160 cm tall?
Anyway, it's not a bad situation—
"Save me."
Huh?
"Please. Just spare me, Barbarian, I have a younger sibling to take care of in the city."
While I was thinking, "What kind of development is this?", the elf, without hesitation, plopped down on her knees.
Her eyes were already teary.
"I beg you."
What? Why is she so meek?
To be honest, I thought she was a cool, independent type.
She looks the part, and in the game, elves were usually that way.
Damn, I would have approached her differently if I had known she was this type.
Before things get worse, let's clear up the misunderstanding.
"I'm not going to kill you."
I look her in the eye and pronounce my words carefully.
The eyes are the window to the soul, so if I just give her time to calm down, she'll know that what I'm saying is true—
"Do you really have to be like this, Barbarian?"
—Well, I was wrong.
I'm experiencing an identity crisis.
It feels like I'm a Barbarian harassing a high school girl in front of the school.  I'm definitely a Barbarian.
"Just once, please, just once, let it slide."
As I remain silent, the elf looks even more scared, backing away and tucking her collar.
I was speechless.
What kind of life do Barbarians live? What's their image like that she's acting like this?
"Ugh…."
I can't help but sigh.
What should I do?
Maybe if I show her that I'm not that kind of guy, she'll get over her misunderstanding?
…It's not a bad idea.
"Get treated first. We'll talk later."
I step back and pull out herbs and bandages from my bag and throw them at her.
"This is… Licho leaf…?"
So, this really was Licho leaf, huh?
I can finally use it without worry.
I was afraid it might be poisonous, so I couldn't use it even though I was injured.
