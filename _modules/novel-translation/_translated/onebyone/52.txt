Chapter 52: The Half-Baked Team (2)
WHOOSH!
Even from a distance of 10 meters, the heat radiated intensely. A pungent, smoky smell tickled my nose.
THUMP!
My brain registered the situation, and my heart constricted.
"If that had fallen on our heads..." 
We'd all be dead, no doubt.
"Everyone, prepare for combat!"
Just as the dwarf yelled out, startled by the sudden situation, the explorers emerged from the bushes.
A total of five individuals. Four of them formed a protective formation around one mage.
"Damn, just looking at them, they don't seem like level 3 adventurers..."
Why were these guys here? 
I silently prayed they weren't raiders.  
The beastman with triangular ears smirked at our battle-ready posture. In a domineering tone, he said, 
"This is the Orc territory of the Dzarwi Clan. Leave immediately."
"Clan?"
No wonder they all wore the same crest on their chests. 
"Damn..."
A curse escaped my lips. It wasn't that I didn't understand what they were doing.
"Claiming hunting grounds at level 3?"
Damn, isn't that a content that's only available at level 5 at the earliest?
***
"[Dungeon & Stone]" is a single-player game. But, surprisingly, it has a control content. It first appears to prevent cross-map movement before clearing the main episode. But later, after establishing a clan, players can also control hunting grounds.
Of course, this requires a huge workforce, making it a loss unless it's for rare monsters or boss spawns.
"But controlling it at level 3?" 
My head simply can't wrap around it. 
I mean, would you control level 7 monsters and gain benefits from them?
Take that mage, for example. Using such a high-ranking individual to kill orcs is a waste.
"...The Dzarwi, I believe they operate at level 6 and above. Why are you here, in a place like the Orc territory?"
The dwarf, seemingly hearing this for the first time, asked cautiously, his voice laced with uncertainty.
But the reply was cold.
"There's no need to explain anything to you."
Oh, alright then. I understood. But the dwarf did not. 
Though he had shown himself to be a bit foolish in our time as teammates, he was an explorer after all. He was sensitive to matters related to his own benefit. Even more so if the cause was external, not internal.
"I've heard that some clans may be granted rights within the maze by the royal family in recognition of their achievements. But I've never heard of this place being the Dzarwi Clan's territory. Moreover, there's no proof that you are even one of them."
The dwarf was logical, given the nature of the situation. They were obviously higher level adventurers, based on their equipment and the magic I'd just witnessed. But there was no proof they were members of the clan.
However…
"I think running away is the best option..."
Frankly, I found the possibility of them being imposters scarier. Large clans at least cared about how outsiders perceived them. But phony bastards wouldn't have that consideration.
"Interesting story."
The beastman glared at us, his expression tinged with displeasure. 
But the dwarf wouldn't back down. 
"I hear that a lot."
As the silent standoff stretched out, the tension escalated.
THUD.
I felt something approaching from behind. It was Misha. 
Why was she suddenly sticking so close behind me?  As if hiding from something... 
"Are you, perchance, Half-Baked?" 
The beastman's brow furrowed as he asked.  I felt Misha flinch behind me.
What? Was she really hiding?
"O, O-brother..."
Misha stammered, slowly stepping out beside me. The beastman's face twisted further.
"I told you not to call me that outside."
"S, sorry."
"Tsk, typical Half-Baked, even your speech patterns are awful." 
Misha remained silent, her head bowed at the beastman's barb. As I expected, they weren't close enough for him to be calling her "Half-Baked."
"What's their relationship anyway? Are they, by chance, related?"
Just as that thought crossed my mind, the mage who had been observing from behind, finally spoke up.
"Just curious, is that lady your sister?"
"Yes, in a way."
The beastman nodded politely, and the mage stroked his shiny goatee. 
"Hmm, I owe Kalstein a favor. And since she's your sister, we can't call her a stranger. So, we'll make an exception for them—"
"There's no need." 
"Huh? But..."
The beastman firmly rejected the mage's offer once more.
"Father wouldn't mind. It's an internal family matter so I cannot elaborate further."
His voice was cold, laced with stubbornness.
"If you say so. Alright then."
The mage changed his mind, nodding without further argument. But did he think an explanation was necessary?
"Listen, you two."
He took a step forward, his tone now soothing, almost like he was trying to reason with us.
"There's been an urgent need for the Orc Warlord's Essence due to some clan matters. If everything goes well, you can hunt here from next cycle. So, please go elsewhere for now. Or, maybe to the outskirts where the Warlord doesn't appear."
Being a former mage, he spoke more gently than the beastman. But, ultimately, it was still the same message: "Get lost." 
"I refuse."
The dwarf shook his head. With an unexpected sharpness, he taunted them.
"It seems you're claiming rights without any royal authorization. Why should we cater to your clan matters? Besides, don't you know your actions are illegal?"
"...Illegal?"
Was it a particularly jarring word for them?
"A wise explorer knows when to be cautious with their words. But you, apparently, don't."
The mage's gentle eyes hardened. But perhaps he wanted to avoid any future complications?
"What makes you think we're breaking any law? We're simply being considerate, because if we're here, you won't have any monsters left to hunt.  It would be best if you left."
He used roundabout wording. But the meaning was clear: if we didn't leave, he'd sabotage our hunt with every fiber of his being.
The dwarf, sensing this, clenched his jaw, his face filled with resentment.
"Damn it..."
We couldn't be forcibly evicted or harmed. Those actions were clearly defined as illegal in the maze law. This meant we had no legal recourse.
"Actually, relying on the law in the first place was our mistake."
I felt sorry for the dwarf, who had been trying to protect our team's rights, but I wanted to withdraw from the beginning. 
Isn't the maze a place where the strongest make the rules? 
I was afraid that if we stubbornly refused, we'd disappear without a trace. 
"By now, he should have realized his pride is misplaced. We should quietly persuade him to back down."
I was watching the situation unfold, deciding on our next course of action. 
"You two have nothing to worry about. I'll handle this." 
Dwarki suddenly chimed in, speaking in a way that made no sense.
"Handle it? What's he talking about?"
I didn't have a clue what he was getting at. But before I could question his intentions, Dwarki walked towards the mage, a smile on his face.
"Hahaha! Long time no see, Senior."
"...Senior? Did we ever meet before?"
"Not really, but as someone dedicated to the art of magic—"
"Enough, who are you?"
This fierce reaction was unexpected, wasn't it? Dwarki hesitated for a moment, then forced a laugh.
"Hahaha, my name is Reol Warb Dwarki, an 8th-grade mage authorized by the Royal Family of Raphdonia—"
"Turns out you're trash after all."
"...What?"
The mage's face twisted in disgust. No, I think he was even more annoyed than when the word "illegal" was used. And this time, the mage didn't seem to have any intention of hiding his emotions.
"The art of magic? Dedicated your life?  You've just learned a few basic spells, yet you strut around calling yourself a mage, earning a living by peddling your pathetic skills in the market!  You've got the audacity to say such things? I'm disgusted by your shameless audacity. Please, don't say such things anywhere."
He spewed harsh criticism, like a machine gun.
"Is he a mage? His wordplay is incredible."
I was marveling at the mage's relentless barrage, but I was worried about Dwarki.  If I'd been told such things to my face, my mental fortitude would have crumbled as well...
"...K, khuck!" 
Oh, he did crumble. I glanced at him, and saw Dwarki blinking, unable to breathe properly. His mouth opened and closed repeatedly, like a fish thrown onto the sand.
Watching my friend's mental breakdown, the dwarf finally snapped.
"Hey, that's going too far!"
"I was simply stating the facts."
"What? Stating the facts?"
The dwarf's neck veins bulged. His eyes were ablaze with murderous intent. And the moment we perceived that... 
"Looks like you're asking for it—!"
He grabbed the dwarf by the scruff of the neck and lifted him up.  He then snatched the battle hammer from his grip.
But, as expected…
ZZZZZT!
A tingling sensation spread through my fingertips. 
"Hikurod Murad used [Electric Shock]."
Damn, has this guy lost his mind?
I muttered, trying my best to suppress my rage.
"Get a grip, Hikurod."
We were all almost dead.
***
"Good friend you've got there. You'll be eternally grateful to that barbarian. He saved all of you."
"..."
Did the dwarf finally regain his senses?  
He ignored the mage's taunt and swiftly led the team away. Once we reached the outer area, he bowed briefly.
"My apologies. I lost my temper. As that guy said, if Bjorn hadn't been there..."
We'd all be dead, no doubt.  Not many people would willingly let those who attacked them go unscathed.
"Just now, you acted rashly, almost leading the entire team to ruin."
Rotmiller rebuked him firmly.
"...I have no excuse." 
He seemed to recognize his mistake, and he didn't try to defend himself. 
Honestly, I wished Rotmiller had been harsher.  But...
"But since no harm was done, I won't say anything further."
Rotmiller was too kind to play the role of a drill sergeant. 
"Though you were rash, I personally believe that standing up for your team when they were being disrespected was a good thing."
I couldn't understand. This situation called for a verbal lashing, if not worse. And yet, he was praising him?
"At least he should have his share deducted and this exploration should be free service, no?"
There should be a punishment and a reward for wrongdoing. It's the only way to prevent people from repeating the same mistake. So, in my heart, I was hoping for a more practical solution. But the atmosphere wasn't right to bring it up.
"Damn, am I the weird one?"
Rotmiller's magnanimous act of forgiving the dwarf created an odd atmosphere. It was a feeling I had hated since childhood, hard to put into words.
"...I'm sorry, too. It could have gone smoother if it wasn't for me." 
Misha was the first to be swept up in the mood.
"N, no way! It couldn't have gone any better!"
Dwarki was the second. 
At Misha's self-reproach, he panicked and waved his hands frantically.  He stuttered but spoke resolutely.
"I, I, I... Of course, I'm not always right... But! I believe that because you were there, we at least got to hear their side of the story before getting kicked out! So, never think that way!" 
It wasn't a particularly eloquent consolation, but the emotions behind it were genuine and conveyed to everyone. 
Perhaps that's why...
"Do you know why I hate talking about my family?" 
Misha suddenly started talking about herself.
"I'm treated like I don't exist in my family. Maybe some of you already have an idea."
Misha glanced around, checking our reactions. Rotmiller averted his gaze, one of those who had an idea. I pretended not to notice. 
Fairies control spirits. Dwarves with the blessing of the innocent are more efficient when handling numbered items, and barbarians have soul imprints. 
Like this, beastmen also have a unique racial characteristic, besides their exceptionally high base agility stat.
"I couldn't make a contract with a "Spirit Beast" in my family."
Spirit Beast.
That's what beastmen called those ancient creatures they made contracts with. And the form of the contract varies.
They can summon them to fight alongside them, or they can perform a spiritual possession to increase their physical abilities. Or, they can receive blessings, allowing them to use the beast's special abilities.
Of course, not every beastman can do this. Only a few talented individuals are chosen by Spirit Beasts.
But the issue here is…
"It means she's from the sub-clan leader's lineage, right?"
The Kalstein family, the lineage of the sub-clan leader.  In other words, she's a pure-blood.  The fact that she can't handle a "Spirit Beast" is a big problem. It's not just about her talent or lack thereof. It's evidence that casts suspicion on her bloodline itself.
"When I was younger, I got along well with my siblings. But things changed when I became an adult and still couldn't make a contract with a Spirit Beast.  Everyone called me Half-Baked. Said my blood was only half-breed..."
An illegitimate child.  Her mother passed away early, so no one knew the truth. Misha couldn't bear the constant scrutiny and left home.  She devoted herself entirely to martial arts, slowly growing as an explorer.
"It's tough to hear what you're going through, but I'm glad you shared it."
When her story ended, the dwarf, uncharacteristically serious, patted her head.  Misha didn't act prickly like she usually did. More like a domesticated cat, maybe?
"Hikurod... He truly thinks of us as his teammates and was sincere in his anger."
What? How does that work?  I find this emotional roller coaster impossible to follow. 
"Hahaha! Since you said it, I'll share my story too.  I wanted to become a blacksmith. But I had no talent, so I couldn't even get rid of the apprentice tag for 10 years. I was over 30 when I became an explorer.  That's why I ran away.  But I had to earn money, so I took the plunge when I got the chance."
The dwarf, seemingly touched by Misha's confession, spoke calmly about his past.  And then it was Dwarki's turn. 
"I'm the most talentless person you'll ever meet. Though I had the means to learn magic thanks to my family's wealth, I lacked the talent to enter the Mage Tower. If I had been a proper mage, I'm sure he would have treated me with some respect."
He then explained his goal:  to earn money through exploring and learn more magic.
It seemed like the story would end there, but...
"This is the first time I've encountered a situation like this."
Rotmiller, who had been silent, chuckled, reigniting the dying embers.
"I need to apologize too. When Murad and Kalstein mentioned their annual leave, I couldn't help but feel angry."
"R, really?  Did that happen?"
"Yes. It was my ugly jealousy. I didn't even know their situations, but I thought they were born into different races and complaining about being slow or fast, while they were lucky."
Human explorers have their own advantages.  They can use aura, become spirit summoners, mages, or priests.  Some are even born with giant bodies like barbarians.  
They essentially have the best of all races. But it's just a possibility, a story for the few who possess special talents. 
"Hahaha! So, it seems our team is full of Half-Baked folks! But it's a good thing, it means we don't have to feel inferior to each other anymore."
The dwarf forced a laugh, lightening the mood.  And to that...
"You're right about that."
Dwarki, the talentless mage, was delighted.
"I'll do my best to contribute to the team!"
The beastman, born pure-blood but unable to handle Spirit Beasts, was touched.
"I don't want to jinx it, but I hope this team sticks together for a long time."
Even Rotmiller, the mundane 8-year veteran human explorer, felt the same way.  They all acknowledged their shortcomings, spoke openly, and comforted each other. 
As a result, everyone's attention naturally turned to me, the only one who hadn't confessed yet. 
"..."
"..."
Their eyes seemed to ask, "What about you?"
"Uh, I don't have any of that..."
I felt like I had to say something to avoid becoming an outcast.  But, in my panic, my words tumbled out without a filter.
"I, I, I don't have a mother!"
