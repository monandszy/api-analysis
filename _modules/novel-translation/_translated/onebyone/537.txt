Part(text=## Episode 537 Rainbow (4)

One of the 8th-floor cracks, the City of Light, Kalhue.

And within it, appearing from the final boss room, the Crack Guardian.

Milayel, the Heavenly Spearman.

Why this thing was roaming the general field was beyond me.

But first, to summarize this monster:

Its most significant trait was using Numbered Items despite being a monster.

And...

‘There's a 3% drop rate for Lush Growth.’

It dropped other Numbered Items too, but ‘Lush Growth,’ classified as a Single Numbered Item, had the highest drop rate.

That's why I remember grinding endlessly for it when I was raising my Lancer. Lush Growth was practically considered the ultimate weapon for the Lancer class.

Separately, its Essence was also incredibly good.

‘Anyway, putting aside why it appeared here…’

As I said before, if we could catch this thing, the reward was guaranteed to be substantial.

Getting the Essence would be a jackpot, and even getting the weapon would be a jackpot.

However, the problem was our current condition.

‘We can’t catch it.’

I quickly reached a decision.

The monster itself wasn't impossible to defeat with our current strength.

However, the situation was simply too unfavorable.

‘First of all, the Priest is out of the picture now, unable to perform any more miracles…’

Even the main dealer, Erwin, was on his last legs.

And that wasn't all.

Fortunately, there were no casualties yet, but everyone was considerably exhausted…

[Growl! Grr! Growl!]

[Groooaaar—!]

Monsters still swarmed around us.

Realistically, we were at a point where survival took precedence over rewards.

“Jandel, what are we going to do?”

Amelia asked me in a grave voice.

There was no need for further deliberation.

“We charge towards the coast.”

“The coast…? Ah, you mean we run away—.”

“I said, we charge towards the coast.”

“……”

We had no other choice.

However…

‘We need to do what we have to before we flee.’

If we were going to run, we needed to set things straight first.

There was no way we could just leave behind a 2nd-grade Essence, right?

‘Putting it in the test tube is out of the question.’

As tempting as it was, it was simply too risky.

It would take quite a while to transfer the Essence into the test tube.

The chances of something going wrong during that time were far too high.

In other words, it meant we had to feed it to someone and then run…

‘Who should I feed it to?’

The decision was difficult, but I needed to make it quickly.

And so…

Kwaaaaaang—!

I roared as I deflected the spear thrust by the charging Milayel with my shield.

“Müll Armin!”

Müll Armin, leader of the Armin Exploration Team.

A peculiar explorer who, while being the leader of a clan, also held the curse-specialized Necromancer class.

Honestly, it stung a little to give such a precious item to this guy, who was practically a stranger…

“Take the Face-Bird Essence.”

No matter how I looked at it, he was the best fit.

It seemed like he had also recently leveled up, opening a slot for an Essence.

“……Pardon?”

“Didn't you hear me? Hurry up! We don't have time!”

“Ah, yes…!”

Startled, he finally snapped out of his daze and rushed forward, Amelia covering him as he made his way safely to the Essence.

“Are you… sure about this? I'm not even a member of Your Lordship's party…”

Oh, for crying out loud.

I was already swamped just dealing with this spear-wielding lunatic.

“Doesn't matter, just hurry!”

“Y-Yes, sir!”

As I shouted with urgency, Müll Armin stretched out his hand and absorbed the Essence.

Okay, we’ve taken what we needed…

After confirming with a sidelong glance that the Essence absorption was complete, I pushed Milayel back with all my might, creating some distance.

Then, I quickly issued new instructions to the team.

“What are you waiting for? Get into formation!”

“……”

“We’re charging towards the coast with everything we've got!”

“P-Pardon…?”

Why were they having so much trouble understanding me?

“Run!”

“Ah, yes…! Everyone, form up! We’re retreating with all our might!”

Ugh, talk about ruining the Barbarian Baron's dignity.

***

"Huff… huff…”

We sprinted, our breaths hot and ragged.

This time, I wasn't at the forefront, but at the very rear of the main force.

Because, when you’re running away from something, the back was always the most dangerous.

[You cannot escape, mortal.]

The monster, which always spouted lines before battles in the game, actually spoke human language in reality.

The problem was that it kept repeating the same phrase like a broken record.

‘Ugh, how many times have I heard that line already?’

Several times, I tried engaging in conversation while fleeing, but in the end, I couldn’t get a proper response. Honestly, I was starting to question whether it possessed intelligence at all.

‘The monsters in the Village Head’s village definitely felt sentient…’

It occurred to me once more that the Village Head's village was an anomaly.

Most monsters were like this, after all.

The Vampire Duke Kambormier in the Bloodstained Citadel.

The Knight of the End I met at the White Temple… they all spoke human language, but communication was impossible—.

「Milayel, the Heavenly Spearman, has cast [Recursion].」

And of course, just as I was lost in thought.

Wheeeeeeeeek—!

A menacing whistling sound pierced through the air behind me. I immediately turned and raised my shield to protect my upper body.

KwaaAAAAaaaaang—!

Ugh, that damned spear.

Every time I blocked it, I could practically feel my shield falling apart.

A Single Numbered weapon with skills applied to it was a recipe for disaster.

‘Well, at least it only used one skill…’

Incidentally, this was a phenomenon caused by Milayel possessing the 'Guardian' trait.

Crack Guardians had fixed patterns.

Whether their HP dropped to a certain point or a device within their vicinity was activated… unless they passed certain thresholds, their actions remained predictable, confined within a set framework.

‘If it were a regular ‘Tyrant,’ we wouldn’t even have the luxury of escaping like this.’

Of course, it didn't mean that it was an easy opponent.

Even the skill it used in the first phase was not to be taken lightly.

「Milayel, the Heavenly Spearman, has cast [Recursion].」

[Recursion].

A very simple throwing skill with unavoidable judgment and increased damage.

However, it came with one very troublesome characteristic.

「Milayel, the Heavenly Spearman, has retrieved Lush Growth.」

No matter how far the distance, once thrown, the weapon would return to the caster’s hand after a certain period.

And…

「The power of [Recursion] increases slightly until the battle ends.」

It was a type of stacking skill, so to speak.

The more the pattern repeated, the stronger the skill became.

And thanks to that…

KwaaAAAAaaaaaang—!

The shield, which had even endured the Village Head's sword, now had holes riddled through it.

Ha, repairs were going to be a nightmare in this place.

As I sighed at the sight of my battered shield, I quickly checked the situation ahead.

Even though I was bringing up the rear, thanks to [Gigantification], I could oversee everything from above, making it easy to check on the front.

‘We’re doing surprisingly well.’

I didn't expect the formation to crumble or face major difficulties in clearing a path just because I was no longer at the front.

In fact, I had anticipated this.

Still, why did I feel a sense of dejection?

‘Whatever… Let me focus on my own role.’

Whether someone acknowledged it or not, silently fulfilling one's duty was the way of a warrior.

I don't know how much time had passed since I fell back from the main force, single-handedly marking Milayel and taking on the brunt of its spear attacks. 

"The sea!"

A cliff came into view through the lush trees. And as we descended below it, the familiar coastline we had first encountered on this island unfolded before us—.

「Milayel, the Heavenly Spearman, has cast [Recursion].」

Ugh, this thing never tires.

As soon as the spear, having pierced my shield, turned into light and disappeared, it came hurtling back towards me.

Thud—!

But for some reason, this time, pain erupted from my shoulder.

I was sure I blocked it with my shield…

"Ah."

The spear simply passed through one of the many holes riddled through my shield.

“B-Bjorn!”

“Jandel! Are you alright?!”

Misha and Amelia, who were at the front, rushed towards me, their faces etched with concern.

Bersil, in place of the Priest who had exhausted his divine power, hurriedly took out a potion.

However, I refused their concern.

“Later. Launching the ship is our priority.”

“Ah…”

We still had some time before the spear returned, so I hurriedly pushed through the crowd and ran towards the coast.

“Uh…”

“Oh…”

“Is he… going to be alright?”

The explorers, busy clearing a path, made way for me, their faces a mixture of shock and awe at the sight of me.

Well, it was understandable to be surprised by a giant Barbarian with a spear the size of a small tree lodged in his shoulder.

Splash—!

I quickly summoned the ship. Still in my [Gigantification] state, I personally lifted the explorers and placed them on the deck.

Once everyone was on board, I returned to my original size, boarded the ship, and poured magic stones into the magic-powered propulsion device, ready to depart.

As the ship swiftly moved away from the island and I was finally able to breathe a sigh of relief…

「Milayel, the Heavenly Spearman, has cast [Recursion].」

The spear came flying once again, piercing my abdomen.

“H-Hey, Jandel…!”

“My Lord!!”

Oh, for crying out loud…

Clutching my painful stomach and bending over, I looked up and glared at the creature standing on the coast.

Alright, now I had a good look at its face…

“Until next time.”

A Barbarian never forgets his enemies.

***

Swooooooosh—!

The ship cut through the silver waves.

The deck was cramped with so many people on board, but no one complained.

Being able to sit and rest was a blessing in itself.

Everyone was content with the current situation, relaxing and recuperating. Well, except for the few explorers whose faces were shrouded in darkness.

“One casualty…”

During our escape from the island, one of the warriors from the Hex Exploration Team perished.

Sigh… it was always the warriors who died in situations like this.

As a fellow warrior, I couldn’t help but feel a pang of sadness every time I heard news like this.

“It might sound strange coming from me… but it's a miracle. We only lost one person.”

“Yes, I suppose you’re right. What was the deceased's name?”

“Shelianne Emertown.”

Her face instantly came to mind.

We hadn’t spoken much outside of work, but she was a rare female warrior in this line of work, so she stood out.

She always had a hearty smile on her face.

“What about the body?”

“We were able to recover it.”

“That’s a relief…”

After that exchange, I gathered the explorers and suggested we hold a funeral for the fallen explorer.

Although everyone was exhausted and weary, no one objected.

Whoosh—!

Of course, a funeral held within a labyrinth, especially on a ship, had to be brief. We laid down a fire-resistant cloth, cremated the body, and placed the remains in an urn.

Thud—! Crack—! Crack—!

Even during the funeral, monsters periodically fell from the sky. They were blocked by the barrier we had erected on the deck, falling harmlessly into the sea.

Drip.

Like a window on a rainy day, the bloodstains on the barrier coalesced into droplets and slid down.

“Rest in peace.”

“Haha, don't be too resentful. We might be joining you soon enough.”

“Shush, don't jinx it.”

As explorers who lived so close to death, lighthearted jokes were exchanged even in the solemn atmosphere.

But no one reprimanded them for it.

Everyone knew.

Everyone had their own way of coping.

"It's over. Rest. And thank you all for your hard work."

After the funeral, everyone was free to rest again.

While the wizards couldn’t completely relax, having to maintain the barrier, it was still much better than maintaining it on that island.

As soon as we got on the ship, we had removed the magic-powered propulsion device and modified it, connecting it to the magic circuit.

‘We have enough magic stones, and the monsters aren’t falling as frequently as expected.  If nothing major happens, we should be able to hold out until the rainy season is over…’

Could we finally breathe a sigh of relief?

Lost in thought, I leaned against the wall and rummaged through my subspace, retrieving a spare shield.

Of course, it was a 3rd-grade shield, significantly inferior to the one I had been using. Back then, I didn't have much spare money, and even when I prepared this, I wondered if I would ever actually use it.

‘But that day has actually come.’

As I chuckled wryly, someone approached me.

“Baron.”

It was Müll, the leader of the Armin Exploration Team.

“What is it? You should be resting.”

“I apologize for interrupting your rest. But… there’s something I’d like to ask you.”

“Go ahead.”

Even after receiving my permission, Müll hesitated for a while before speaking.

“Why…?”

“Why what?”

“The… Face-Bird Essence. Why did you give it to me?”

Ah, so that's what he was curious about.

To be honest, the answer was quite simple.

First of all, Einar, Amelia, Erwin, and Misha were not even considered.

They all had specific Essences that were suitable for them.

Bersil couldn't consume Essence because he was a wizard.

‘The only other possible candidate was Aouyen…’

Even for Aouyen, it wasn’t the most ideal Essence.

He could use [Mimicry] to imitate monster skills and contribute to battle depending on the situation, but that was about it.

It would practically render the Face-Bird Essence's core passive useless.

That's why, ultimately, I chose Müll.

“Because you were the one who could utilize that Essence the most effectively.”

“Is that… all?”

To be perfectly honest, no, it wasn’t.

The Armin Exploration Team owned shares in the exploration, didn't they?

Part of my reasoning was that by giving him a 2nd-grade Essence now, he wouldn't be able to raise any objections when we claimed our share later.

However…

‘There’s no need for me to stoop to that level.’

So I simply shrugged.

“Yes, that's all.”

“But! We are ultimately outsider—.”

“How can you be outsiders? We're already comrades.”

“C-Comrades…?”

“Yes, is there something wrong with that?”

At my nonchalant response, Müll Armin remained speechless, and an awkward silence stretched between us.

“You…”

Müll, who seemed about to say something in a choked voice, shook his head.

“It’s nothing. I’ll be going now. Please, get some rest.”

Although I couldn’t pinpoint exactly why, he seemed to have made a significant decision.

***

Six days had passed since the beginning of the rainy season.

The voyage after escaping the island had been peaceful.

We still had to deal with monsters endlessly crawling onto the deck and a constant barrage of creatures falling from the sky, but…

Compared to the chaotic scramble we had experienced while escaping the island, it was nothing.

Anyway, thanks to this period of tranquility, I had ample time to organize my thoughts and review my plans…

‘Alright, I’ve made up my mind.’

As I took out a pendant I had carefully stored within my subspace, Misha, who was beside me, lit up.

“Oh, Bjorn? Is that…?”

“…….”

“Are you… are you giving it to me…?”

Honestly, this girl.

Eyes on the prize, I tell ya.

Sensing her covetous gaze, I quickly returned the pendant to my subspace.

No.7777 Garpas’s Necklace.

It was time to put it to use.
