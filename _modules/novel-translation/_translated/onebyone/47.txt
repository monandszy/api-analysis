Chapter 47: Companions (1)
Pure magic stone exchange for 230,000.
Equipment cost for the blonde-haired 4-person party: 800,000.
Settlement received from the Guild: 5,000,000. Added extortion: 1,000,000.
On top of that, 30,000 in compensation from the innkeeper.
"Though a Golden Mask is worth about 500,000 stones... I decided to keep it so I'll pass on that."
Subtracting 300,000 stones allocated to Ainarr and 150,000 stones "thrown away" yesterday from this sum gives my current assets.
"6,610,000 stones..."
Essentially, with the current living standards, enough money to last 3 years without entering the Labyrinth. 
Of course, this calculation is possible because of the relatively low taxes in the early stages, but whatever.
"Taking out a generous 70,000 stones for monthly expenses... my actual total budget is around 6,540,000 stones."
I quickened my pace, recalling the items on the shopping list I had prepared the previous night.
Well, it doesn't mean I actually walked to my destination.
"Are you taking the 10-person carriage going to the 2nd district?"
"Yes."
Arriving at the shared platform, I paid the 500 stone fare and boarded the 10-person carriage.
The regular fare per person is 250 stones, but...
The Barbarian's large size makes it impossible for another person to ride with him.
"Damn it."
I felt strangely resentful.
All the more so because it's an unarguable reason.
"We've arrived."
Sitting in the seat, I was asleep, drooling, when I arrived at the northern hemisphere of the commercial district, Kommelby, 2nd district.
It took about 4 hours.
If I could have crossed through the 1st district, the Royal Capital, Karon, it would have been halved, but...
"My current reputation score wouldn't allow that."
First, I quickly ate at a nearby restaurant, then headed towards my destination following the city map I had purchased.
Finding it was easier than I thought.
I didn't even walk for long before I saw a magnificent building in the distance.
[Alminous Central Exchange]
One of the facilities I used most when playing the game.
The Central Exchange.
It has the advantage of not having to physically walk around the city and making it easy to find specific items.
Of course, it comes with a usage fee.
"Are you here to register for consignment sales?"
"No, I'm here to search for items."
I drew a numbered ticket and waited for a while, then submitted the documents I had prepared to the Exchange employee.
"There are a total of 12 items that meet the criteria. Would you like to check the information?"
"Of course."
For reference, the search usage fee is 3,000 stones per item.
After paying and waiting for a while, the employee brought me some documents.
"Please check the contents and tell the employee over there the item you want, and they will guide you to where the actual item is."
In the game, I could just press the purchase button, but in reality, it's done this way. With this system, the usage fee makes sense.
Because there's a labor cost.
"Anyway, let's check it out first."
Like the other users packed in the area, I sat in an empty seat and checked the documents.
Because there were only 12 items that met the conditions, it didn't take long to read them all.
"I want to see this item."
I chose the item with the most reasonable price on the list and went to the storage room with the employee's help.
After confirming several times for any defects, I purchased it without hesitation with cash.
[Expandable Backpack]
Storage Capacity: 8th Grade
Form: Standard Medium Backpack
Magic Enhancement: Automatic Organization, Individual Withdrawals, Lightweight (Low)
Selling Price: 2,500,000 Stones
Expandable Backpack.
It's slightly different from the so-called subspace, but for my current financial situation, this is much appreciated.
As long as the storage capacity is 8th grade, it's three times the size of the extra-large backpack I've been using, and...
"It has all three magic enhancements."
They are all worth the price if you think about it.
"Automatic Organization" can be omitted, but "Lightweight" is almost essential.
Think about it. No matter how big the space is, it's meaningless if the weight stays the same.
"In that sense, Individual Withdrawals is the same."
It's an expandable backpack I bought for convenience.
But without the "Individual Withdrawals" function, you have to take things out in the order they were put in.
"It was such a pain in the game, but it'll be a real pain in the ass in reality."
Well, I'm a little disappointed that it's a backpack form, but...
It's greedy to ask for more than that.
I decided to be satisfied with that and went back to where I was with the purchased backpack on my back.
And then I searched for other items.
I now have about 4,000,000 stones left.
"The character has equipped an Expandable Backpack."
"Inventory is significantly increased."
With this, I've taken care of the convenience, so it's time to increase my actual combat power. 
***
4,000,000 stones.
Enough to get a full set of plate armor made of steel and still have some left over, enough to raise the Undead Insignia to level 3 in one go.
Either choice is good, but...
I didn't choose either.
Well, because the situation has changed.
(P) Source of Darkness - When the heart is intact, it resists death.
I ate the Vampire Essence, which I wasn't expecting.
Thanks to that, I'm now a body that won't die as long as my heart is intact.
In other words, strengthening the Undead Insignia or getting parts like greaves is just not efficient enough for the price.
After careful consideration, I made my final decision.
"Let's just upgrade the tier of the equipment."
The so-called higher tier.
In other words, instead of steel, the 1st stage metal, I decided to buy equipment made of 2nd stage metal.
"The character has equipped a Lythinum Breastplate."
"Combined Item Level increases by +270."
Lythinum.
One of the 2nd stage metals that is twice as light and strong as ordinary steel.
Its features are that the metal is white and ridiculously expensive.
"1,910,000 stones for just the breastplate..."
The form of the breastplate I purchased through the exchange was the same as the steel half-armor I sold for scrap, but the price was more than five times higher.
"Well, it's obvious, since you need 2nd stage materials to explore the 4th floor."
Among all the equipment parts, the reason I chose the breastplate first was simple.
Because protecting the heart safely maximizes the benefits of the passive skill [Source of Darkness].
In any case, safety is paramount, so there's no room for disagreement here.
However, the second piece of equipment made me think until the moment I decided to buy it.
"The character has equipped a Lythinum Large Combat Shield."
"Combined Item Level increases by +315."
Should I change my weapon or buy a new shield, the one I sold for scrap?
After much deliberation, I purchased the shield for 2,100,000 stones.
There are many reasons, but the main one is...
"I don't need to deal damage anymore."
Until now, I've only entered the Labyrinth in a 2-person team, a duo.
But to go higher from here, you need to play in a team of at least 4 people.
In other words, it's more efficient to become a human wall, holding a shield and protecting my comrades.
"The Vampire Essence isn't the essence of a damage dealer either."
More than anything else, unlike weapons, the shield is equipment I can use even after obtaining "that essence", and...
I'm now empty without a shield.
Well, my wallet is now completely empty, but.
"Well, the equipment is starting to shine now."
Somehow, when I look in the mirror, my heart feels content.
Is this also a change that came with being a Barbarian?

After finishing my rational spending, it was already evening.
I ate again at the restaurant where I had lunch and took the carriage back to the 13th district where my lodgings were.
And then the day was over.
"With this kind of travel time... "
Later, when I make a lot of money, I should move to the central district.
There are too many inconveniences when you live in the outskirts.
I moved a little bit inwards this time, but it's still a long way to the Dimensional Plaza.
"Ultimately, is everything a problem of money..."
I resolved to make money, having spent a lot today, and went to sleep.
The next morning.
"I've finished what I had to do right now, so should I go there again?"
As a diligent Barbarian, I got up early in the morning and headed to the library.
It's a gamer's habit in Korea to grind when they have free time. Well, this isn't a game, it's reality, so it's grinding I can do.
I still lack the knowledge and common sense of this place.
"In that sense, it'd be nice if the library was close when I find a house."
Books are nourishment for the soul.
The fact that I could spend money rationally at the Exchange was because I read books at the library, wasn't it?
"What was the title of the book?"
I don't remember the title well, but it was a book that listed the average transaction prices of Exchange items over 10 years.
There were so many numbers that it was a pain to read, but it was the best textbook for learning the prices.
I continued walking, thinking about this and that, when I soon arrived at my destination.
Nothing had changed from when I last came.
The smell of books vibrating through the entire building, the countless glasses-wearing skinny guys who arrived earlier than me, and this librarian sitting at the counter with a sleepy face.
"Long time no see."
I greeted him like I did the last time, and the librarian looked at me and gave me a strange look.
Then he mumbled quietly.
"...How?"
Ah, did he see that?
"Heehee, Lythinum armor and shield. I paid 4,000,000 stones for them. Oh, and this on my back is called an Expandable Backpack –"
"Parsityev."
Well, he still doesn't get jokes.
I went into the library, leaving behind the chronically fatigued librarian who had just cast a magic spell and was nodding off again.
But is it because I have good equipment on?
I feel people's eyes on me from all over, more than usual.
Most of them are filled with awe.
I'm not sure, but if I think otherwise, I'll be embarrassed, so let's just think that way.
"...Was it a bit too much to come to the library with my equipment?"
Maybe it was.
But think about it, what's the harm?
I'm a Barbarian.
I decided to just ignore it and do what I had to do, pulling out a pile of books with keywords in mind.
[The Founding and Development of the Adventurers' Guild]
[Casebook of Plunderer Judgments III]
[Legal Terminology Dictionary Comprehension Log]
[The Birth of Mozlan]
[……]
[……]
Is it because I almost got framed and died last time?
Anyway, I'm more interested in things like the Adventurers' Guild, the Royal Family's direct institutions, and the law.
There's a famous saying in the gaming world, isn't there?
If you don't know, you get beaten.
So, I have no choice but to learn somehow.
Grrr-!!!
I went out every 4 hours or so to get a meal and read books, and it was evening again.
I decided to read the books I hadn't finished tomorrow and returned to my lodgings.
Unlike usual, there was a letter waiting for me.
The sender was the Adventurers' Guild.
The contents said that Hikurod Murad wanted to meet me.
"I guess I can't go to the library tomorrow."
After cleaning the shield and breastplate with a dry cloth for about an hour, I lay down on the bed and went to sleep.
***
I woke up early, but I had time to spare, so I slept in for a change.
It was a little past noon.
I washed up quickly and headed to the agreed-upon place.
Clink-!
An inn that also serves as a restaurant and bar.
As I entered the first-floor hall, I saw many people eating and chatting amiably.
I looked around for a while before finally finding the person I was looking for. Those dwarves are so small that I can never see them!
I hope they just stand up and eat from now on.
It's the same thing anyway.
"Long time no see, Hikurod."
"Ha! It's really you! It was marked as level 7, so I was wondering... "
The dwarf who greeted me with a smile was startled when he saw me.
"No, what kind of equipment is that?"
Ah, you saw it too.
I answered as if it was nothing special.
"Oh, this? You can tell by this white glow that it's Lythinum armor and shield. And this on my back is called an Expandable Backpack. It's nothing special, I just bought it this time."
Really, it's nothing special.
