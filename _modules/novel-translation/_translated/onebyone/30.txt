Chapter 30: The Bloodstained Citadel (1)
Any gamer, upon encountering a suspicious wall or peculiar sculpture, will instinctively press the interact key. 
I was no different.
This habit had helped me discover countless "hidden pieces," or hidden elements, in the 9 years I've been playing "Dungeon & Stone." 
Take this fountain sculpture, for example.
“Bjorn?”
“Ah, I'm coming.”
I swallowed my unease and followed the others into the inner castle. I decided not to mention the sculpture.
A barbarian knowing something even a lifelong scholar of magic couldn't?
‘Best to avoid attracting suspicion.’
The lie about seeing it in a book wouldn't work this time, especially since ‘that thing’ is an item that can't be taken outside even with distortion magic.
“This is the inner castle.”
If the outer castle acted as the first line of defense in medieval times, the inner castle was the last bastion. This is where the lord's vassals, knights, and soldiers would be stationed, along with various military facilities like armories.
Raven sighed as she looked around.
“…I've heard about this, but there's nothing left here at all.”
The inner castle, a third the size of the outer castle, was utterly destroyed. The structures were completely demolished, leaving only ruins. There were no monsters here either.
“Let's move on to the next place without delay.”
Under Raven's direction, we spent about 30 minutes clearing away the rubble and found a passage leading to the underground.
“Murad, would you take the lead?”
“Of course!”
“Oh, conserve your magic, and light the torch too.”
The dwarf pulled out a torch and stuck it on his head. He's so short, he looks like a mole miner from a comic book.
Whoosh!
We pushed open the thick wooden planks and slowly descended the stairs hidden beneath.
The third chapter of the Bloodstained Citadel: the underground prison.
I swallowed nervously and recomposed myself.
「You have entered the first floor of the underground prison.」
Ugh, I'm not good with creepy things…
***
“Raven, what kind of monsters are in here?”
“Skull Rats, Banshees, Deathspins, Chimera Wolves, Ghoul Lords, and Corpse Golems, I believe.”
“Except for the Corpse Golem, I've dealt with all of them.”
“You would have. The Corpse Golem is a monster that only appears in the Bloodstained Citadel.”
“Hahaha, it's been a while since I got to rack up some achievements!”
The dwarf was ecstatic at the prospect of gaining experience by fighting new monsters. But I couldn't feel the same way.
The illustrations were creepy enough, but how gruesome would they be in reality?
“Anything else we should be careful of?”
“Just watch out for the Flesh Explosion. It’s not that powerful, but its bodily fluids are mixed with acid poison, so if you get hit up close, it can be fatal. Of course, I’ll be blocking for you before that happens.”
“Hahaha! We have the mage with us, so we have nothing to fear!”
“It's all thanks to having such reliable warriors like Murad.”
What a lie. 
Just yesterday, they were glaring at each other, arguing over loot.
Thump.
As we descended the last steps, the maze-like underground prison unfolded before us. In their cages, Deadmen were chained and snarling. On the floor, skeletal rats scurried around, making strange noises.
“Bjorn, are these monsters too?”
“Those are the Skull Rats I mentioned.”
“I didn’t ask you, mage!”
For your information, they're the same as the Deadmen: no rating. They don't really have the combat strength to be called monsters, so we just trampled them as we saw them and moved on.
And soon, we encountered the Banshees.
“Khhh, khhhk!”
The Banshees were in a ghostly state, their faces only vaguely visible. They were flitting around erratically.
“Bi, Bjorn… ”
Ah, he's afraid of Banshees.
Seeing Einar clinging to me, Raven chuckled. It's a good thing Einar can't see this. Otherwise, he'd be screaming again.
“Be careful not to bump into the Banshees. They’re not too dangerous for a few, but…”
“…but?”
“You’ll have a really, really terrible experience.”
“Ah, a really, really terrible experience? What does that mean! Explain yourself, mage!”
“Well, why don't we leave it to your imagination?”
Seeing Einar's bloodless face, Raven smirked.
It seems she’s not very nice either, the way she’s getting revenge like this.
I sighed inwardly and chimed in.
“I heard there’s a way for mages to deal with Banshees.”
“Hmm, I heard you were fond of books, and it seems your insights are indeed broad.”
Are my insights really that broad? Maybe if you add the caveat “for a barbarian.” 
But still, this is pretty basic.
“Well, let's stop joking around and take care of these Banshees first. Teirun Shell.”
A shaft of light shot forth from Raven's staff, piercing a Banshee. The spell’s in-game name is Magic Force. It's basically the mage’s basic attack, so there’s no casting time.
“Keeeee-!”
After a while, dozens of Banshees began to swarm, emitting intense hatred. They had detected the ‘mark’ left behind by their fallen comrades.
For a mage with powerful area-of-effect skills, this would actually be something to welcome, but…
“Iherno Haindar.”
Firestorm. Flames erupted from the magic staff, filling the one-way passage.
And when the flames died down, there were no Banshees left.
Whoosh!
Once again, the magic stones scattered on the floor rose into the air and flew into my bag by themselves. 
Honestly, that's what I envy the most. Not having to pick up the magic stones one by one.
Phew, how long would it take to bring a mage into the team… 
It makes me realize I still have a long way to go.
***
The 2D world beyond the monitor is different from reality. Especially if it’s a creepy feeling that you can feel in your skin.
「Your character has entered the second floor of the underground prison.」
The underground prison I experienced firsthand felt more like a mad scientist's laboratory.
Chimera Wolves, with mutated, bulging muscles and three heads each.
Ghoul Lords, leading hordes of thirty Elder Ghouls each.
These 8th-rank monsters all had grotesque appearances, and even the small objects around them, one by one, evoked images of horror games.
But the climax is yet to come.
“Raven, you're amazing. Aren't you scared?”
“Well, I’ve always loved anatomy. This is nothing to me.”
Damn, it’s not barbarian anatomy, is it?
Come to think of it, the high price of barbarian hearts is because they're magic ingredients…
“Ah, we’re here.”
Having hunted all the monsters in the underground prison, we arrived on the third floor, where we found a hidden door connecting to the underground chamber of the collapsed lord's castle.
Normally, we would have had to get a map from the guard room first…
“There's a door hidden behind the wall? It's good that we memorized the map beforehand.”
Thanks to Raven's meticulous preparation, we didn't have to wander around. 
Well, I would have found it myself. The underground prison had the exact same structure as in the game.
‘But that's only possible because I'm a player.’
It makes me realize how much mages are respected.
Powerful attack magic.
Utility-focused support abilities like the Curse of Aggravated Wounds.
Their vast knowledge gained from diligently reading countless books.
It’s not for nothing that mages receive better treatment in the team than even priests.
“It’s best to leave your bags here in front of the door. Especially for Yandell.”
I felt a bit ashamed as I placed my oversized bag, which went from my head to my thighs, in front of the door. 
… I’ll buy a magical bag as soon as I make some money. This thing has been a nuisance ever since we started.
“Oh, Yandell, you’ll need to light your torch too from now on.”
Following Raven's instructions, I fixed my torch to the top of my head.
That completes all the preparations.
Creak, creak, creak-
We turned the round valve to open the iron gate, and a putrid stench hit us.
“This is unexpected.”
“Ma, mage… do we really have to go in here?”
“I hate it too, but we have no choice.”
This space reminded me of a sewage treatment plant. The cylindrical walls were lined with large pipes, dripping a thick, black sludge.
Also.
The floor was piled high with broken limbs and heads, and the gas from their decay filled my nostrils, causing a headache.
“Ugh, whew!”
The first one to vomit was the porter. He had been clinging to Raven’s side like a bodyguard, simply to maintain appearances, but he literally puked his guts out with a completely expressionless face.
The second one was Raven.
“Ugh, whew!”
She may have built up a visual tolerance from her numerous dissections, but she’s apparently weak against smells.
Surprisingly, I could handle it. I would have certainly fainted if I had seen this in the past, but my barbarian body, with its tough stomach, wasn’t affected in the slightest.
“It’s a good thing you’re still okay. Let's go on.”
I felt an indescribable sensation as I slowly approached the center.
Squish. 
With each step, I heard a sound like stepping on a sponge.
As the light drew nearer to the center, the massive figure, previously only visible as a silhouette in the darkness, became clearer.
“Hel, lo.”
Amazingly, it spoke to us. In a female voice, like a broken tape with a voice guide.
“Kuk, kek! Li, kekekek, save me! Me! Kiki, ka-d-d-d, deli, cious, fa, ther, kihi!”
Uh, well, uh…
To be honest, I was quite shocked.
“Huu… ”
Damn, you were silent in the game.
Why are you doing this to me?
The words tumbled out of my mouth, but what good is complaining?
I looked over, and even the supposedly reliable dwarf was frozen in fear.
“Snap out of it, everyone!!”
I immediately yelled, snapping my teammates out of their stupor.
But was it a reaction to my yell?
“Father! Father! It hurts! It hurts! It hurts! It hurts! It hurts!”
The pile of corpses huddled together rose to its feet and took a step forward with something that may have been feet.
Wooong-!
The intermediate boss of the Bloodstained Citadel.
The Corpse Golem.
***
The game "Dungeon & Stone," a masterpiece of the obscure, isn't completely unknown, though. At least, its illustrations were famous. 
The vibrant illustrations, as if taken with a black and white camera, were widely used online as what we call "memes." 
Few people know that the illustrations came from the game itself.
I had a sudden realization.
“Damn.”
No matter how realistic the drawings were, they couldn't compare to the real thing.
“It hurts! It hurts! It hurts! It hurts!”
If you took thousands of human arms, legs, and heads and packed them tightly together, would it feel like this?
Each one was moving independently, as if they had their own will. The hundreds of mouths were the same. 
They were all spouting random, uncontrolled feelings, like “I’m in pain,” “I’m cold,” “I’m resentful,” “Kill me,” “Save me.” 
“Kyaaaaaaaaaaaa—!”
Or maybe it was just screaming. 
The bizarre harmony created by the mixture of all sorts of grotesque voices sent shivers down everyone’s spines.
“Hicuroad! Watch out!”
The mage, who supposedly excelled in anatomy.
The 3-year dwarf veteran, who had faced countless monsters.
The human male who gave off an air of being more than just a porter.
They treated the two newbie barbarians like mere extras…
But amazingly, only I and Einar were the only ones who remained calm in this moment.
“What are you all doing?!”
Just as Einar was watching the Corpse Golem, he grabbed the dwarf by the back of the neck and pulled him up.
Kaboom!
The pile of corpses flew like a pair of throwing axes, exploding where it landed. Blood and flesh splattered everywhere, sticking to Einar and the dwarf.
Sizzle!
Einar was fine because it hit his clothes, but the dwarf was different.
“Agh! My eyes! My eyes!”
Damn, it seems the debris got in through the narrow gap in his helmet and hit his eyes.
The dwarf was instantly disabled.
And the mage who said to trust him…
“Ugh, whew!”
He’s still throwing up.
…What are you guys doing?
No wonder things were going so smoothly.
Of course not.
“Einar! Take the dwarf and go back to protect the mage!”
With that, I raised my shield and faced the Corpse Golem.
I had no choice.
I wanted to escape as much as possible, but…
Those guys were supposed to be the bus drivers, but they were acting like fools.
“Behel—laaaah!”
If I’m going to survive, I’ll have to take the wheel myself.
