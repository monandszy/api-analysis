Chapter 64: The Cabin (3)
Ever since I became stranded in the witch's forest, I couldn't help but wonder.  Was the dwarf band scouring the woods to find us?  Could we possibly be reunited by chance?
To put it plainly, it was a futile fantasy.
"As if," I muttered to myself.
Fantasy and reality always diverge.
Knowing there were only three of them, I had held onto a sliver of hope.  Now, a wry smile tugged at my lips.  Miracles were simply not meant for me.  Tragedy, perhaps, but not miracles.
"...Bjorn."
Misha climbed onto my back, her voice a whisper in my ear.  "What do we do now?"
Well, I was contemplating that very question.  I never imagined running into these bastards here.
"Their names...  Davis something, wasn't it?"
I first ensured my mace was ready to crush skulls at a moment's notice.  Then, I scrutinized the sleeping man before me.  Davis.  A true devotee, his neck and wrists adorned with amulets, his shirt studded with the symbols of the Reathlaas faith.  In simpler terms, the leader of the explorer group who, following Elissa's schemes, had attacked us.
"Why the hell is he here?"
The more I looked at this guy, the more questions arose.  Why was he resting here?  Elissa had gotten rid of the others, leaving only these three.  And why was he looking as ragged as us?
"..."
Putting aside my inquiries, I returned to the window to check the interior.  Thankfully, the other two were still sound asleep.  Having identified the religious fanatic, I could now deduce the identities of his companions based on their builds and hair colors.
"That must be the archer and the swordsman from back then," I murmured.
The hulking shield warrior and the red-haired archer were nowhere to be seen.
"...Could they have also been separated from the group?"
The thought occurred to me, but I wasn't certain.  Oh, what to do?  This was making me uneasy.  Should I just forget about questions and smash their skulls in while they're asleep?
As I pondered this, Misha whispered, "Bjorn, we might be able to find out what happened to the Hikurod side."
Well, that was true.  Talking to them might be a good idea.  But first, I needed to set the stage for conversation.
"Let's knock them all out and tie them up with rope."
"Good idea," she agreed.
With that settled, I sent Misha into the cabin, ensuring she could subdue them before they woke up.
"..."
I believe our preparations are complete.  I exchanged a glance with Misha through the window and nodded.  Raising my mace above my head, I brought it down.
Wham!
I only used half my strength.  As expected, the religious fanatic slumped over, unable to even let out a dying moan.  I wiped the blood and flesh from my clothes and exhaled deeply.
"One down," I thought.
Time to knock out the next one.  I crept into the cabin, where the other two lay in a stupor, their dreams taking them far away.  So, which one first?
As I was considering this, one of them shifted in his sleep.
"Ugh..."
Perfect.  You're next.  Just as I was about to bring my mace down, Misha rushed over, grabbing my arm, her voice hushed, "We agreed to knock them out, not kill them!"
I cocked my head.  And then, I realized the meaning of her words.  I nodded.
"Don't worry," I said.
Even in fighting games, low jumps were my specialty.  I'm confident in my ability to control my strength.  Of course, if they die, they die.  That's how the world works, right?
Wham!
My mace connected, sending the man lounging in the rocking chair limp.  And at the same moment, a sound echoed from within the cabin.
"Who—who is—"
One of the men in the bed had sprung up, startled.  But it didn't matter.  Awake or asleep, my mace treats them all equally.
Wham!
Without even needing to creep closer, I dashed forward and slammed my mace into the man's face, using only half my strength.  Since the goal was to knock him out, the move had a name...
"Bash would work," I decided.
The "Bash" was successful.  First phase of the operation complete.  I turned to Misha.
"What are you waiting for? Tie them up with rope."
She looked at the three bloodied figures, her eyes widening. "Do we really need to tie them up...?"
Well, I suppose...  But you can never be too careful.  That's my motto.
***
"Wow, they're really alive..."
Thankfully, the three men survived their mace encounter.
"I told you, don't worry—"
"But they're going to die soon," Misha stated.
"..."
They all had labored breathing, their breaths becoming shallower, as if they were on the verge of death.  The man who had been hit in the face was the worst.  But as long as they were still alive, it wasn't a problem.  This was a fantasy world, after all.
"There it is."
I grabbed a random backpack and pulled out a potion.  I sprinkled the potion onto the heads of the unconscious men.  A little at a time, since I didn't want them to become too energetic.
Hiss-
Their reactions varied in time.
"Aaaagh!!! Aaaaaaaaaagh!"
"Huuuaaagghh!!"
Their cracked skulls began to heal, and the three men writhed on the lawn like fish out of water.  I dragged out the rocking chair, sat down, and waited for them to regain consciousness.
"You barbaric brute..."
Misha muttered her condemnation, but what could I do?  Whether they were deceived by Elissa or not, they had tried to kill us once.  And the heart of a Barbarian like Bjorn doesn't easily feel sympathy for enemies.
"You, you...!"
"That Barbarian!"
"It's a misunderstanding! We're not your enemies!"
They regained consciousness, and all three started talking at once, making it a chaotic mess.
"One at a time."
I mumbled as I wiped my mace on a cloth.  Silence fell upon the group.  The three men looked at each other, their eyes reaching a silent agreement.
"My good sir, it was all a misunderstanding. A misunderstanding!"
The leader, the religious fanatic, was chosen as their representative.
"I can explain everything. Just loosen—!"
"Enough. What was the misunderstanding?"
When I asked, the religious fanatic looked as if he'd been wronged.  He began to speak, pouring his heart out.
"That woman! We were merely pawns in her game. We didn't even know she was a follower of the accursed Karui...!"
Oh, you know now, do you?  Seems like something did happen, after all.
"So, first things first, untie me, and then we can discuss this calmly..."
"That's enough about that."
What matters now isn't how much they've suffered or how unjustly they've been treated.
"Tell me, from beginning to end. What happened after we escaped? What happened to you?"
Confirmation of cause and effect.  That, and only that, is why I used "Bash" instead of "Smash."
"Well, you see..."
"Don't even try to be clever."
"I understand, sir. It was ultimately our mistake for trusting that woman, but I will tell you everything without holding back."
"Whether you've held back anything or not is for me to decide."
The religious fanatic swallowed nervously.  He then began to spill the details of a story I knew nothing about.
"When we finally caught up to those evil women, there were only three left."
Well, that's obvious.  They were right there when we got separated.
Click-clack.
This really makes my teeth grind.  How can such a ridiculous coincidence happen?
"Continue..."
"We couldn't let them escape, so we ambushed the man who looked like an explorer.  He was injured."
"You mean, Rotmiller?!"
"I don't know his name. But don't worry, that wound won't be fatal."
So, putting the pieces together, this is what happened.  Rotmiller was incapacitated during the ambush.  The dwarves must have realized they needed to take out the opposing explorer to secure their own escape.
"I don't know exactly what happened, but there was a flash of light, and then it pushed us back."
"When I came to, Anderson was impaled by an ice spear."
"Anderson, that's the name of one of our explorers."
"He wasn't the kind of guy who'd get caught like that..."
"They had the advantage in numbers, and they might have been caught off guard.  He probably didn't have time to dodge."
However, that delay gave the dwarves time to act.  Dwaki killed the opposing explorer.  And then, without looking back, he escaped with the injured Rotmiller.
Hearing this, Misha slapped my back.
"See!  It was all thanks to Hikurod!  He was thinking about us and killed the explorer!"
Well, I don't know about the dwarf's true motives.  But it's undeniable that we're still alive thanks to his actions.  Regardless, back to the main point.
"Anderson died, so we couldn't even pursue them.  We were lost in this forest, just like you."
Their pursuit of us, which had been full of excitement, fizzled out after the death of their explorer, leaving them in a similar predicament to ours.  Of course, they were still in a better position than us.  They had five members, including a priest.  But...
"Two days after we got lost..."
Day two of being stranded.  They were taking turns acting as lookouts and replenishing their energy.  That's when Elissa revealed her true colors and killed another one of them.
"We knew instantly.  We saw that guy withered and emaciated, his life force being sucked away.  That woman, she's a worshiper of the accursed Karui!"
"Enough. Why did she kill your friend?"
"I don't know that either.  We were so traumatized by the horrific sight, we just wanted to escape and warn the world about her."
Bullshit.  You just wanted to survive, even if it meant abandoning your comrade.
Anyway, I skipped the rest of the story.  It was no different from what Misha and I had experienced, except for the number of them.
"So, we've cleared up any misunderstandings. Now, please, untie—!"
"I told you, stop with that," I sighed.
This was the third time he asked to be released.
"Bjorn, what do we do now?"
"Ahem, seeing as we're in the same boat, perhaps we should cooperate?"
"Shut your trap."
My mind raced.  Of course, I had no intention of accepting his proposal and joining forces for the remaining two days.  But...
"By the way, I haven't apologized yet! I'm sorry! We were foolish to fall for that woman's tricks. We're truly sorry!"
There's an opportunity here.  Could I really call these guys "scumbags"?  They caused us a lot of trouble, but no one ended up dead, in the end.  And the dwarves seem to be alive, too.  But... should I really kill them?
"Bjorn, I'll do whatever you say."
I've killed many people.  But back then, it was a matter of life and death.  And they were trash with no redemption.  What about these guys?  It's complicated.  As I said before, there's an opportunity.  The spirit of a modern-day human, not yet fully rid of its old habits, is hesitant to make a decision.
"What are you thinking about?! It was a mistake! We never thought a priest could lie—"
"Quiet. If you keep going, I'm going to accidentally crush your head."
"..."
I was curt in my reply, to avoid appearing vulnerable.  But inside, the conflict raged on.  Is it right to kill them?
Finally, I asked myself the question.  Bjorn Jandel, the Barbarian warrior, answered.
["Does right or wrong even matter?  Killing them would be easy.  Why would I leave trouble for myself?"]
What a truly brutal response.  Lee Hansoo, a 29-year-old born in Seoul, also chimed in.
["You idiot, what are you hesitating for?  Killing someone for a mistake is obviously wrong.  But..."]
For once, they were in agreement.
["That's how things worked in our world."]
Killing someone for a mistake?  That's just not right.  If this were the place I was born and raised...
Clank-
That's why I gripped my mace.  But would I have hesitated even then?  Without thinking, I blurted out, "Misha, what do you think?"
Misha, born and raised here, responded, "I don't trust these guys."
"So?"
"They tried to kill us once, whether it was a mistake or not.  My father taught me that you never forgive people who try to kill you."
Oh, right.  That's how it is here.  That's how it should be.  My mind cleared like fog dissipating.  When in Rome, do as the Romans do.  It's simple.  Because otherwise, you might die.
Whoosh.
That's why I lifted my mace.
"It was a mistake! We said it was a mistake!"
The religious fanatic, lying on the ground, cried out.
"Mistake..."
I nodded.  It might have been a mistake.  But for some reason, I just have a feeling you guys will make another one.
Kwang!
I brought down my mace.  As if to erase any hesitation, I used all my strength.
Kwang!
Again.
Kwang!
Three swings of the mace, and the surroundings fell silent.
[Achievement unlocked]
Condition: 10 kills.
Reward: Permanent +1 increase to mental fortitude.
I wasn't seeking justification for my actions.  If I were, I would have laid a trap and waited for them to make a "mistake."  The more "scumbags" I kill, the better it is for my mental health.  But...
"I guess it's time to leave all that behind."
From the very first day I opened my eyes in this world, I knew.
"Bjorn Jandel."
I have to live with this name.  No, not just the name, but I have to become this Barbarian completely.  It's the only way to survive here.
Drip-drip.
The blood and flesh clinging to my mace fell away.
"Bjorn...  Are you okay? Your hand is shaking."
The weak die.  Those who make mistakes die.  And those who have bad luck die.  That's this world.
"Don't worry.  I'm fine."
The trembling in my hand stopped.  I stripped the religious fanatic of his gear.  Then, dragging his body, clad only in his underwear, I entered the cabin.
"What—what are you doing?!"
Misha asked in horror.  I answered, "Doing what needs to be done."
Something I have to do, even if I don't want to.  Without hesitation, I tossed the body onto the dying fire.
Whoosh!
The flames roared back to life.  And with them came a repulsive smell.  Well, I only *thought* it was repulsive.  The Barbarian's palate is incapable of distinguishing the stench of burning flesh from the smell of roasted meat.
Whoosh!
I exhaled as I watched the intensified flames.  This part is consistent with the game, too.
[A new offering has been made.]
[The Witch's Cabin's duration has been extended by 8 hours.]
With two more logs left, I can stay in the cabin for at least 24 hours.  "Go on, get some rest."
I climbed onto the bed, saying those words.  Misha said something back, but frankly, I wasn't listening.
"...Comfortable."
I closed my eyes and mindlessly counted from one.  My weary body finally found solace, and I drifted into sleep.
Thump, thump, thump.  The sound of the crackling fire gradually faded from my consciousness.
"You gotta sleep in a bed."
It wasn't even ironic anymore.  The more I shed my modern-day identity, the more I felt like I was becoming human in this place.
