Chapter 46: The Line (3)
Tarikan Riyen.
Of course, that wouldn't be his real name, but anyway.
'First, I should give him something to eat and talk to him.'
The inn wasn't far, so I took him to my room and bought dinner from downstairs.
The menu was the 300-stone daily special, by the way.
Chicken stew, a few slices of bread, and some roasted vegetables were all it included, but it was enough to make him incredibly grateful.
However, there was one thing that bothered me…
“I'll never forget this kindness!”
Ugh, what is with this clumsy barbarian accent?
I'm glad he's finally regaining his senses, but if he's going to do it, he should do it right.
He lacks confidence, and his voice is small.
Our barbarians are much more energetic when someone buys them food.
'…But he eats well. Maybe he's starving?'
I smiled bitterly, watching him wolf down the food.
It was because of one fact I learned from the short conversation we had after the meal.
'I can't believe it wasn't a newbie…'
Surprisingly, this man was my senior.
Just a month older, though.
He was summoned to this world a month before I opened my eyes in Bjorn's body.
And here's another surprising fact.
“R-Rite of Passage? Oh, I was so shocked back then. Who would've thought there would be a, a fiend among us?”
'A fiend, huh…'
Coincidentally, this man and I had similar beginnings.
A fiend at his Rite of Passage too.
That is, an event where a player is executed by the tribe leader.
And here's one question that comes to mind.
'How did he survive that?'
At the Rite of Passage, your name is called out.
However, when you awaken, the fiend has no information about this body. So, every time the tribe leader called out a name, I had to count silently in the suffocating tension.
'…But did he even get suspected of anything, even if he didn't cause a ruckus?'
Well, maybe not.
Or, maybe he used a similar strategy to mine and didn't get suspected.
I was curious, so I subtly asked, but the answer was a bit disappointing.
“What number were you called at the Rite of Passage? I don't know why you're asking… But I think it was last!”
I see. It was the last turn, huh.
Then he wouldn't have needed to know his name.
There wouldn't have been any warriors left.
I couldn't help but think he was lucky, but he didn't even realize how lucky he was.
Geez, what a jerk.
“So, what happened after that?”
“W-What happened, you ask? That is… Why are you curious?”
Of course, why?
Because I'm a fiend too.
It's research, research.
“I might help you if your situation is dire after hearing your story.”
I intentionally answered vaguely.
However, he may have already assumed that I would help him.
“I-I see! Then I'll tell you my story!”
He didn't hide his expectant gaze and began to slowly unravel his story.
From the day he opened his eyes in Tarikan Riyen's body to this day.
After hearing his story, it was more self-inflicted than just pitiful.
“…So, you didn't enter the Labyrinth after the Rite of Passage?”
“T-That's because it couldn't be helped! I got lost along the way…”
He didn't enter the Labyrinth.
He claimed to have gotten lost, but…
'I can filter that part out.'
The real reason was probably that fighting monsters felt like madness.
On the other hand, leaving the excited barbarian horde would have been extremely easy.
The problem would have been what came after.
Left in the city, he spent a week eating stone bread and went around looking for work, but nowhere would hire him because he was a barbarian.
'It's practically the biggest drawback of being a barbarian.'
Other races can have side jobs.
For example, you can find humanoids working as servers in taverns, and you can occasionally see dwarves working at blacksmiths.
They mine for gems on days the Labyrinth opens and earn money by working in the city during the month they spend there.
Unlike barbarians, who have no options other than combat.
“Didn't you know that? It's something you learn at the Holy Land.”
“T-That is… I forgot for a moment! And, I told you, didn't I? I got lost and couldn't help it…”
So, that's a lie, you know.
I asked him that because I was asking him in a roundabout way, saying that it was something you learn at the Holy Land, but it's a setting that you should know if you've played the game.
'But to answer like that…'
I'm starting to have doubts.
Is it really true that he's referring to the 'fiends,' the beings who opened the 'Gate of the Abyss,' the final layer?
Someone with that level of skill should have known the barbarian setting.
“…Can you keep going?”
“Oh, sorry. Go on.”
Anyway, the story returned to the main point.
After enduring hunger for days, he sold his starting weapon for 50,000 stones.
I don't know who the buyer was, but he was a real smartass.
A barbarian's starting weapon costs an average of 150,000 stones.
'Well, the really important part is something else, I guess.'
He saved the little money he had and spent a month somehow.
And the next Labyrinth entrance time.
In other words, the day I woke up in this body and decided to enter the Labyrinth.
“Huh! You didn't even enter the Labyrinth that day? Are you out of your mind?”
“But how can you fight monsters without weapons!”
No, you should have just gone in.
You're supposed to be a player who reached the 'Gate of the Abyss,' right?
Can't you even make that kind of judgment?
“B-Besides, I ate something bad that day and my stomach hurt!”
'I'm speechless.'
My head is spinning.
'I can't just outright ask him if he actually played the game…'
Now that I think about it, I don't even know if all the fiends, including this guy, are from the same Earth as me.
It's a world where monsters exist and magic is real. It's possible that the setting includes fiends from other dimensions.
“Just keep talking.”
I had a feeling there wouldn't be anything different, but I listened to the rest of the story.
Of course, it didn't differ much from my expectations.
He ran out of money, got kicked out of the inn, and continued to fight hunger, cold, sickness, and disease.
One day, he heard about a lodging where barbarians gather and went to see if he could get help, but for some reason, he was rejected…
“Speaking of which, you're quite peculiar! Everyone just looked at me strangely.”
To be honest, I find him more peculiar.
How can he act so carefree and still survive for three months?
'Or should I be proud of him for realizing on his own that he needs to act like a barbarian?'
Every choice he made was incomprehensible, yet somehow comforting.
If I had made different choices back then…
'I probably wouldn't have been much different.'
If I had chosen to run away that day because I was afraid to fight…
“…How much is it here per day?”
I would have been sleeping on the street, not in an inn with windows and a private bathroom.
And I wouldn't have been able to eat stone bread, let alone stew. I would have had to rummage through trash cans—
“Oh, how was my story? Wasn't it pitiful?”
He might have had to rely on others' sympathy by revealing his own misfortune.
I hesitated again before answering.
And I made my decision.
“It was definitely a pitiful story.”
“So, you'll help me?”
His face lit up instantly.
“O-Of course, I'll repay you. You won't believe me, but I know the Labyrinth very well! If you come with me, you'll be a great help!”
A great help?
'The way he talks makes me think he knows a bit about this world…'
I can almost feel the future he's imagining in his head.
He's probably imagining going into the Labyrinth with me and becoming a team.
He might be genuinely saying those words because he wants to repay me.
He doesn't know my true identity.
But let me cut him off right now—
“I won't go into the Labyrinth with you.”
That kind of future is absolutely not happening.
I'm in a tight spot myself, so why would I take on a burden with someone who's in a similar situation and go into the Labyrinth?
Why would I do something that crazy?
“You said you would help me earlier!”
I could hear some anger in his voice. I tried to swallow my bitter smile.
“I'll help you in a different way.”
“A different way?”
“Here, this is 150,000 stones. Buy a weapon with this and enter the Labyrinth.”
I took out three 50,000 stone bills and placed them in his hand. His face brightened again.
“Are you really giving me this for free? Thank you! I'll definitely repay this kindness!”
I'm not expecting him to repay it at all.
With this money, he'll probably have a hard time surviving for long with that attitude.
The Labyrinth I experienced wasn't something you could easily navigate just with game knowledge.
But I gave him 150,000 stones.
I gave him the money knowing that this act wouldn't benefit me in any way.
“Well, I'm tired, so go ahead and leave.”
“Oh, I-I see! Okay! I'll come back—”
“Don't come back.”
I spoke again, making sure he understood, my voice low.
“Tarikan, son of Riyen, whether you waste this money or lose it, whether you survive the Labyrinth or make a lot of money, even if things go well and you have the means to repay your kindness—”
I walked closer and placed my hand on his shoulder. He flinched.
I could feel his surprise through my fingertips, but I didn't stop talking.
“It doesn't matter for any reason. Leave this room today and never come back to me. And answer if you understand. Got it?”
“…I got it.”
After getting his confirmation, I forcibly kicked him out of the room. I stretched out on the bed and replayed my actions in my head.
I let out a chuckle.
'Well, maybe it brought back old memories?'
Maybe I was reminded of my past when I desperately needed someone's help.
But even with that in mind…
'Even I think what I did was utterly repulsive.'
Someone calculating would surely consider me foolish for this.
Someone emotional would feel cheated, thinking that this was all I could do to help.
They're not wrong.
I lacked both the coldness to retreat far from the line and the recklessness to cross it.
So I stopped right on the line.
'This is clearly hypocrisy, isn't it?'
I closed my eyes.
And I thought again.
No matter how hypocritical my actions today were—
“Tarikan, try to survive as long as you can.”
This was my best.
It was something I couldn't have done if I had no money.
***
The next morning.
I visited the Explorer's Guild branch I had visited yesterday.
Unfortunately, the receptionist was different…
“Five stars…?”
The female receptionist, after checking my Identity Card, changed her expression like yesterday's staff member and treated me politely.
What the hell is this?
Did the branch head do something to my Identity Card?
I asked the receptionist out of curiosity, but I didn't get a clear answer.
“Stars? Did I say that? I don't think I did.”
You're pretending not to know, now?
I didn't press further.
It's probably a code they use only within the guild.
Like VIP or something they attach to problem customers.
Suddenly, I wondered which one I was…
'Whichever one it is, I benefit.'
VIP or high-class problem customer, it doesn't matter.
The outcome is the same: I get polite treatment.
“Here's a list of teams that meet your requirements. Would you like to take a look, Explorer?”
I checked today's notice for the same requirements as yesterday.
It was almost the same, except for a few new teams added.
'Maybe I can find a proper team today?'
I focused on the newly added teams and examined the documents, stopping at one part.
It was because I saw a familiar name.
[3rd Floor Exploration - Hikurod Murad]
Preferred Exploration Area: None, to be decided through later discussions.
Average Rank: Undetermined.
Current Members: 1 Close Combat Defense Dwarf Warrior (7th Rank)
Members Needed: 4 (Role irrelevant, may vary depending on team composition)
*Equal Distribution
'Hikurod Murad for a team leader?'
He's a dwarf.
It doesn't seem like a case of mistaken identity.
'Did his original team disband?'
Whatever the reason, it's not bad.
It's a bit weird that there aren't any members yet, but at least the leader is someone you can trust.
'I'm curious about what Number Item he ate in 'Bloodstained Castle.''
'I should meet him first.'
After briefly filling out an application form and submitting it to the administrator, I left the building and headed for the commercial district.
I'm sure we'll meet, at the latest, the day after tomorrow.
'Then I should go spend some money first.'
I was convinced.
It was bound to be the most enjoyable time I've had recently.
'Wait… have I ever had any fun?'
I decided not to worry about petty things.
