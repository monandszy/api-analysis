Chapter 29, The Crack (3)
In [Dungeon and Stone], it’s common for internal conflicts to arise.
And the reason for these “internal conflicts” is almost always “money.”
While a wealthy mage might prioritize research, adventurers enter the maze solely for profit.
But this mage, this woman, had just touched upon that very sensitive issue.
“You want to keep all the Guardian’s loot?”
The dwarf no longer wore his friendly smile.
His voice was low, and his eyes, visible beneath a thick layer of fur, gleamed with a dangerous intensity.
“Do you think I'm an idiot?”
The air instantly turned icy cold.
Sensing this, the human man placed his hand on the hilt of his sword.
He wasn’t a mere transporter, after all.
Breaking the heavy silence, Raven spoke.
“…But I’ll give you all the magic stones that come out of the crack.”
“You want us to pick up the scraps, huh?”
“…I think this is a reasonable calculation. Those stones aren't guaranteed to appear anyway.”
She tried to hide it, but her face clearly showed her surprise.
She hadn’t expected such a hostile reaction.
…Naive woman.
She should have anticipated this.
The Guardian’s loot was the heart of the crack.
Among them, the ‘Number Item’ was a treasure beyond compare to the dwarf.
“I can't let go of the Number Item.”
“…Alright, then I’ll take the Guardian’s essence. And I’ll claim ownership of any other discoveries made using my knowledge.”
“Fine. Then we’ll decide who gets the crack stones by rolling dice fairly.”
Ha, fairness, my foot.
The two of them, completely ignoring me and Einar, started a power struggle between themselves.
Watching them was a headache.
I even thought it might have been better to clear the crack with the first-floor newbies, even if it meant bloodshed.
If things continued like this, I’d be lucky to get a few crumbs from this crack.
It was so frustrating being powerless.
“Bjorn.”
“I know what you’re thinking, but stay quiet for now.”
“Understood.”
My tasks became clearer.
I need to become stronger.
Whether these bastards kick away the ladder or not, I have to climb to the top, no matter how hard it is.
That’s how I can protect my own rights, just like them.
Of course, that doesn't mean I have to give in today.
“Wait.”
“…?”
As I spoke, the two, previously engaged in a conversation with a slightly softer tone, turned their attention to me.
“You guys can fight over the essence and Number Item. But we'll take the crack stones.”
“You’re getting greedy.”
“Do you think two barbarians will be a problem?”
My gaze was sharp.
Damn it, at our first meeting, everyone was so friendly.
Well, I was just testing the waters.
“Fine, we’ll give up on the crack stones. But give us priority over the essence, excluding the Guardian’s, for up to two items.”
“Okay, that much is acceptable.”
“I agree.”
As expected, Raven and the dwarf easily agreed to my request.
That was my limit.
For their level, the essence, excluding the Guardian’s, wouldn’t be that attractive.
“Shall we head out then?”
“Good, I was already getting stiff from standing still! Hahaha!”
Once the negotiation was done, the mage and the dwarf were back to their friendly selves, laughing and joking as if nothing had happened.
Scary adventurers.
***
After climbing up the mountain path along the fortress visible through the mountain peaks, we arrived at the entrance. There, we encountered two winged demon statues.
“Gargoyle statues.”
8th grade monster, Gargoyle Statues.
Normally they are inert, but when they detect an enemy, they use ‘Petrification’ to activate. They are tricky monsters.
The typical strategy is for one member to sacrifice themselves and absorb all the ‘Petrification’, while the rest kill the gargoyle and break the curse…
But luckily, we had a mage with us.
“Kyaaaaaaaaaaak—!”
As I and the dwarf approached, the gargoyle opened its eyes and spread its wings.
Simultaneously, my lower body instantly turned to stone, but the duration was short.
“Artena Viar.”
Raven uttered a ‘Curse Removal’ spell, and the battle began in earnest.
I and Einar took on one, while the dwarf took the other.
Kwang!
The short dwarf swung his hammer like a madman, crushing both legs of the gargoyle.
As the gargoyle fell to the ground, he smashed its head with a powerful blow, as if he had been waiting for this moment.
Is that the dwarf way?
Crushing things from the bottom up seems quite manly.
Well, it was a bit hypocritical, but that’s how it was.
“You guys are pretty good!”
The time it took us to completely obliterate the gargoyle statues was similar.
We were also confident in close combat.
「Gargoyle slain. EXP +2」
The two gargoyles disappeared in a flash of light, dropping magic stones, but we didn’t have to pick them up.
They automatically floated up and went into a large sack.
“I’ll collect the magic stones and distribute them in between.”
“Then I’m grateful for that! Hahaha!”
The dwarf didn’t seem worried that the mage would steal them.
After all, a mage wouldn’t be interested in this kind of petty cash.
“Let’s go!”
The dwarf smashed the old wooden door with his hammer, opening the way.
This was where the real dungeon started.
I felt a strange sensation as I followed him.
“We’ll need light.”
“Re-light.”
A sphere of light appeared in Raven’s hand, illuminating the dark interior.
The current location was the outer checkpoint.
The place where they would have performed administrative tasks like checking the carriage’s cargo or the identity of passersby before allowing them into the castle.
“Grrrrrr.”
As if drawn by the light and sound, rotten corpses rose from the wardrobes on the walls, or under the desks, approaching us.
“Dead Men.”
Dead Men.
A no-grade monster that didn’t give experience points or even magic stones.
And they don’t even disappear, except when they drop essence.
“Their only attacks are biting and scratching, so I’ll save my magic.”
There was no help from magic, but it didn’t take long to clear the room.
“While I open the door, Muradt and Yandell, you guys go upstairs, alright?”
“We’ll handle this quickly! Hahaha!”
Following the dwarf up to the second floor, we found a communal bedroom.
We encountered a dozen Dead Men, but since the space was wider than on the first floor, clearing them was easier.
Poof! Poof!
After swiftly dealing with the second floor, we went up to the roof without further discussion.
There were a dozen Dead Man soldiers wearing rusty armor and a larger-bodied Dead Man commander.
He was a bit too strong to be considered the first boss…
But a boss we had to defeat to proceed.
“He might be big, but he's no different from other Dead Men. Finish him off quickly! Hahaha!”
We finished off the surroundings quickly, and this time we searched the commander’s clothes and found a horn.
Back on the first floor, the iron gate on the opposite side was open.
“Having a mage with us is quite reassuring.”
With light coming in from both sides, the room without windows became bright, but it didn’t matter.
We were done with the outer checkpoint.
Now it was time to cross a 50-meter bridge.
“Be careful of your steps, Raven.”
“Oh, thanks.”
The bridge was broken in several places, leaving about 20 meters from the gate.
It wasn’t broken by age or anything.
It was designed that way from the start.
Poooooooooow!
I blew the horn I’d gotten in advance, and with a clattering sound, the drawbridge started to descend.
But it wasn’t the only thing…
「The dormant water-blocking magic circle activates.」
“Bjorn! The water is rising below!”
A moat.
Water began to rise from the ditches surrounding the walls to prevent external invasion.
Black and blood-red water.
That’s why this place was called the ‘Blood-Stained Fortress’.
The sky was red, and the ground was red.
But what truly heightened the apocalyptic atmosphere was…
“Bjorn! Hands! There are hands splashing above the water!”
“They’re Dead Men, don’t worry.”
“Huh, who said I was worried?”
As the blood-red water reached the base of the bridge, Dead Men that had been splashing on the surface crawled up.
The drawbridge had only come down about 1/5.
The concept of this part was simple.
—Survive until the drawbridge comes down.
If it was a game, that’s the message that would have appeared.
“Grrrrrr.”
Although there were no specific instructions, everyone knew what to do, pushing the Dead Men back or stabbing them with their weapons.
Poof! Poof! Kwak-!
They were no-grade monsters, Dead Men, but here on the bridge, they were a tricky opponent.
If you fell off, it was game over.
“I’m done.”
After about a minute, Raven finished her magic incantation.
“Witerna Dertu!”
Translated literally, the spell’s name is something like ‘Blade Storm’.
A strong gust of wind erupted from the center of our tightly packed formation, shredding the Dead Men like a blender.
Tududududu.
Looking at the bridge, now covered in the corpses of Dead Men, the dwarf exclaimed.
“…Impressive.”
“It’s just Dead Men.”
Her words were humble, but Raven’s eyes were full of pride.
But it didn’t feel like arrogance.
Without a mage with area-of-effect spells, this part wouldn’t be this easy.
After that, we just crushed the Dead Men that occasionally crawled up onto the bridge, when finally, the drawbridge, slowly descending, touched the bridge.
Kuung!
The first chapter of Blood-Stained Fortress was over.
Humiliatingly easy.
***
We had crossed the drawbridge, leaving three chapters left.
The outer wall’s city battle.
The inner wall’s dungeon.
The lord’s castle’s demon worship room.
“This is… intriguing.”
Entering the castle, Raven looked at the ruins and her eyes shone.
As if she had discovered treasure.
“Forges, pubs, inns, churches, stables… Most of these ruins seem to be public facilities.”
The dwarf chuckled.
“Is that so surprising, Raven?”
“Of course, we didn’t see any farmland or housing along the mountain path or inside the castle. It means there were no farmers. Isn’t that curious? What did these people eat in this fortress city built in such a remote mountain range?”
“There must have been alchemists in this dimension too. Like us, they probably turned magic stones into bread. Hahaha!”
“…That hypothesis is the most dominant among scholars.”
“Hahaha! Really? Even learned people have similar thoughts!”
“But Muradt, that’s not the only interesting point. The long drawbridge and the high walls, they were all built with great practicality. Who were their enemies?”
At first, the dwarf was receptive, but as the conversation dragged on, he began to feel uncomfortable and distanced himself.
“I have no idea why you’re curious about that. It’s all just made up space anyway.”
“Made up space, people who haven't properly studied dimensional science might think that way—“
“Enough, Raven, monsters are coming.”
As we passed through the city streets toward the inner castle, monsters soon appeared.
Dead Men, Skeleton Archers, Mages, Ghouls, and even 8th grade monsters, Death Spins.
The level of the monsters appearing wasn’t much different from the land of the dead, but the scale was significantly different.
Each group had at least a few dozen monsters.
“Everyone, gather around me.”
And if we encountered one group, another would approach, attracted by the sound.
Within a minute of encountering the first group, hundreds of monsters surrounded us.
But at that moment, the ‘Blade Storm’ we had seen earlier swept across the area again.
Swaaaaaaaaaa—!
The area-of-effect spell, as effective as it was for bullying, didn’t wipe them all out this time.
A few ghouls survived with only a severed limb or two, and the Death Spin, a symbol of defense and regeneration, was obviously untouched.
But…
“I’ll leave the rest to you.”
The fact that almost 90% of the Dead Men and Skeletons had been wiped out was proof enough that she had done several people’s worth of work.
“Einar!!”
I shouted, and Einar ran towards us.
Our target was the Death Spin.
The method of hunting…
There was no need for further explanation.
A single shared glance was enough.
“Behel—laaaaaaaaaa!!”
Through hundreds of coordinated breaths, we had reached a point where mistakes were rare.
The name: (True) Double Barbarian Tackle.
Kung!
We lifted both legs and slammed them down, then crushed the Death Spin’s head.
Seeing us, the dwarf was shocked.
“…Do you always hunt like this?”
He looked as if he was thinking, ‘What kind of barbarians are these?’
“Is there a problem?”
“No, it’s…quite a spectacular, spectacular way to hunt, for barbarians! Ha, ha, ha!”
It wasn’t embarrassing now, but it was a little funny.
After all, the dwarf’s fighting style wasn’t exactly graceful.
“Rabiod Ehelitun.”
There were still seven Death Spins, but Raven added a ‘Wounds Aggravation Curse’, making it easy to hunt them.
The Death Spins, with their ‘Physical Preservation’ passive skill sealed, were not that tough.
“Now I understand why everyone thinks mages are great… .”
Had he realized the impact of a single mage through just two battles?
Einar muttered in a lifeless voice.
Raven didn’t respond, but I noticed a twitch at the corner of her mouth.
She seemed pleased to be admired.
The dwarf also added his opinion.
“Hahaha! You’re right, having a mage with us definitely expands our range of actions.”
I agreed.
If we had been a party of five newbies in ‘Blood-Stained Fortress’, we wouldn’t have even considered a head-on fight.
We would have slowly reduced the number of monsters from the outside, even if it took dozens of times longer.
“Hmm, well… that’s why I study so hard. Of course, talent is necessary too.”
Raven blushed slightly at the continued praise.
Her character is finally taking shape.
A talented mage who likes to show off, while pretending to be humble, and more than anything, passionate about magic and research.
I’m starting to get a sense of how to handle her.
“So, I’m going to take some research materials from around here. Would you mind helping me?”
“Raven, you saved us some time, so of course we’ll help. Hahaha!”
“Thank you.”
We then searched the ruins of the city, collecting antiques, books, soil, metal, Dead Man flesh, and bones.
“Thanks to all of you, we finished early. Let’s move on to the next part!”
I stared blankly for a moment.
What? Wait, we’re done?
We killed all the monsters and searched the area, why aren’t we taking it?
“What are you doing there! Come on.”
…Could it be they don’t know?
The easy-to-find thing that appears when you break the fountain statue?
