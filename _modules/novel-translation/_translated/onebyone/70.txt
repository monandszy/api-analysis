Chapter 70 Barbarian Hero (3)
I'm running with all my might, dragging a monstrously large body behind me, a body that's 5 meters in diameter.
Boom! Boom!
Every time my feet hit the ground, a sound like a colossal monster's footsteps reverberates.
“Don't fall behind, keep up!”
Behind me are 23 clan members and Misha, followed by 40 third-floor explorers who haven’t been swayed by Jack Fletcher’s machinations.
The reason they've joined us is simple.
[If you surrender all your equipment, I will take you with me.]
Macgrain, being a pragmatist, wanted to minimize any losses, and...
[Character has cast [Offering Imprint]]
[The character's physical stats will temporarily increase in proportion to the number of offerings within a 100-meter radius.]
The more offerings, the better.
“Behel—Laaaaaaaaaaaaa!!”
My strength overflows. The primal instinct to destroy, as potent as the strength surging within, takes control of my whole body.
‘This, it must be due to my fighting spirit.’
Thank goodness. I don't have to suppress this urge.
“Kyaaah—!”
Riachis' miniature clones swarm forward from the front.
They may be miniature, but they're still over 2 meters tall...
They're still small, though.
Whoom!
I swing my mace relentlessly. It feels like I'm wielding a spoon instead of a mace, because my body has become so huge.
Well, the guys on the receiving end probably have a different opinion.
Wham-!
A clone, struck in the chest, disintegrates into dust.
If it were the old me, it would have taken several hits to kill it.
I realize how much my physical stats have been boosted.
The problem, however, is...
Kaboom-!
Every time I shatter a clone, an explosion erupts.
Not from where the clone dies, but from where I stand.
[Riachis' Hatred is activated]
[The character suffers significant Chaotic attribute damage]
This is why a main tank is crucial in the [Gap of Evil] pattern. These self-destructing clones deal guaranteed damage to whoever kills them.
In other words, no matter how skilled a swordsman or renowned an archer,  if all they have is damage, they’re useless here.
Kaboom-!
The level of damage that would have instantly killed a weakling mage.
My entire body tingles.
Even with my pain resistance, it's this intense. If it were before, I would have screamed with every explosion.
Sizzle—!
The black liquid plastered all over my body melts away in a plume of smoke.
In the damaged areas, muscles are already dissolving, revealing the bone beneath.
It's not a problem, though.
I'm a Dark Barbarian, inheriting the legacy of the vampire.
[Due to the passive skill [Dark Origin], the character will not die until the heart is destroyed.]
All I need to do is protect my heart.
Well, at this rate, it might be a matter of time...
Clang!
As I clear a path by pulverizing the clones, countless glass bottles keep flying at me.
Meanwhile, the priests, scrambling to catch up, are pouring all their healing power into me.
“That was close! Don't try to kill too many at once!”
“Behel—Laaaaaaaaaaaaa!!”
“If you hear me, answer!”
It’s not as easy as it sounds, you know.
In [Gigantification] state, the threat level, or in other words, the probability of attracting a monster's aggro, increases with size.
And for a Barbarian, who is inherently large, the increase is insane.
It's practically a permanent taunt mode.
The reason the explorers following me can move comfortably is because of this.
They’re all focused on me.
“Hey!! Can't you hear—”
“I hear you.”
Still, following Macgrain's advice, I slow my pace. The guy who's Misha’s brother, along with another melee warrior, triggers clone explosions right behind me.
However...
“Priest! What are the priests doing! Heal, heal!”
They barely take out two or three before throwing a fit.
It's not reassuring at all.
I don’t like the fact that the priest’s healing is dispersed.
Most importantly, if I adjust my pace, I can't maximize the passive effect.
[The character's health is below 50%]
[Passive skill [Hero’s Path] increases all resistances and immune values]
The passive skill [Hero’s Path] of the Orc Hero.
This skill, which activates when health drops below half, boosts all kinds of defense values.
And from my research…
‘The maximum effect applied when health was below 20%, right?’
That's why I needed an Orc Hero essence in the first place.
It doesn't matter what color essence it is; the passive effect is the same.
“Enough, both of you, fall back.”
“What? I can still—”
Hey, don’t you dare try to imitate the role of the noble tank, you measly dealer.
“There could be something behind us as well.”
I coaxed the two dealers into the rear with kind words.
Macgrain, who was watching from behind, didn't say much this time. He simply shouted, 
“We only have 10 minutes left. It’s crucial going forward, so try your best for a little longer.”
Yeah, stay there and cheer us on.
***
Tailon Calstain, a 5th-grade explorer.
As he retreated from the front line, a middle-aged man approached him.
“Oh, you’re here now?”
“Yes, Herrneshion.”
Tailon nodded, and Anton Herrneshion, the mage of his regular team 7, lit up.
“Yes, the deputy commander made a good decision. We need to be careful about what might appear from behind, don’t you think?”
“Yes, I agree…”
Tailon swallowed his bitter emotions and answered weakly.
He averted his gaze, as if to avoid further conversation.
His eyes landed on a barbarian.
“Behel—Laaaaaaaaaaaaa!!”
Countless monsters swarm from the darkness.
And even more monstrous, swinging his mace while roaring, is a barbarian, more monstrous than the monsters themselves.
Kaboom-!
It’s pointless to count how many explosions we've heard already. Tailon bit his lip.
Click—
The deputy commander made a good decision? You never know what might appear from behind?
He felt disgusted by himself, the one who had feigned ignorance and nodded in agreement.
‘Damn it.’
The truth was simple.
It wasn’t even the deputy commander who told him to retreat. It was that barbarian.
That barbarian, whom he had only considered a mere warrior of the team, the one who was a half-baked mage, the one who hadn't said a word when the clan told him to get lost...
[There could be something behind us as well.]
Without turning around, he said those words, and Tellion couldn't retort.
No, he didn’t.
It was a short time, but he had simply thought it was something no human could do.
Kaboom-!
Every swing of his weapon is instantly met with excruciating pain.
No matter how agile you are, there's no escape.
The problem is that it dulls your body.
Even though you need to swing your weapon nonstop, your hands freeze up and refuse to move.
So pathetic.
“Hey, don’t worry too much. It’s something anyone can do if they can't feel pain.”
Had his expression betrayed him?
The man next to him spoke, as if comforting him.
One of the two remaining warriors who had retreated from the front line along with him.
“They say essences that grant pain resistance are generally poorly rated, but if it can make this kind of tactic possible, perhaps it deserves a reevaluation.”
The man’s comfort didn’t open his mouth.
He had thought the same way at first.
The only way to pour potions like that is to have pain resistance, and to begin with, he and that Barbarian are of different roles.
They both fight at the front as warriors, but…
He doesn’t just endure and buy time; he exploits fleeting opportunities to land a fatal blow to the enemy’s throat.
Kaboom-!
So it’s a natural outcome.
There's no need for self-loathing.
Yes, that’s what he thought.
But…
“Behel—Laaaaaaaaaaaaa!”
The more he looked at that huge back, the more he wondered.
‘How can he not hesitate in that state…?’
His flesh, engulfed in explosions, melts away like water.
The beasts that lunge at him bite into his exposed bones.
Yet, amidst all of this, that Barbarian swings his weapon without the slightest hesitation.
Unlike him, who was frozen in place.
He continues to do what he has to do without stopping.
‘But is it something anyone can do?’
No way.
They say that even with pain resistance, you don’t completely lose your sense of pain...
Even if that weren't the case, it’s true.
“They say barbarians are unmatched in their courage, and it seems that’s true.”
“It’s as if he doesn’t know the meaning of death.”
Potions, priests, and vampire essence don’t make you invincible.
As a famous explorer once said,
There is no one who doesn’t die within the Labyrinth.
The same applies to that Barbarian.
‘Denying it anymore is pointless.’
Ironically, once he accepted it, his heart felt lighter. In a life-or-death situation, doing what you have to do silently.
How many people are unable to do even this simple thing?
What that Barbarian is doing right now is absolutely not something anyone can do.
It's evident from the reactions around him, different from before.
“The deputy commander's foresight is truly extraordinary. I never expected him to be able to handle this mission so well.”
“Does anyone know his name? Someone like him must be well-known…”
“What about the conversation he had with the deputy commander earlier? If someone like him joins the clan, we'll be extremely strong…”
Even without knowing the specifics of his pain resistance, it’s impossible not to notice.
That Barbarian saved them.
“If he weren’t there, I can’t even imagine what situation we would be in.”
“Was it Misha? What exactly is her identity?”
“Oh, I don’t know…”
Someone asked about his half-baked brother, but unfortunately, they couldn’t get a proper answer.
However, he thought to himself, hearing the mage Herrneshion's mumbling next to him.
“If Balcan, the Barbarian Hero, were to return alive, he would probably be just like that…”
There’s no need to be curious about that Barbarian’s name yet.
“It’s over! We’re nearing the end!”
“Speed it up!”
It won't be long before everyone knows.

[Field effect [Gap of Evil] is disappearing.]
***
The moment we emerged from the darkness.
Whoom—!
A roar like a raging storm erupts.
Simultaneously, a crimson ray shoots down from the ceiling towards the center of the darkness.
Kaboom—!!
A scene reminiscent of the end of the world.
Witnessing this, Macgrain muttered,
“It was close.”
“I agree.”
Beyond the darkness that dissipated like mist, nothing remained.
Where the Orc colony once stood, there was nothing but the remnants of a ravaged land.
The heat of battle fades from my mind.
If we had escaped even a little later…
‘[Dark Origin] and all that, I would’ve died right there.’
It’s a bit of a joke to conclude it with ‘it was close.’
In the final stage, my spiritual energy,
or rather, my MP, ran out, and [Gigantification] ended.  The explorers who went the other way must have all died, as clones began to swarm like a tidal wave.
It was nothing short of a miracle that we escaped in time.
Even so, it's not over yet.
‘No, it’s actually time to start praying for real.’
I quickly checked the number of survivors.
There were exactly 30 people.
The explorers who followed us in exchange for equipment perished in droves.
‘In other words, the odds are 1 in 30. No, if you include Misha, it's 1 in 15….'
It’s low, but it’s a probability that's hard to feel relieved about.
I kept my guard up and observed the others, watching for any changes.
And then it happened.
“Bi, Bjorn…?”
Misha's voice came from beside me.
A somewhat flustered tone.
“Uh, uh, my body won’t move…”.
I turned my head to look at Misha, and I saw her stiff and frozen.
[Misha Calstain has been designated as [Bait]]
[Misha Calstain enters an Action Impairment state]
Are you kidding me?
Macgrain made a strange sound, almost like a gasp.
“Amazing. I never thought it would come from your side.”
“Wh, why are you all looking at me like that…?”
There’s no time to explain it all.
Just in case, I asked, 
My eyes fixed on Misha’s brother.
“Do you plan on taking her with you?”
“Th, that…”
“I’m afraid that would be difficult. We’ve reached a point where we can't afford any more sacrifices.”
Macgrain bluntly refuses, speaking for his brother, who is having trouble responding.
But I asked again,
“What about you? No matter what the relationship, she's your sister. Are you going to let her die like this?”
“Bi, Bjorn… I’m okay, so please…”.
Okay, what’s okay?
Your life is on the line.
“So, what’s the answer?”
I pressed again, and he looked at Macgrain before replying briefly.
“For me… this is more important than family.”
Damn it, that’s because he doesn’t think of her as family.
Anyway, he’s an unlikeable bastard to the very end.
“What a waste of time.”
Muttering those words, I picked up Misha, who had turned into a log, and tied her with cloth.
Then I hurriedly checked the time.
[23:45]
We have about 15 minutes until the Labyrinth closes.
Short if you think about it, long if you think about it.
[The Chaos Lord Riachis awakes]
It seems like it’s going to be the longest 15 minutes of my life.
