Chapter 35: The Warrior (3)
My mind is blank, my vision blurry. Pain? Needless to say. It's like my entire body is being ripped apart and soaked in salt water. I want to give up, but...
"Damn it."
I force myself to toss away my weak thoughts. At a crossroads, humans must make a choice. What do we discard, and what do we sacrifice to protect it?
*Thwock!*
Something sharp stabs deeply into my thigh. It's fine. It's not an area that will immediately endanger my life. However, seeing prey that wouldn't die no matter how much it was torn apart, perhaps it ignited my anger.
"Kyaaaack!"
The vampire spawn's movements become even more ferocious. But my task remains the same. I raise the shield, now half its original size from being slashed and torn, to somehow protect my vital points.
*Clang!*
The shield, unable to withstand the attack of a 5th-grade monster, was torn apart, leaving only the handle behind. Without hesitation, I raise my arm to protect my head instead.
At that moment.
*Clang!*
Something, not a claw, hits my head and shatters, showering me with sharp fragments.
"The soul of the Corpse Golem seeps into the character's soul."
The pain instantly dulls.
"Pain resistance +70 increased."
A new vitality takes root in my body reaching its limit.
"Strength +15 increased."
The fog in my vision, as if a mist had settled, clears. The first thing I see is the sharp claw of the vampire beast swinging toward the arm I have raised to shield my head. Upon seeing it, I unconsciously imagine my own arm being completely sliced off, but...
The reality is completely different.
*Slash!*
The claw cuts through the soft flesh with ease. However, that was all that was allowed.
*Crack!*
The claw stops, unable to penetrate further due to the bone. Only then do I realize what this mysterious power is.
"Bone density +55 increased."
"Poison resistance +12 increased."
"Perception -5 decreased."
"Appetite +9 increased."
"Weight +21 increased."
"The passive skill [Acidic Body Fluids] causes the character's blood to absorb acidity..."
A feeling of both relief and sorrow washes over me.
"Did I eat the Corpse Golem's essence...?"
Because of this, I will have to make tremendous adjustments to my training methods. However, looking at the present with shortsightedness, which is something I rarely do...
It's extremely positive. My chances of survival have increased.
*Thud!*
I roll backward and get up. Is it because of the effects of pain resistance? Once the pain issue was somewhat resolved, I was able to move.
"But what about the Guardian's essence? Does it become invalid because I ate the Corpse Golem's essence?"
The thought that suddenly crossed my mind fades away. I can think about that later.
"Kyaaaack!"
As if intrigued by the suddenly revitalized prey, the vampire beast charges with fervor. My body moves to evade, but the subsequent events don't differ much from before. After all, is it possible that eating one 7th-grade essence would allow me to overwhelm a 5th-grade monster?
The flesh shield, who used to lay down and take a beating, can now stand and move.
"That's about the only change."
I chuckle, though it's a self-deprecating assessment.
*Thwock!* *Slash!* *Crack!*
The claw tears through my flesh, ripping through my internal organs.
The potion I had swallowed earlier and stored in my stomach has been fully digested, so the regeneration rate is slow. But it doesn't matter. The mage, who was previously passive, has finally realized his life is in danger and has begun to pour his resources into it.
*Clang!*
A glass bottle flies and shatters, pouring its contents over my body.
"The effect of [Recovery (High)] rapidly regenerates the body."
Is it a high-grade potion? It seems to have better performance than the one the blonde consumed.
*Hiss, hiss, hiss!*
My wounds begin to heal faster than before. I actively charge toward the beast.
So what if I get cut, so what if my muscles tear? It'll heal in seconds anyway.
"Kyaaaack!"
"Waaaaack!!!"
I roar to match the vampire beast, engaging in close combat.
I had no choice. The hammer is far away, the shield is a lump of scrap metal.
"Kya, kyaack?!"
Perhaps the explorer hasn't encountered ground techniques, but as I cling to his back like a cicada and constrict his neck, the beast seems greatly bewildered. Well, is it bewildered or in pain?
"Kyaaaack!"
Smoke billows from the point where our flesh touches.
*Hiss, hiss, hiss!*
Whether it's the smoke from my acidic blood touching the beast or the smoke from my body healing with the potion, it's impossible to tell...
But it doesn't matter.
"It's probably both."
Even in this stalemate, another potion flies in and shatters with a *clang*.
"The effect of [Recovery (High)] rapidly regenerates the body."
So potions and acid are just a hair's breadth apart.
As the potion shatters, the vampire, whose neck is being choked, lets out a greater shriek before easily throwing me off.
I can clearly feel the overwhelming difference in strength. But...
"Damn, it's nothing special, kid."
The path ahead is slowly becoming clear. In this state, the Barbarian immortal mode, I can withstand this bastard for minutes.
I'm certain.
"Bjorn! I'll help!"
Even Einar has rejoined the battle.
"Murad?"
"The baggage carrier is taking care of him!"
Einar's arrival is a further positive development. I take on the main tank role while consuming potions, and Einar swings his greatsword to buy me time whenever it gets dangerous.
The battle becomes smoother.
"Kyaaaack!"
"Einar! Dodge! The crows will be here soon!"
At my call, Einar retreats back dramatically. The beast's body transforms into hundreds of crows and takes flight. But they don't reach us, who have already moved.
"Bjorn is truly amazing! How did you know this would happen?"
Well, before using it, the beast always squinted one eye. It feels less like a racial trait of the vampire and more like a habit unique to this individual.
The end truly seems to be in sight.
"I'm sorry! You all held on well! Hahaha!"
The dwarf, who healed his injuries with a potion, has rejoined the battle. He even brought the baggage carrier.
"I'll lend a hand now."
"We'll support you from the side!"
I naturally continue to perform the main tank role. It's not like they are trying to spare themselves, though. I guess they actually think it's more efficient that way.
"Bjorn, son of the great warrior Jandel! You'll do just fine! Hahaha!"
He means it as a compliment, but...
"He means I'll be rolling around like a dog until the end."
It's not like this is a new concept for me, but...
"Behel-laaaaaaaa!"
With the four of us facing the vampire beast, forming a formation with me at the center, the point I have been desperately waiting for has finally arrived.
"I'm ready."
If "I'm ready" means that he has finished recovering his mana, finished casting the "Black Spot Sphere," and even completed the "Attribute Enhancement"...
That means all preparations are complete. In other words, it's time to end this long, grueling fight and get out of here.
"I can cast the spell anytime."
The moment I hear his confirmation, I shout loudly.
"Murad! Now! Use "Electrical Discharge"!"
An order without any promise or even a single mention. However, the dwarf doesn't hesitate for a moment in carrying out my orders.
*Zzt, zzt, zzt!*
A yellow light flickers on the dwarf's hammer, sparks flying.
"Hiku-road Murad has cast [Electrical]!"
The ability of Ilratreck, a 7th-grade monster. Its effect is to allow a strong electric current to flow through a part of the body. 
The dwarf lowers the hammer with the current flowing through it. It's like he's about to swing an upward strike.
"It's best you all distance yourselves! Hahaha!"
He briefly warns us, then swings his hammer forcefully into the air.
Distancing ourselves from the target, the vampire? Such trivial matters are not an issue.
"Hiku-road Murad has cast [Discharge]!"
"Dungeon and Stone" has one of the rare "Conversion" abilities, "Discharge." Its effect is to allow "energy" obtained through other abilities to be "released" outward.
*Woooosh!*
The electric current that was clinging to the hammer is shot out like a cannonball in the form of a sphere... and it explodes as it is intended.
*Kaboom!*
Despite the sound, the physical power is low. The ground doesn't have a crater, the vampire's limbs aren't ripped off, none of that happens. However...
"Vampire Duke Cambormier has entered a [Stunned] state."
This combo's core is not power in the first place. With the dwarf who stunned the 5th-grade monster in an instant behind me, I signal to the rear.
Using a very analog method.
"Raven——!!!!"
Thankfully, the signal was transmitted properly, and a radiant beam of light instantly condenses from the roof about 200 meters away.
I hurriedly take out the item I hid in my boot. A tiny jewel the size of a fingernail, "The Tear of the Goddess." I have been saving this for this moment, sparing it through countless perils.
*Thud, thud!*
I clutch it tightly and rush forward. Then, I shove it into the beast's maw and...
*Whack!*
I deliver an uppercut with all my might and slam it shut.
*Crack!*
Something shatters, and soon, a brilliant white light bursts from the beast's mouth.
"The Tear of the Goddess has been destroyed."
"The [Grace] descends upon the location of destruction."
"Due to the [Grace], Vampire Duke Cambormier's resistance is temporarily sealed, and he takes significant damage."
Blood pours out of the vampire's mouth like it's going crazy. It looks fine on the outside, but it seems to be broken inside.
I'm truly amazed.
So this one alone doesn't kill him.
"Due to the strong impact, Vampire Duke Cambormier's [Stunned] state is adjusted to [Paralyzed]."
His fingers twitch, as if the stun has ended.
"Is it over yet? It's too late... "
As I turn my head back,
"Arua Raven has cast the 6th-grade offensive spell [Black Spot Sphere]!"
A brilliant sphere, as if swirling blackly, passes right in front of me. Regret hits me too late.
*Kaboom-! *
Damn, I should have run earlier...
***
"The character has been caught in the explosion of [Black Spot Sphere] and entered a [Stunned] state."
"Vampire Duke Cambormier has cast [Pain Sharing]."
"Hiku-road Murad has entered a [Stunned] state."
"Einar Prnellin has entered a [Stunned] state..."
***
*Beep, beep, beep-*
A sharp sound like a terrestrial channel after the national anthem resonates in my head. And through that ringing sound, I hear a conversation.
A conversation with a comedic tone, like a TV comedy duo.
"[What are you doing selling grilled meat at a butcher shop!]"
"[No! It's raw meat!]"
"[No, you grilled it, how can it be raw!]"
"[But...]"
As I listen to their conversation, I open my eyes.
"[He's alive, isn't he?]"
I see the dark, gloomy sky. I can smell the scent of grilled meat through my nose. Is it my body's scent?
"Ugh... "
As I open my mouth, a scraping sound comes from my dry throat. My ears are fine too. I decide to focus on the positive aspects.
"Ugh! Ugh!"
The offensive spell "Black Spot Sphere" combines fire and holy attributes, creating a solar attribute. Naturally, its power is lower than the same level "Fireball."
It's a fortunate aspect for me. Otherwise, I might have really died there.
"But why is it so quiet...?"
I was temporarily stunned by the "Black Spot Sphere." That's clear, but I lack information to understand the current situation. Why haven't I been treated yet, and why can't I hear any sound from my surroundings?
"..."
I prop myself up, pushing off the ground with my sweat-soaked hand. I forcefully focus my eyes and check ahead. 
First, the vampire spawn is visible.
"Damn."
Why is that thing alive? Of course, the bastard is also in a sorry state. Both arms are ripped off, and his upper chest is torn open, revealing bone. He doesn't seem conscious either. But...
"Vampire Duke Cambormier's regeneration has significantly increased due to the [Eternal Life] effect."
He's healing right now. Considering the proportion of lost health, it won't take long for the flesh on his chest to grow back and the ripped off arms to regenerate.
"You, little... "
Looking around, I see several others lying down. The dwarf, Einar, the baggage carrier. Somehow, I feel like the mage on the roof is in the same situation...
It's confusing.
What the hell is going on?
I captured them all, so why are they all unconscious? What happened while I was out? It doesn't seem like much time has passed...
Many questions arise, but...
I decide to ignore them all and take a step forward with my barely moving legs.
*Thud.*
The situation still doesn't make sense. But one thing is abundantly clear. What do I need to do now?
*Thud.*
Vampire Duke Cambormier.
I have to take him out before he regains consciousness. There's no other solution. Even if the mage is rich, his potions are not infinite. In essence, it's safe to assume we can't rely on potions to hold out like before.
*Thud.*
So I walk, even as my body stumbles. Pain that pierces even pain resistance? I ignore it as if it's not there and stretch my steak-smelling leg forward.
*Thud.*
I think of pain as a signal to live. At least, that's what I think now. I haven't always thought that way, but for now, that's the case.
So I keep walking.
*Thud.*
As I get closer, I smell the scent of grilled meat from the vampire spawn too. I collapse on top of him, as if my knees have given way.
"Damn, you, little..."
The wound on his chest, where his bone was visible, has already started to heal significantly while I was walking. I can't help but curse.
*Thwack!*
I punch him in the chest. The vampire's weakness is the heart. Even if their brain is shattered, they can come back to life as long as their heart is intact.
"Ah, this bastard's arms were ripped off because of that. He blocked the 'Black Spot Sphere' with his arms?"
The situation I didn't see unfolds in my mind, but as usual, I simply let it go.
*Whack!*
I punch him again. I feel the lack of equipment more than ever. But if you don't have teeth, you have to chew with your gums.
*Whack!*
I don't even know where the mace is, and the shield is a piece of scrap metal, discarded around me. Of course, Einar's greatsword and the dwarf's battle hammer are lying on the ground...
"I didn't think about picking them up."
I didn't have the strength to do that anyway.
As I continue to punch, the seams of my crumpled, hole-ridden half armor tear apart and fall to the ground.
"My 360,000 stones..."
Looking at the half armor, stained with acidic blood and corroded everywhere, it seems like it won't be easy to repair. It's a different part that really grinds my gears, though.
"Damn."
This is like pouring water into a bottomless pit. It's not changing no matter how much I hit it. Why are his ribs so sturdy? I thought if I kept hitting them, they would break and pierce his heart.
"Okay, I'll give up on this plan."
I always like to have Plan B. Because Plan A has almost never been successful.
Maybe it's because I'm unlucky, but whatever I do, something bad always happens at the end.
"Never tried this before..."
...Is this how it's done? Erwen said that it's important to visualize clearly.
"Flesh Explosion."
Hmm, it actually works.
*Boom!*
My hand on his chest explodes. The explosive force is not great, but the acidic substance mixed with flesh and blood creates a dent in his chest.
Even that quickly regenerates, but...
"I never expected it to work with one try anyway."
I continue to cast [Flesh Explosion]. After about ten times...
*Boom! Boom! Boom!*
My left hand is completely wrecked. Perhaps because of the increased bone density, the bones are intact, only the flesh is gone, making me look like a skeleton.
Anyway, I can't use my left hand anymore.
"Then it's time for my right hand."
The thought crosses my mind that I'm not in my right mind, but I continue to silently chant the spell.
I put my right hand on his chest.
"Flesh Explosion, Flesh Explosion, Flesh Explosion..."
I keep exploding it. I ignore the pain, which surpasses even mental fortitude.
I feel like I'm going to die, but I'm not doing this to die.
I'm going to survive.
*Boom!*
After about eight times, my body sways. It feels like a few more times will do it, but...
"Warning: The character's vitality is below 1%. The character will die if not treated promptly."
I instinctively feel it. I've reached a realm where mental fortitude can no longer hold out.
I should stop now. If not, I might be able to kill the vampire spawn, but I'll die too. That's the feeling I have, but reason judges:
"It's the same whether I stop or not..."
I can't stop. I'll sacrifice myself for my comrades. That's absolutely not the reason.
*Boom!*
Maybe to someone, I look like a crazy bastard, but...
In that fleeting moment, I'm certain. This is definitely the only path with even a sliver of chance of survival.
*Boom!*
The moment I detonate the flesh again...
"Warning: The character's vitality has reached 0%."
I feel something changing. It feels like something is escaping from my entire body, yet strangely, my body feels lighter. It's hard to explain.
Soon, I realize.
"Initiating countdown."
Ah, this is it. The one I called the "Afterglow."
"Consuming 3 mental strength per second. (43/46)"
"Consuming 3 mental strength per second. (40/46)"
"Consuming 3 mental strength per second. (37/46)"
With a feeling as if the grim reaper is right behind me, I detonate the flesh again.
*Boom!*
The beast's chest caved in once more. Is this a Barbarian's combat instinct? Somehow, it feels clearer than ever.
"One more."
One more time. That's all. So...
"Flesh Explosion."
With my right arm, which has almost no flesh left, I press my chest against the beast's and detonate it once more. 
At the same time.
"Vampire Duke Cambormier has been defeated. EXP +5."
The vampire spawn's body turns into particles of light. Yes, you die too.
"Bonus for defeating a high-grade variant. EXP +1"
"Bonus for defeating a Guardian. EXP +3"
My chest swells. Not a psychological description, but literally.
I know exactly what my current situation is because I've experienced it before.
"The character's level has increased."
"Soul Power +10 increased."
"Maximum absorbable essence +1 increased."
My level has increased. I'm not exactly happy. It was about time, and...
"Dungeon and Stone" is not a game where your HP increases just because you level up.
"Consuming 3 mental strength per second. (16/46)"
How many seconds do I have left? At most, five seconds.
"...Is it finally down to luck in the end?"
No matter how many times I think about it, it's a situation I can't accept. But I decide not to regret it.
"In-game, the probability of a Guardian spitting out essence from a rift is approximately 33%."
33%. It's too low a chance to risk my life. But it's also incomparably higher than 0%.
"It's not worth not doing it again, even if I think about it."
As if to shake off my regrets, I smirk. 
I struggled to the very end. So now I just have to wait for the results.
"Consuming 3 mental strength per second. (13/46)"
"Consuming 3 mental strength per second. (10/46)"
"Consuming 3 mental strength per second..."
One second, two seconds, three seconds. Time passes, and my eyes gradually close.
"Did I fail...?"
It's not a failure due to my mistake. It's simply that luck wasn't on my side.
"Maybe it's the best ending for me."
I close my eyes, surrendering to the flow. I hope that when I open them again, I'll be back as Lee Hansoo, a 29-year-old office worker.
"Kick."
Well, it's not going to happen.
