Chapter 96: Barbarian Trophy (3)
"Ha ha! You're as fiery as a Barbarian!" The Baron laughed loudly at my decision.
It was the kind of laugh only someone who knew nothing about Barbarians could produce. Not that Barbarians are beings devoid of fear. As Ainarr had said in the past:
"[We were born to be warriors. If we can't fight, we die.]"
They merely march forward with their fears. It's what they have to do. My choice this time was no different.
Perhaps, after a period of peace, this could be the time for a major catastrophe? 
"It would be a lie to say I'm not anxious…."
But what can I do about it? If I choose to evade the future, which hasn't even been decided yet, my end will be nothing but ruin. With that kind of mentality, how would I ever enter the Labyrinth, or make rational decisions? If I had been like that, I wouldn't even be alive today.
"I spoke to the Count. He was very pleased." 
The Baron returned soon after I sat down and composed my thoughts. It seemed my choice pleased him greatly. 
"Ah, but is this necklace truly that important to you?"
He asked, seemingly certain that the prize had influenced my decision. I didn't deny it. 
"Numbers items are expensive, aren't they." 
"Hmm… if you say so, then it must be true."
Judging by his expression, he suspected I had another reason, but he didn't probe deeper. He simply asked, "How strong are you?"
"...?"
"From your ambition, it seems you're actually thinking about winning. Are you that confident?"
I chuckled. How strong I am?  There were too many monsters in this world to answer that confidently. But…
"To be honest, I don't even hope for victory. But if you lose too easily, it will affect my reputation—"
He added, "Apprentice Knight."  In other words, a level 3 explorer. That changes things.
"Oh, don't worry about that."  I interrupted the Baron's words. I hadn't been worried about this part from the beginning. "Ten seconds is enough."
"Enough? Ten seconds?"  The Baron tilted his head, confused.
I affirmed, "I can smash the head of any average person before that."
This was the truth, without any exaggeration or embellishment. But did that truth reach him?
"H-hick!"
The butler, who had happened to catch my eye, choked on his breath.

Knight. 
As they were in medieval times, these individuals were the epitome of physical strength, here as well.  Of course, assuming they have shed the 'apprentice' title.
'What kind of knight can't even use Aura?'
A knight's strength lies in Aura. 90% ignore defense, 90% ignore magic resistance. It's basically a cheat code that allows them to cut through anything, combined with systematically developed practical swordsmanship.  That alone makes them monstrous, but...
'They level up with potions, and eat high-grade Essences with their abundant wealth? No wonder the power doesn't leave human hands.'
In a world teeming with demi-humans and magic, Knights were the spear and shield that protected the privileged. 
Even considering the maximum level you can reach with potions is 5, a proper knight could cut down several high-level explorers alone. They are that specialized in one-on-one combat. But...
'An apprentice is at most level 3. And the best Essence they can get is probably grade 7.'
This is assuming the maximum. A noble wouldn't invest that much in someone who can't even use Aura yet. 
'Honestly, the tournament isn't a problem...'.
It's what comes after that I'm concerned about. The Count's excessive interest too. If some barbarian suddenly wins here, the privileged class might look at me with disdain. But now that I've made my decision, regrets are a luxury I can't afford.
'Focus on this right now.'
I decided to worry about the future after winning. While I was spending some quiet time in a corner, courtesy of the Baron,  three figures clad in knight's armor approached me.
"You were quite cocky just now, weren't you?"
I recognized them all.  We might have only had a fleeting encounter, but I wouldn't forget their faces after seeing them today.
"Ten seconds is enough? Has that stupid Barbarian gotten so absorbed in his clown act that he forgot his place?"
This one. He was the one who had mocked me as a "little jester" while entertaining nobles at the outdoor banquet. His tiny, rodent-like front teeth were memorable. As I watched him, the one next to him picked up the conversation as if passing a baton.
"Barbarian, you should implore your ancestral gods to spare you from meeting me. I will sever your head in an instant. It won't take even ten seconds, of course."
I don't know his name because he didn't reveal it. This one was the one who fawned over the Count and said things like "a warrior's pride is a thing of the past." He was a complete idiot. Judging by his tone, he seems to have a vanity complex, too...
"If I meet you—"
Just as the baton was about to be passed to the next player, I quickly got up and interrupted. I prefer to avoid making enemies, but...
"Are you three mentally deficient?" 
I tried to put it delicately. If I had asked, "Are you idiots?" I might have been accused of insulting a noble.
"What, what?"
"You're crowding around me like cowards, thinking you'll scare me? Even a three-year-old warrior from my tribe wouldn't do something like this!"
"...Cowards? How dare you insult us—"
"If not that, then what? Did the Baron's absence suddenly give you courage you didn't have before? What an amazing sense of honor you have!"
"That, that's..."
They wouldn't dare approach me when the Baron was around. I pointed this out, and the three knights blinked like goldfish.  But as I have no preconceptions about Barbarians, I didn't think they were speechless. They were just startled, I suppose. They couldn't have expected me to call out their behavior so loudly.
"That's why I asked!  Knights are supposed to have pride, aren't they? But to use 'numerical superiority' against a 'fellow participant' in such a childish manner? You must have a mental problem!"
I shouted, accurately exposing their actions.
"Enough! Will you shut your mouth!"
The face of the three knights, whom I've dubbed "Three Stooges," turned desperate. Naturally. If they kept going, they'd be the ones labeled as "mentally deficient" by a Barbarian. Did they think that continuing the conversation would only cause more commotion?
"...We'll see about that!"
The Three Stooges left, suppressing their anger. The cliche lines they left behind were cringeworthy, even for a native. Their hearts were in the right place, so I decided to give them a reply: 
"Anyway, don't worry too much! I'll be sure to fix whatever problem you have in your heads if we meet again!"
Did my heartfelt message reach them? I couldn't tell, only seeing their backs as they quickly walked away.
***
Despite the short-lived commotion, the banquet, full of various attractions, was reaching its climax. This meant the moment for the tournament prepared by the Count had arrived.
"The Barbarian we saw this afternoon is supposed to be competing. Don't you find it rather exciting?"
"Hmm, I don't know. Just an explorer, isn't he?  He's gained some fame recently, but I heard he's only been an explorer for less than a year."
The venue was the outdoor banquet area, on a patch of grass.  The area was already packed with people, and some nobles had even set up chairs on the second-floor terrace of the mansion to get a better view.
As I sat quietly in the prepared tent, the Baron approached, acting like a coach of sorts.
"Aren't you nervous?" 
"No." 
"Goodness, a heart of steel indeed.  I'm excited myself,  but you're so calm."
I don't know what praise was attached to that, but it was true that he was excited. He promised me bonuses I hadn't even asked for.
"If you win, I'll give you an extra million stones. So go ahead, give it your all. My reputation rests on you."
"I'll do my best!"
Perhaps it was because of the sudden financial therapy?  I felt my motivation rising.
"The Serpia Baron's Saboan and the Henslvenia Viscount's Arpeon, please take your places!"
A little while later, the first match began. The two knights, having sworn the Oath of Combat on stage, swung their swords with panache, earning cheers from the crowd.
'This really is a barbaric world.'
I had snuck out of the tent to watch the match, and a strange feeling came over me. It was like watching the Roman Colosseum. And the truth was, it wasn't that different. There was a rule that they should try not to kill their opponents, but...
'On the other hand, that implies it's okay to kill them.'
It's not strange, really. They are fighting with real swords, so it's more surprising if there are no casualties. 
'Even though it's the first match, the atmosphere is overheated.  These two are fighting with blood.'
Despite the first match, two knights continued their bloody duel in the midst of the heated energy. It was as intense as it was dramatic when the winner and loser were decided.
"The victor is the Henslvenia Viscount's Arpeon!"
The outcome was decided when the knight's sword-wielding hand was severed.  Of course, the injured knight's arm was reattached by a priest, but the blood that had sprayed out like a fountain remained as a vivid decoration on the stage.  
However...
"Woooooo!"
Hearing the crowd's enthusiastic cheers, I suddenly realized. 
This is a different world. And I've already become a part of it.
"Hu hu, you're excited to see blood, aren't you?" 
Well, I don't know about that. What I do know is that I'm up next.
"The Hessen Baron's Silvennia and the Martoang Baron's... Bjorn Yandel, please take your places!"
Following the announcer's instructions, I walked towards the stage, pushing through the crowd. Just then, a knight appeared from the opposite side.
What a coincidence. I didn't know his name, so I couldn't tell from the match schedule.
"Hu hu, you look surprised, don't you?"
I nodded slightly in acknowledgment.  One of the Three Stooges was my opponent in the first match? Amazing. 
'And the most annoying one, at that.' 
Unconsciously, the corners of my lips turned up. I didn't hear his resolve because I cut him off, but... how could I forget him?
[Apparently, the name comes from the fact that the place is small?]
He was the one who spread that nonsensical rumor. I'm not one to say this, but... how dare a human...
***
Before the duel began, he recited the Oath of Combat. A typical oath swearing by the knight's honor to engage in the duel seriously, using no unfair or foul means. It was my turn next.
"Behel—raaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!"
A barbaric cry, dropping all the elaborate phrases. 
The crowd's enthusiasm surged even higher.
"Woooooooo!"
As if annoyed by receiving more attention than him, Silvennia, or whatever his name was, muttered, "Crude and uncouth."
What?  Did you expect a Barbarian to be refined?
Following the announcer's lead, we approached each other, weapons clashing. He held a long sword, and I held a giant double-bladed battleaxe, not the mace I'd left at the Baron's mansion.
'…I'm not used to these blades.'
It's a shame, but the way you use them isn't that different. I just swing it as usual. The results will be similar.  Whether I'm cut or sliced apart is the only difference.
"Ha!"
As soon as the duel began, Silvennia kicked off the ground and charged at me. It seemed he wanted to return the "ten-second" favor I had mentioned.
'Interesting.'
I decided to step back and observe. This was my first time encountering a knight's swordsmanship, so I was curious.  Plus...
*Whoosh-*
Even with the "apprentice" tag, this guy's swordsmanship is quite sharp.
"Die!"
What is this, a move from a martial arts novel? His swordsmanship was delivered in a three-pronged attack, creating illusions. I momentarily wondered which one was real, but that moment was fleeting.
If you don't know which one is real, just cut them all down.
'I've become a Barbarian myself.'
I turned the blade of the axe sideways and swung as wide as I could. It was enough.
Clang!
The force of the swing knocked the sword's trajectory off course. Silvennia lost his balance. 
But he didn't drop his sword. He didn't seem flustered either.  He twisted his body, connecting the move like a combo, swinging the sword at my neck.
'He's not someone to underestimate.'
His swordsmanship was graceful like a dragon's dance, moving in a gentle curve from the bottom. 
Despite his personality, I had to acknowledge him.  What kind of swordsmanship was passed down through generations?
'His martial skills are several levels above mine.'
If we were on equal footing, I wouldn't be able to win. 
But that wasn't a concern.
"Behel—raaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!"
Because this guy and I aren't on equal footing.
"The character has used [Frenzied Instinct]."
"The character's Threat level temporarily increases threefold, increasing their physical stats proportionally."
There was still plenty of time before ten seconds passed.
