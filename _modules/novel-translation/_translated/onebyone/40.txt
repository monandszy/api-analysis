Chapter 40: Guild (5)
“Wh, what are you saying, mage? Even if you know her, if you protect her like this…”
The investigator stammered, his voice more akin to a desire to deny the truth than disbelief.
But her reaction was simply curt.
“Are you saying I'm lying?”
“N, no, I mean, it’s not like that…”
“Then what exactly is it?  You're a lowly investigator with minimal authority, probing adventurers, now even a mage is beneath you?”
Mages in the Magic Tower were practically junior nobles. Though there were several schools, they were essentially a tightly-knit entity, fiercely protective of their rights. 
From any angle, the fact that a mere investigator dared to question the mage's words was a problem.
The branch manager intervened cautiously, unable to watch any longer.
“Why don’t we stop here? As the mage understands, it would be a baseless claim if one isn't aware of the situation.”
She nodded in agreement.
“Certainly, there’s no precedent of a vampire being spotted in the first-floor rift.”
Unlike when dealing with the investigator, a courteous smile played on her lips. 
Though it only lasted for a fleeting moment.
“I appreciate you saying that, b-”
“But there’s still so much unknown about the labyrinth since its creation. Baseless claim? Is that something an adventurer guild, especially a branch manager, should be saying?”
Scathing criticism, delivered with calculated pauses. 
Was she really a mage?
The position of branch manager in the guild seemed irrelevant to her.
“….”
The branch manager, having inadvertently intervened, was speechless as he shut his mouth tight. 
Knock, knock.
The sound of a knock echoed.
This wasn’t a knock for permission. 
The door burst open before anyone could authorize entry.
“Are you the Barbarian?”
“Who is this?”
“I’m Nile Urban.”
Two men had entered the room.
A middle-aged man with a striking, neat tuxedo and a younger man who seemed to be his escort.
“Th, the regional leader!”
“Father…?”
Julian, held hostage, and the branch manager both gaped in astonishment. 
I, too, tightened my relaxed muscles again.
‘…So, the regional leader has finally arrived.’
The guild's operational system was simple. Each of the hundreds of branches in the city had a branch manager, and these were overseen by thirteen regional leaders. 
The only rank above them was the ‘Guild Master.’ So, the thirteen regional leaders could be considered the guild's second-in-command.
As a rank-9 adventurer, seeing their faces even from afar was an impossible feat.
But even for such individuals, the world didn't always work according to their whims.
“You’ve stirred up some ridiculous business, haven’t you?”
Feeling the regional leader’s gaze filled with displeasure, I let out a wry smile.
Ridiculous business, huh…
“Well, from your perspective, it probably is.”
If that jerk, Hearts Young, hadn’t lied under oath.
Even if he had, if the investigator hadn't been greedy and dealt with matters according to proper procedures.
No, if the adventurer guild had been a fair and just organization that managed its employees well from the start…
Perhaps I wouldn't have had to go through all this hell.
But they didn’t do any of that.
“It was probably a minor matter for you.”
But not for me. 
For me, it was a matter of life and death.
“So you did this crazy thing because of that?”
“Crazy thing?”
I asked back.
“Is it crazy to fight for your life?”
“Well, surely there were other options. You’ve blown things out of proportion.”
Other options, my foot.
Until I broke through the iron bars and arrived here, that branch manager didn’t even know I existed in his branch.
And the regional leader, who had the power to amend the guild’s internal rules to allow investigations based on mere suspicion of rank-9 adventurers, was no different. 
“If you had done your jobs right, none of this would have happened.”
I muttered coldly, laced with sarcasm. 
“You! What kind of insolence is that before the regional leader!”
The branch manager butted into the conversation.
The investigator and the regional leader’s escort both looked at me like I was some kind of insane madman.
Well, they wouldn’t consider me any different from a freak. 
A stubborn fool who defied logic.
The regional leader sighed and shifted his gaze.
“What is your name, mage?”
“I’m Aruwa Raven.”
“I see, Raven. Perhaps, if I paid you enough, you’d be willing to sell me that crystal ball?”
A proposition that needed no further examination. 
I never expected him to be this blatant about it.
My heart skipped a beat, but…
“I decline your offer.”
“Pity.”
“I wouldn’t imagine you’d try to forcibly take it, would you?”
“Ha! Of course not. Your school master wouldn’t let it slide.”
The regional leader laughed cheerfully.
“Why are you all so stiff? That was all a joke. How could I possibly do that when people are gathered outside, eagerly awaiting the results?”
Joke my ass.
Cold sweat trickled down my spine.
“….”
That’s why I wanted to bring a priest with me in the first place.
‘Video memory’ magic, whatever. Mages were beings who could be bought off for their personal gain.
If she and I were complete strangers, if she had been bought off by the regional leader…
‘The crowd outside, whatever. I’d be dead right here.’
Anyway, the outcome wasn't bad.
She kept her word, and the regional leader couldn’t bury the matter with his authority.
In other words, I just needed to prove my innocence now. 
No matter what, the end was nearing.
“Enough of this, let’s wrap this up.”
I walked towards the wardrobe and woke Hearts Young, who was sleeping inside.
“Wh, what is this? Why am I here…”
I heard someone swallow hard nearby.
Well, they had reason to.
The moment it was proven that this guy lied under oath. 
It would be a truly ridiculous situation from their perspective.
***
“This man is lying.”
As Raven uttered these words, a heavy silence enveloped the room.
“So, what will you do now, regional leader?”
“Bjorn Yandel, was it? You’re innocent.”
As I watched the regional leader’s forced smile, I replied.
“I can’t thank you for that.”
Even the branch manager, who had been listening from the side, didn't dare add a single word to my tone. 
He just trembled, keeping an eye on the regional leader.
“So, what do you want us to do?”
“Isn't it obvious? I demand punishment and compensation.”
“Very well.”
The regional leader nodded silently, as if tapping calculations on an imaginary calculator, before finally speaking.
“First, the investigator who handled your case will be dismissed.”
“Th, regional leader! I, I swear on the heavens, I did nothing but investigate according to regulations…!”
“Are you trying to shift your incompetence onto the guild? Every verdict you have passed will be meticulously reinvestigated. And if any wrongdoing is found in the process, you will face the same punishment.”
“B, but how can you!”
The investigator, so arrogant just a moment ago, was now pale and kneeling.
Seeing his fear, it seemed he hadn’t led a clean and honest life all this time. 
Well, looking back at his actions, it wasn’t surprising at all.
“Pl, please spare me! I beg you…!”
‘He should be begging on this side, not that side.’
The thought crossed my mind, but I didn't say it out loud. If he had been a good guy, he wouldn't have gotten to this point in the first place.
That’s how the world works. 
No one ever regrets hitting someone.
Regrets only come when you receive the consequences.
“What about this one then?”
The other contributor to this case. 
As I looked at Hearts Young, the regional leader responded without hesitation.
“This man, in order to conceal his own crimes, gave false testimony, causing severe confusion in the investigation. He will be dealt with accordingly.”
The regional leader’s words carried weight.
Although he hadn't even been tried, let alone investigated yet, it was practically a death sentence.
“N, no….”
Hearts Young fainted, eyes rolling back, but no one paid attention.
“If possible, I’d like the clan he belongs to investigated as well.”
“The 수정연합? They’ve been causing a stir with their shenanigans.  I agree, I’ll do as you say.”
The regional leader readily agreed to every demand I made.
He seemed to be a rather clever man. 
He clearly understood that he had no choice but to give in to my demands.
“So, is the punishment satisfactory?”
“Well…,” 
I trailed off, staring at one point. The branch manager, caught by my gaze, hastily averted his eyes.
I let out a wry smile and nodded.
“It would be greedy to ask for more.”
“I’m grateful for your understanding of the situation.”
Don’t mention it.
I was planning on getting something else in return.
“Now, with the punishment settled, we need to discuss compensation for the wrongs we’ve committed against you. Do you have any requests?”
“Let’s hear it.”
“We will first raise your rank to rank-7.”
“Rank elevation…,” 
Not bad.
Becoming a rank-7 adventurer meant fewer crowds at the exchange office and various other benefits. 
If I hadn’t been a rank-9, the investigator wouldn’t have been so arrogant.
“Th, regional leader!  To elevate an adventurer who’s been here for only two months to rank-7 in one go!”
The branch manager made a comment, worried about the fairness issue that might arise later, but the regional leader firmly shook his head.
“We’re apologizing now. So, don’t raise any objections on this matter.”
“…Understood.”
The regional leader acted as if he was genuinely apologizing, like a politician. 
Especially in the lack of substance.
“Hold on a second. Something seems off about this.”
Just as I was about to speak, Raven intervened, beating me to it. 
Tension was palpable as everyone wondered what she was going to say… 
But Raven herself didn’t seem to care.
“How can a rank elevation be compensation? Elevating a capable adventurer is simply the guild’s duty, isn’t it?”
“But, as you just heard, he’s—”
“He doesn’t have much experience, you say? So what?”
“It’s unprecedented, that’s why—”
“It’s obviously unprecedented.”
Raven interrupted the regional leader several times, firing off her words like a machine gun.
“There’s no adventurer who has returned from consuming the essence of a rank-5 monster, a vampire, especially one that’s the guardian of the rift, in just two months.”
“…So, what are you trying to say, Raven?”
“I don’t know. It just felt a little tacky to boast about doing something you should have done in the first place.”
She then gave me a sly smile.
As I wasn’t so oblivious as to miss out on a free meal, I joined in.
“So, maybe a real reward is in order.”
“…What do you want?”
Well, after going through all this trouble, I needed to get something back.
Just as I was wondering what to demand, Raven spoke up, as if waiting for this moment.
“Of course it’s money. What else can the adventurer guild give? “
There were other things they could offer, if you looked hard enough. 
Free permanent binding magic, being allowed to post personal notices on the guild's bulletin board, and so on.
‘In the end, it all boils down to money.’
As I nodded in agreement, the regional leader sighed and raised the white flag. 
“How much will it take?”
It was basically a blank check, I just needed to fill in the amount.
Feeling an odd sense of trust in her since a while ago, I looked at her. 
It was my way of saying I would trust her rational judgment.
Fortunately, she seemed to get the message, and with a hint of satisfaction on her face, she opened her mouth.
“Considering you almost killed a promising adventurer by mistake…,”
She trailed off and blurted out.
“You should at least give him 5 million stones, wouldn’t you?”
The regional leader nodded without a word.
“…Fine, I’ll pay.”
It wasn’t surprising.
5 million stones was far beyond my expected maximum, but…
‘That was when I was going to ask.’
Perhaps I wouldn’t have gotten this smooth of a deal without Raven.
Was this the power of status?
As I inwardly marveled at the sheer might of it all, I wondered how I could repay her for her help today.
But then Raven spoke again.
“Oh, and my fee is separate, 1 million stones.”
“Fee? What do you mean? If it’s a support fee, it’s a predetermined amount agreed upon by the Magic Tower—”
“That includes the cost of this crystal ball, recording the joke the regional leader made earlier. Even if you called it a joke… there are quite a few people who might be willing to pay a hefty price for this, wouldn't you say?”
“…Hahaha, you’re really a jokester, young lady.”
“I’m not joking.”
When she turned serious, the regional leader’s face went from stiff to completely sour.
But his hesitation didn’t last long.
“…Very well…,”
He finally nodded.
In a way, it meant he lost 1 million stones because of a single slip of the tongue earlier.
‘…No need to give her a separate fee then.’
These mages, they were something else.
Gazing at her as she quickly secured her own share, I was struck with awe. 
Then her voice echoed in my mind.
[Thanks to you, I’ll be able to pocket some extra spending money.]
Hearing her voice, I thought for the first time in a long time:
I should make an effort to be friends with her in the future.
