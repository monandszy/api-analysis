Chapter 4 Tutorial (3)
I'm an expert when it comes to [Dungeon & Stone].
I can rattle off where any monster will appear, what their habits are, their weaknesses, without even thinking about it.
Based on this, I made my final decision.
The barbarian's body combined with my knowledge would be enough to survive the labyrinth.
At least, I sincerely believed that at the time.
"Ugh..."
The moment I stepped into the labyrinth, darkness enveloped me.
Not metaphorically, but literally; I couldn't see anything. I wouldn't even notice if someone blindfolded me right now.
It wouldn't make much difference anyway.
"Damn it."
It felt like I'd been hit hard in the back of the head.
The barbarians were all just carrying a single weapon, so I hadn't even doubted this part.
The first floor shouldn't need torches.
The crystals embedded in the walls act as light sources.
Of course, there are dark areas on the first floor, but except for the outermost area connected to the second floor, they're just a small part—
'Wait, could I have fallen into that area?'
I quickly formed a hypothesis.
The starting position in the labyrinth is random.
Of course, it's called random, but they wouldn't just throw me into a place like this. Even if I started in the outer area, there would always be a glowing crystal nearby.
However, this isn't the game world I've only seen on a monitor.
What if those things were all just a kind of convenience provided by the developer to the players?
What if dark areas are actually used as starting points in a shitty scenario?
Then, my current situation could be explained.
No, it has to be that way.
If the entire first floor was like this, I wouldn't be able to survive a single day.
"Whew..."
Still, after calmly sorting it out, I calmed down a bit.
Fortunately, my eyes adapted to the darkness, and it was much better than before. Although, I could only barely see outlines.
This isn't a desperate situation where I'd bite my tongue and die.
Let's just go through the things I need to check first.
Now, I'm finally alone.
"Status window, equipment window, character information, status, inventory. Check log…  oh, hell."
It doesn't work, does it?
Well, I didn't expect it anyway.
"Let's go."
With a shield in one hand and the wall in the other, I moved forward.
The speed was slightly faster than crawling.
Or is it?
Maybe crawling is faster, but I can't increase the speed.
It's too dangerous…
"AAAAAH!"
A sharp pain exploded from my ankle.
The pain I had never felt before drove my nerves wild. But even then, I immediately assessed the situation.
What went wrong?
Even without a battle log, the answer came quickly.
[Character stepped on Goblin Trap]
Damn it, I stepped on a trap.
***
What was the wrong move?
It just spills out without any thought.
The shield gave me a sense of psychological security.
But it blocked a significant portion of my vision in return.
If I had just tied the shield to my belt and focused on looking around, I might have spotted the trap.
What good is a shield when I can't see anyway?
I should have prioritized practicality over mental security.
Damn it.
"Ugh…  ah…."
My head goes blank.
I want to scream right now.
But I desperately hold it in.
Unless screaming improves the situation, it's pointless.
It will only make things worse, and I know it for sure.
Thump-thump-thump-thump-thump.
My heart races like it's broken.
"Whew, whew, whew..."
I press my lips together and force myself to breathe evenly.
What I need to think about now isn't how much I'm hurting or struggling.
There's only one monster that uses traps on the first floor.
Goblins.
And they're definitely nearby.
"..."
I instinctively raise my shield to cover my head.
Then, I hold my breath completely and focus on my hearing.
I don't hear anything right now. It's as silent as if time has stopped.
…Maybe they're not here?
I don't know.
Maybe that's possible. Maybe they just happened to be away for a while. Goblins poop too.
'Damn, why do I think that? I don't even believe it.'
I gently folded up the hope that was creeping out and threw it away in my head.
There were two reasons.
One, being positive and being optimistic are different.
Two, what I need now is negative thinking.
"..."
If I can't be sure, then let's assume the worst.
The goblins heard my scream.
They're hiding in the darkness, waiting for me to weaken.
That's why I can't hear anything.
It was like that in the game too.
If there's a trap, there's always a goblin nearby.
"Whew..."
I slowly exhale the breath I've been holding.
Whatever the cause, this is a quiet environment, so as long as I don't let my guard down, I should be able to notice them approaching.
Let's do what I have to do first.
“…  huff!"
I lowered my posture, pried open the trap with both hands, and pulled my foot out. Then, I ripped off the bottom of my pants and, taking off my shoes, applied strong pressure to the wound.
I decided to throw away the ruined shoes.
It's not even really a shoe anymore.
What I was wearing was closer to sandals.
Damn barbarian bastards.
If they had at least sent me off with leather boots, I wouldn't be half-crippled from one trap…
'Damn it, what am I thinking?'
My head grows cold as I discover my own irrationality.
Stop being pathetic.
No matter how much I curse them, the situation won't change.
It's ultimately my fault for not properly checking the ground.
So, stop whining and check my condition.
'Phew, this is really bad.'
I can't feel anything in my right foot already.
I can feel the heat, but even that's gradually becoming numb.
"I know you're hiding, so come out."
I quietly mumbled.
Still, I didn't feel any movement in the darkness.
So, I slowly moved forward.
Thump. Thump.
One leg is broken, but the pain isn't that bad. It must be the paralysis poison…
I don't know if I should be happy about it.
If the effect wears off, that's good.
Being able to feel the pain is also a sign that my nerve cells are still alive.
'No, but why am I so positive about this?'
Well, I don't want to think about it.
I don't have the mental capacity for it.
“… Your mother's a goblin."
Words spill out of my brain without a filter.
Maybe it's because I lost so much blood?
My brain feels pickled in alcohol.
"Your father's a goblin too."
Of course, even as I spit out whatever comes to mind, my feet don't stop.
"So you're a goblin too."
That's when I heard the sound for the first time.
It was definitely a small sound, but it was very loud to my focused ears.
Click-
Finally, the creature revealed its presence.
"Why can't even you resist insults about your parents?"
Of course, I know that's not the reason.
It wasn't even an insult in the first place…
The sound came from behind.
This means, as I moved further away, it couldn't help but move.
I increased my speed even more.
The goblin's footsteps also quickened.
Click- Click- Click- Click-
The goblin's footsteps, now clearer, were peculiar.
It made a sound like something sticky was sticking to and coming off a smooth surface with each step.
Despite knowing the setting, which stated that it was less than a meter tall, I felt an overwhelming pressure, as if a giant monster was chasing me.
To shake off the fear, I kept talking to it.
I'm a barbarian.
If I can lure it into close combat, there's no way I'll lose to a goblin.
"Don't just follow me, come on in, you weakling."
For that reason, I continued to provoke it, but it just kept following me, maintaining a certain distance.
Now, it didn't even seem to be trying to hide anymore.
"Grrk, grrk…!"
It's a howl-like sound, but I somehow felt it.
"Grrrk! Grrk!"
The goblin is giggling right now. It's truly happy to see its prey dying and bleeding. It's hoping I'll be scared by that sound.
…Smart little thing.
Okay, change of plans.
I stopped walking and fell to the ground, stumbling.
Thud!
My forehead hitting the rock felt like it would crack, but I didn't make a sound.
From now on, it's a test of patience.
If it thinks I'm down and approaches first, I win.
If I actually collapse before that, I lose.
"Grrk?"
I decided to believe in the toughness of this body, which walked about 300 meters with a broken leg.
Click-
The goblin's footsteps slowly approached.
It was so slow that I wanted to yawn.
Even though it thought its prey was down, it was still suspicious.
'Damn, are goblins this cautious?'
I can't help but curse.
In the game, goblins were the weakest trash mobs. They used poison and traps, but otherwise, their combat abilities were pathetic.
But how was the real one?
Click-
It stopped moving somewhere between 5 and 10 meters away.
Why?
I was wondering about the reason when I felt a dull impact on my shoulder.
Thud.  Roll, roll, roll.
What? Is this little bastard throwing rocks at me?
“…  Will it keep throwing until I'm covered in blood?"
"Grrrk! Grrk!"
Contrary to my fears, it let out a joyful howl.
It must have thought I was dead because I didn't react to the slingshot.
Click- Click- Click- Click-
It quickly approached me.
I could feel how excited it was from the running.
I suppressed my excitement and carefully gauged the distance with sound. When I judged that it was close enough…
"You piece of shit!"
I jumped to my feet and reached out towards the goblin.
It was faster and had a longer effective range to extend my hand than to grab the shield and swing it.
However, I immediately felt that the plan was going awry.
Again, there were two reasons.
First, I was about a step away from the goblin.
And the goblin's movements were much faster than I expected.
"Grrk!"
It sidestepped and retreated.
I couldn't see it, but that was the feeling I got.
Instinctively, I realized I'd missed.
Damn it, what do I do now? I racked my brains for the next plan.
But at that moment, my body moved on its own.
"..."
It was a truly strange feeling.
My vision was still pitch black.
But I instinctively knew where the goblin had jumped.
The moment I realized that, my hand was already moving towards the goblin, changing its trajectory.
"Grrk?!"
I felt something catch in my fingertips.
I didn't care if it was its wrist, ankle, or neck.
"AAAAAAAH!"
I roared and slammed the goblin to the ground.  Crash! Something broke. But I couldn't relax, so I immediately climbed on top of the goblin.
"Grrk!"
The situation had changed now.
"I'm on top, you're on the bottom. You piece of shit!"
I slammed my face down like a madman.
I was so excited that I hit the ground a few times, but this barbarian's body was much stronger than I expected.
My fists didn't hurt at all, and the stone floor cracked instead.
"..."
Soon, the goblin's movements stopped.
And then…
Whirrrrrr!
Dust fluttered.
It was strangely luminous dust.
I stopped my punches.
Somehow, the goblin's body, which I was sitting on, was being pulverized and scattered.
I'm speechless.
"Damn it, is it this way again?"
Please, just decide on one thing.
The game, or this reality that's just similar.
It keeps confusing me about which rhythm to follow.
[Goblin defeated. EXP +1]
Soon, the goblin's body disappeared without a trace.
I felt an inexplicable sense of emptiness and picked up a small stone that had fallen there.
[Acquired 9th Grade Magic Stone]
It wasn't powerful, but it glowed faintly.
It was the magic stone that acted as currency in [Dungeon & Stone].
How much was it? The memory came back to me soon.
"A piece of bread."
The average value of a magic stone dropped by a goblin in the game.
I couldn't help but laugh.
"Khhhhhh..."
Is this all I got after all that?
My complicated head feels much clearer.
It's like that feeling when you cry a lot and then feel strangely like laughing.
"Khh, khhh."
There's a labyrinth, there are monsters.
Dead monsters drop loot and disappear.
And outside the city, real races live together.
This is definitely that kind of world.
But…
There will be no more confusing situations.
