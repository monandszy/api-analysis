Chapter 33: Warrior (1)
Monsters are categorized into four main types:
1. Variant: This refers to monsters with the same species values but different classes, such as a Goblin Archer and a Goblin Swordsman.
2. Superior: The Deathspine we encountered in the Land of the Dead falls under this category. It's important to note that this classification is relative. If a monster's rank is even one level higher than the average rank for its corresponding floor, it is considered a superior species.
3. Rare: This category includes monsters like the Corpse Golem, which can only be found in specific fissures, and the Mimic, which is extremely rare to encounter in general fields.
4. Superior Variant: This refers to Named Monsters, possessing individual memories and unique names. Their most notable characteristic is their ‘Essence Power.’ Simply put, they are much stronger and more challenging. Imagine an Ogre, renowned for its thick hide, acquiring a Troll’s regenerative ability. The result would be a monstrous abomination. Therefore...

I’m sprinting with all my might.
“What the hell is that thing?! Why is a Vampire here…?”
“Stop whining and run, Dwarf.”
Escaping the boss room entrance,
“Ugh, ugh, I can’t run anymore…,”
“Excuse me, Raven.”
Passing through the water pipes along our path,
“We can’t leave this place unless we kill that thing. Wouldn't it be better to fight it?”
“We need to get to a place with sunlight.”
“Sunlight? You mean that crimson sky?”
“Still better than here.”
Even after entering the labyrinthine underground prison.
“Turn left here!”
We continue to run at full speed. After all, this is his home turf. We need to get outside, somehow. That's our only chance of survival.
“A Superior Variant as a guardian… this is unprecedented.”
Well, not exactly. Even the ‘White Shrine’ on the 3rd floor has a Superior Variant as its guardian. Starting from the 8th floor, classified as the deep levels, you could say that every fissure is like that.  While it's true that it's unprecedented if you consider only the 1st floor.
Even I, a 9-year veteran with over 10,000 hours of gameplay, had never encountered the ‘Vampire Duke’ before. I only learned of its existence after seeing a recorded video uploaded by another player on the only community site.
“Ah, right! How did Bjorn know about this earlier? You told us to close the door!”
That damn thirst for knowledge is still going strong even in this situation.
“I’ve already said, run while you have the chance.”
“But I’m not the one running, am I?”
Yeah, you’re not. But I am.
“…I just had a hunch.”
I dodged the question to avoid further annoyance. However, if I were to answer honestly…
The reason I sensed something amiss was the color of the doorknob. In the recorded video uploaded by that user, it was the only thing that looked different from the usual Blood Citadel. I tried hundreds of times with the same conditions as that user, but the Vampire never appeared. I suspected there might be some special condition and kept replaying the video, only to finally discover that small change. If Yeon didn't get carried away with his luck, maybe he would have noticed it before opening the door? I don't think it's something to worry about now.
“Rude guests you are.”
The creature appeared as soon as we reached the 2nd floor of the underground prison.
Whoosh!
It was chasing us in the form of black mist, not a human. It wasn’t the Vampire's own ability, but one of the dozens of black magic spells it possessed, ‘Soul Embodiment.’ This is why I hate monsters who use magic. Their versatility is insane.
“Raven!”
I immediately called for our mage. I wanted to ask if she could use Sun magic, a counter to Vampires. But was this an unnecessary intervention?
“Everyone close your eyes!”
The mage girl had already finished casting.
“Ahesenbergelt, Two!”
‘Flare Burst.’ It’s usually used as a wide-area blind spell, a support spell. Even with my eyes closed, I could feel the blinding flash.
Beep, beep.
Ignoring the ringing in my ears, I opened my eyes and saw the black smoke that had been chasing us disappear. Thank goodness. We managed to prevent the core combo of ‘Soul Embodiment,’ ‘Materialization.’ It’s safe to say we’ve bought ourselves at least 3 minutes. By now, the creature should have woken up from that worship chamber.
But, good news always comes with bad news, doesn’t it?
“Bjorn! The mage is down!”
“What?!”
I looked closer at Ainar's words, and saw that the carrier was holding Raven, who had fainted. Blood was trickling from her mouth, possibly an internal injury.
…What? Did that bastard use some kind of magic? He can’t use attack magic while in ‘Soul Embodiment.’ 
‘Could it be Essence Power?’
Perhaps it could be. The recording didn’t show what happened, as the party got wiped out instantly. So, I couldn’t confirm what kind of monster’s Essence the Vampire Duke had acquired.
Various possibilities swirled in my mind, but I decided to deal with them later.
“What are you doing! Run!”
“The mage who knows the way is unconscious!”
“Don’t worry. I know the way.”
“…How do you know?”
I gave a brief answer to the perplexed dwarf.
“I memorized it.”
“Just from coming here once…?”
Actually, it was hundreds of times. I came here endlessly because I wanted to meet the Vampire Duke. Never thought I’d actually see his face, not behind a monitor.
“Follow me.”
I ignored any further questions and ran ahead. I guess Raven will think I’m some kind of weird Barbarian when she wakes up? So what? Survival comes first.
“You actually memorized the way…,”
The dwarf exclaimed when we reached the 1st underground floor without stopping.
“You guys really did have your coming-of-age ceremony last month, right?”
“Of course! I told you, Bjorn is a great warrior!”
“A great warrior… Maybe you will be one someday.”
Praise can make even a whale dance, but I'm not a whale. Please, just run harder instead of praising me. It’s been about 2 minutes.
Thud, thud, thud.
Left, right, straight, straight, right, left, straight, straight.
I ran without stopping, drawing a map in my mind, until I finally saw the exit. Was it about 3 minutes now?
Before climbing the stairs, I took one last look behind me.
“Huff, huff…,”
Everyone was breathing heavily, but they were all in good shape, so no one was lagging behind. The problem was the dark smoke that was following us.
Whoosh!
Maybe I should’ve just dumped all my luggage? I could’ve gained some more distance. 
It’s too late for regrets now. I need to focus on what I can do.
Thud, thud, thud!
I quickened my pace.
Did he use ‘Materialization?’
Clank, clank, clank.
I could hear something being assembled behind me. Now, it’s all or nothing.
I used my last burst of energy and jumped two or three steps at a time. And…
“We’re out!”
We finally made it to the surface. No casualties.
“I was, worried, but it, really, doesn’t, seem to, be following…,”
The dwarf mumbled while catching his breath. Still, he couldn’t relax completely, his eyes fixed on the stairs leading down. He would know if he had eyes. We just bought ourselves a little more time.  The problem hasn’t been solved yet.
“…How long do you think we have?”
I looked towards the mountain ridge visible beyond the wall and shrugged at the dwarf’s question. I don’t know the exact time, but…
“It’s definitely not long.”
It’s clear that time is not on our side. Soon, that crimson sky will be completely black. We need to prepare before that happens.

“How is the mage’s condition?”
“She’s taken a potion, so she’ll regain consciousness soon.”
“Are you sure?”
“…She will, definitely.”
That's just your wishful thinking, kid.
Ugh, this idiot still doesn’t know what she got hit with, why she’s so messed up.
I spoke firmly.
“You’re going to have to pull your weight this time.”
“But…,”
But what, but?
“Do you want to die here?”
Sometimes, the most straightforward statement is the most effective. If we all die, he won’t be able to protect the mage by himself.
“…What do I do?”
He actually asked. In truth, nothing will change much. I just wanted him to prepare before the battle.
“Protect the mage. With your life, if you have to.”
“…Of course.”
His voice sounded rather confident. Okay, he’s good to go.
Now, the only thing left to do is…
“Let’s move to the outer wall. It’s slightly better for us with some cover.”
I made up an excuse and led the group to the outer wall. The best thing would be to leave them all here and go get it done myself, but… if the creature pops out while I’m gone, it’s game over.
“Scattering is not a good choice!”
The dwarf yelled something, but I ignored him and ran towards the fountain I had noticed earlier. I had to go get that item, which I couldn’t get earlier because I didn’t want to stand out.
Crash! Crumble, crumble.
The fountain was only filled with dry gravel. I broke the statue in the center and rummaged through the debris, retrieving a small box.
「Character has acquired the [Tears of the Goddess].」
The contents matched the game, and… more good news followed.
“This is…,”
I returned after putting the items in the boot's compartments, and saw Raven regaining consciousness.
“Vampire! What happened to the Vampire?”
“Managed to escape. But he’ll come back when the sun sets.”
“I see.”
She winced, still in pain. Now it’s my turn to ask questions.
“What exactly did you get hit with?”
After gulping down a potion the carrier offered, she replied with a half-dead voice.
“I’m not entirely sure… but based on the symptoms, cough… it’s probably… ‘Shared Pain.’ ”
‘Shared Pain.’
If that’s true, it’s a relief. The ‘Nightflare’ that has that skill is one of the 8th-rank monsters with the lowest base stats. If the creature’s essence was 6th rank, or even 7th, the difficulty would have been much higher.
“Ugh… It happened right when I was trying to cast another spell, causing a backlash…,”
Raven squeezed the collar of her chest-plate, looking pained.  Seeing her like that, I felt a little bad. It will take some time for her to be able to do her job again.
“How long will it take to recover?”
“Ugh, full recovery is impossible. My circuits are completely messed up.”
“Just tell me the percentage, even a rough estimate.”
“20 minutes? That’s enough time for me to recover enough to cast 5th-rank attack spells, maybe 5 times.”
Five blasts of Firestorm-level spells. This is serious.
“Do you know any other Sun magic spells?”
“You know, it’s quite rude to ask a mage about their spells, don’t you?”
Of course, I know that, in the lore. But right now, I’m a Barbarian who talks down to everyone except the king.
I answered with a ‘so what’ look. Raven sighed and replied.
“I can use ‘Dark Spot Orb.’ ”
“Dark Spot Orb…,”
It’s a 6th-rank attack spell with the same basic form as a Fireball, but uses Sun attribute instead of fire.  Maybe we can actually fight back with this.
“Can you also cast ‘Attribute Enhancement’ on ‘Dark Spot Orb’?”
“…If I spend 10 minutes gathering magic.”
“That’s good enough. We’ll hold off until then. Don’t try to help, save your magic.”
“Yes, I will… wait, why is Jandel taking charge?”
The mage is quick-witted. The dwarf was just following me after I took the lead.
“Who else would it be?”
She glanced at the carrier, Ainar, and the dwarf in turn, before nodding in understanding.
“Yeah, that’s… true.”
“Hah! Sorry! It’s not like I can help it.”
The dwarf scratched the back of his neck, looking embarrassed.  Ainar saw his chance and jumped into the conversation.
“So you’re acknowledging that the Barbarian is better than a Dwarf!”
“That’s not true! It’s just that this friend of ours is special, as the Barbarian girl said. I could feel it, even if it was just for a short time.”
“Special…?”
“I’m confident in my ability to judge people, you see.”
Raven was curious about what happened while she was unconscious, but unfortunately, we don’t have time for that.
“Murad, how many Essences do you have?”
“Four.”
“What types?”
I fired questions, quickly and concisely, assessing the dwarf’s power. He doesn’t have any trump cards that could turn the tide, but…  I can see a strategy forming in my head. The only downside is that I don’t have time to share it with the team.
Whoosh!
A cool breeze blew, and the shadows covering the ground grew thicker. We have 30 minutes left before the preparations are complete.
「Night has fallen.」
There’s no turning back now. We have to hold on, somehow.
