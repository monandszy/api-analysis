Chapter 95 Barbarian Trophy (2)
He tears into the meat, gulping down the alcohol. He wipes his dirty hands roughly on the tablecloth. The reason for all this is simple.  “It’s what Baron Martoang wants, and it will benefit me anyway.”
I am currently in the Count’s banquet hall. With so many people gathered, it’s only right to act like a barbarian.  The more savage the rumors about me, the better.  They will serve as a shield when someone inevitably accuses me of being a demon.
“Excuse me, could I touch your bicep?”
“Go ahead.”
“Oh my, I touched it!”
In my barbarian guise, I’m enjoying the banquet as curious nobles approach me. It feels like I’m doing a puppet show.
“Say, could you yell like that again?”
“BEHELLLLLAAA!”
“Ha ha, what a bold fellow!”
As I play the part,  fulfilling my commission from the Baron, more and more people gather. Among them are knights. Three in total, and all three look displeased. They’re jealous that the attention is on me and everyone’s being so friendly.
“He’s not Little Balkan, he’s Little Jester.”
“Well, they say he’s called that because he’s little down there.”
“He’s just sucking up like this?  A warrior’s pride is a thing of the past, it seems.”
I pretend not to hear. It’s ridiculous to see these “knight apprentices” with their mere 3-tier explorer level strength trying to be like this. And besides, there’s no benefit to creating a conflict.
“Ha ha, you’re here!”
After I’ve eaten my fill and entertained the nobles, Baron Martoang returns. He looks around, grinning happily.
“Sorry to interrupt.  I have someone I want to introduce.  I’ll take him away now.”
“Ah …!”
The Baron leads me to the banquet hall inside the mansion. It’s a completely different atmosphere from the outdoor area where I was before.  There, a band played lively tunes and young couples danced in the garden. But what’s here? 
“This is a true gathering of nobles.”
A quiet, soft music drifts in the room.  The people sitting at the tables, engaged in conversation, are maintaining their composure and dignity.
“Come along.”
As I follow the Baron, I keep my eyes peeled.  The interior banquet hall is packed with around two hundred guests. Most of them are direct blood relatives of the Baron, like his young son, or people with significant social positions, like a bank manager or a guild branch head.
“You’ll be meeting people with higher titles than me, so try to avoid being rude.”
From that point, I follow the Baron as he introduces me to the titled nobles.
“Baron Martoang! It’s been a while… Who’s this?”
“You might have heard of him, Viscount.  Little Balkan.  He’s quite famous among explorers these days.”
“Oh, you?  I’ve heard of him.  But how did you come to be with him?”
When the Viscount asks, the Baron doesn’t answer but simply gestures at me with his eyes. He’s telling me to say what I’ve prepared.
“The Baron saved me when I was in trouble.  I’ve pledged to protect him for a while in return.”
“Haha!  To hear such words from a barbarian who looks so strong as you, well, I’m envious!”
“Nothing special.  I said I didn’t need to, that I’m burdened enough, but...”
The Baron trails off, looking at me again. 
“...Warriors never forget a kindness.”
“Ah!  A truly sincere and honorable belief.  You’re Björn, son of Yandell, right?  I’ll remember your name.”
This type of conversation continues for thirteen rounds.  It’s because there are only thirteen titled nobles, excluding the Count who hosted the banquet.  Even in the game, only a handful of titled nobles hold even the slightest bit of land in this city, so they are rare indeed. 
“Well, since the introductions are over, you can rest beside me until the Count arrives.”
After making the rounds, I simply stand beside the Baron, diligently playing the role of trophy.  But is it because the Baron is here? Or maybe my warning earlier worked? 
“...Tsk.”
I don’t know, but the butler, whenever our eyes meet, just clicks his tongue, turns away, and doesn’t nitpick every little thing and make me feel uncomfortable like before.  Is this the barbarian life?
“I should have done this from the start.”
Regardless, after that, it was pretty relaxing.  Baron Martoang never made the first move to stand up. I just had to stand there, and countless people approached me just for the chance to meet me. And I just showed off when the Baron asked.  
“Oh!”
“Indeed, the name Little Balkan is not in vain, my Lord!”
Things like bending a steel rod with my bare hands that I prepared, or arm wrestling. Time passed as I did these things.
Then, a familiar face appeared amidst the approaching crowd. 
“The star that rises at twilight will guide us. Greetings, Baron Martoang, and… ”
“Björn, son of Yandell.”
“Haha, pardon me, Sir Yandell.  I’m not good with names.”
The paladins in white armor smiled kindly at me as I revealed my name.  It was the one I had met after completing the sewage mission.  I had briefly met him in the late hours, while delivering the body of Elisa Behenke to him. His name was…
“You know Commander Crovitz?”
Paal Crovitz.  That was definitely his name.  But...
“… Commander?  Him?”
I stared at him, surprised, at the Baron’s words. The man scratched the back of his head, looking embarrassed. 
“Despite my shortcomings, I have been fortunate enough to assume the role of Commander of the Third Paladin Order.”
“I see...”
I was really bewildered. Because of the late-night corpse retrieval task, I hadn’t given it much thought.  Commander of the Paladin Order?  That means he’s a monster with 8-tier explorer level strength or higher. 
“If you need someone to lean on, please visit our Order.  As I said before, our Order will not forget Sir Yandell’s contributions and will always remember them.”
Well, I thought it was just an empty phrase at the time.  But hearing this from a man who actually holds the position of commander, I need to visit them sometime.  You never know.  Maybe I can’t yet, but if I build a relationship with them, they might send a priest to my team in the future.
“Hm, contributions?  Commander Crovitz, what do you mean?”
The Baron chimed in during the conversation, his voice soft but interested.  It’s understandable he wouldn’t easily imagine a barbarian making contributions to the Order.
“Ah, I didn’t mention it. “
Crovitz looked not only at the Baron but also at everyone around him, telling the story as if reading a children’s book. It was a pretty simple story.  I found a priest of Karui in the maze.  Not only that, but I tracked down and killed the wicked woman hiding in the sewers. It was just that, nothing more.  But Crovitz was quite a storyteller.
“Ah!  I’ve heard about it.  They say one of the Fiend’s眷属 appeared.  To think it was you who struck down this眷属.”
“Little Balkan, Björn, son of Yandell.  They say he was born for a heroic destiny.  Indeed…”
After the story ended, the Baron and those around him let out gasps of surprise.
“It’s a divine blessing from the stars.  Our Order treasures the bond with Sir Yandell.  Ah, I have some business, so I must take my leave...”
Crovitz, having gilded my image until the very end, excused himself to attend to his affairs.  And...
“You’re far more impressive than I thought, huh?”
The Baron’s gaze softened as he looked at me.

“Oh, so that’s what happened?”
“Commander Crovitz is known for his ability to judge people, so if he said that, you’re clearly destined for greatness.”
As Crovitz’s story spread discreetly among the nobles, the Count appeared and the banquet truly began.
“The Count of Ferdehilte will dine!”
The grand staircase connecting the second floor to the central one. A man descends majestically, his presence captivating everyone.  Beside him is his teenage daughter.  In a sense, she is the protagonist of this banquet.
“I thank you all for coming to celebrate my daughter Arabella’s birthday. I’ve prepared a variety of entertainment, so please enjoy yourselves, leave your worries behind, and have a good time!”
With the Count’s words, the music transforms into something lively, and the quiet interior banquet hall begins to buzz.  Quiet voices become louder, and laughter, far from dignified, erupts from all corners.  Well, they’re getting tipsy. They’ve been sipping wine since the start.
“Lady, may I have the honor of kissing your hand?”
The young people each grab the hands of the person they like and head outside to dance.  The older ones remain seated, enjoying the jester’s show and engaging in vulgar conversation.  Then…
“Let’s get going.”
The Baron rises from his seat.  He looks tense.  I ask where we’re going. He replies.
“You haven’t met the Count yet, have you?  I told him about you earlier, and he said he really wants to meet you.”
The Baron’s expression is completely different from when he was introducing me to the titled nobles. It’s like he’s facing his direct superior.  
“The Count…”
I feel a similar tension, but when I actually meet him, the Count is quite a jovial fellow.  And he’s very friendly towards me.
“Haha!  You’re the one?  I’ve been wanting to meet you.”
When I greet him, he actually stands up and shakes my hand.
“It’s a pleasure to meet you!”
Even as I respond with a barbarian handshake, I can’t shake off the feeling that something is off.  Little Balkan, Björn, son of Yandell. I’m aware that I’ve become famous recently.  But…
“Why is the Count doing this?”
Well, to be honest, I don’t think so.  In this vast city, there are barely a hundred nobles with the title of Count.  It’s not even comparable to the regional manager of the Explorer’s Guild I met before.  He’s truly a man of power, holding sway over everything.  Even in the game, events involving characters with Count or higher titles only happen towards the end of the game.  Yet…
“You’re taller than I thought.  At this rate, you’re not Little Balkan, you’re Big Balkan.  Haha!”
The Count praises me with a smile.  As if he desperately wants my favor.
“But what’s that weapon?  I heard you usually use a mace.”
He keeps subtly mentioning details that he wouldn’t know unless he had been paying attention to me.
“Why?”
I don’t understand.  If he wanted to, he could control any of the top 7- or 8-tier explorers, who have far more fame than me.  Why is he interested in me? 
“Damn it, I’m getting anxious.”
Some people might be happy to get attention from a powerful figure like the Count, but I’m not one of them.  And wasn’t I constantly on edge, expecting something to blow up any day now? 
“Something’s going to happen.  What is it?”
My learned anxiety starts to automatically imagine the worst-case scenarios involving the Count, one by one. 
“A funny thought popped into my head when I saw you.”
The Count claps, looking at me.  And he makes an unexpected proposal. 
“There’s going to be a showdown between the knight apprentices later.  How about you participate?”
“…Won’t the knights object?”
“That’s my problem.  How about it?”
“I’ll think about it…”
I avoid a definite answer, using an ambiguous tone.  It’s less problematic to tell him my decision through the Baron later than to refuse him to his face.
“Hm, well then.  Do whatever you want.”
The Count seems to be ending his interest in me there.  And he engages in light conversation with the Baron.  They compliment each other’s children, bless each other’s families, and chat about superficial things.
“Ha ha, I’ve been enjoying our conversation so much, I’ve kept you too long.  Go ahead and enjoy the banquet.”
“Yes.”
I leave the Count and return to my table. The Baron immediately approaches me. 
“So, how about it?  About that thing earlier?”
“You mean…?”
“The showdown!”
So that’s what he wanted to talk about. I tell him I’m still thinking about it. It’s better to say I’m still considering it, even if I’m going to decline, as it makes me look more diligent.
“Think it over carefully.  You never know, this might be beneficial for you.”
As I expected, the Baron starts trying to persuade me with the advantages of participating in the tournament.  Just for participating, I’ll get 2 million stones, or it’s a good opportunity to build my fame, or maybe the Count’s prize for winning the tournament is a 7,000-tier numbered item.
“What?  Garpas’ Necklace?”
“… Why are you so surprised?  Do you know about it?”
The Baron, not an explorer himself, tilts his head in confusion at my reaction.  It’s a good thing.  If he were an explorer, my reaction would have been even more suspicious.
“Hmm, I heard from Sir Elta that it’s not a very appealing item.”
No. 7777 Garpas’ Necklace.  Only drops from the 5th tier crack, with a ridiculously low drop rate, making it extremely difficult to obtain.  It’s similar to the Frost Spirit Ring in many ways.  Low numbered item.  Unique properties, but not very valuable to explorers.  Therefore, despite its rarity, it’s considered a dud of sorts.  And…
“It has a hidden special event, too.”
I don’t take long to decide.  Is it a gut feeling that something’s about to happen? Or a determination to stay out of the spotlight for a while?  A chuckle escapes my lips.  What does it matter?  It doesn’t mean I should be overly cautious and calculate every gain and loss, paralyzing myself in the process.  That would be a complete reversal of roles.
“I will.”
“Huh?  What did you just say?”
“I’ll participate in the showdown that the Count talked about.”
“Ah?  Why are you so surprised?”
“I’m going to give the showdown the Count mentioned a try.”
“You… what?”
I know he doesn’t understand what I’m saying, but he seems to have been taken aback.
“Don’t be so surprised.  If it turns out to be helpful for me, it’s not like I’m going to pass up this chance, right?” 
“You’re right, but... you really want to take part in this?” 
I can hear the concern in his voice, but I’m not going to be dissuaded.
“Yes, I will,” I repeat, trying to make my voice sound confident.
“Alright, I won’t try to stop you.  Just know that you’re putting your neck on the line.”
The Baron looks at me, his eyes filled with concern.  I can’t help but smile.  The truth is, I don’t know if this is the right decision.  It feels like a gamble. But it’s a gamble I’m willing to take.
“Alright,” I say, nodding confidently.  “I’m ready to fight.” 
The Baron’s expression is unreadable.  He looks at me, then at the crowd.  Then, he lets out a sigh.
“Well, good luck then.  I’ll be watching.”
The Baron turns and walks away, leaving me to my own thoughts.  I watch him go, my heart pounding.  This is it.  I’m ready for whatever comes next.
I take a deep breath, trying to calm myself.  I’ve made my decision, and now it’s time to see it through.  I look around at the crowd, my eyes scanning the faces of the knights and nobles.  I see excitement, curiosity, and even a hint of fear.  I know I’m not the only one who senses that something big is about to happen. 
I smile, a sense of determination growing within me.  I’m a barbarian, and I’m not afraid of a challenge.  I’m ready to fight.
