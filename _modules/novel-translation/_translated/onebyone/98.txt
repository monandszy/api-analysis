Chapter 98: Barbarian Trophy (5)
Sadly, the opponent I faced in the semi-finals wasn't Knight Samdol's last man. The other one had lost in the second round, seemingly deliberately. 
"He couldn't get a free physical therapy session after all," I mused.
Anyway, since I didn't need to target his head anymore, I smashed his sword with my double-edged axe right at the start of the duel.
But maybe the barbarian didn't want to lose to me?
"I'm not done yet!"
He displayed his will to continue the fight even after losing his sword, so I discarded my axe and ran towards him, breaking his spine.
"Th-the winner is Baron Martoang's Bjorn Jandel!"
It was a bloodless victory, but the audience's reaction was not bad.
"Wooooah!"
"Bjorn, the son of the Little Balkan Jandel, the Knight Smasher!"
Apparently, seeing a man folded in half was quite stimulating for them. The Baron's reaction wasn't much different.
As soon as I returned to the tent, he bombarded me with questions, eyes wide.
"You know, that was amazing! Tossing someone in the air and then catching them with your knee... where did you learn such a technique?"
Well, if I had to answer, I'd say I saw it in a comic book. It was the first time I realized it could be physically possible. 
"There truly is no impossible for a barbarian."
"I'll rest for a while until the next match."
"Huh? Ah, alright."
After getting the Baron's permission, I took a nap. Not that I was sleepy...
"Only one left, huh."
As the finish line was in sight, my heart started to pound.
***
The long-awaited final match was about to begin.
"Count Ferdehilt's Sir Albatross and Baron Martoang's Bjorn Jandel, take your positions!"
My opponent was a squire under Count Ferdehilt, who had hosted this gathering and encouraged me to participate in the tournament...
I wasn't particularly worried about the duel itself, not after the previous matches. I had fully assessed my opponent.
"Greetings."
The giant knight with a huge greatsword offered a short greeting. I let out a chuckle as I looked at him.
"I think I understand what kind of person the Count is."
Knights are different from adventurers. For them, essence is merely a means to support their swordsmanship. Therefore, they usually choose essence related to physical attributes, and the combinations differ according to each family.
Several efficient combinations have become the norm after systematic research, but... 
"A character has a concept," I thought.
"An Orc Berserker, Giant Golem, and a Cyclops... He's a typical strength-based knight."
He had prioritized physical resilience over regeneration, likely keeping the Cleric in mind. He had also donned a full set of Lythinium armor using his high strength. He was practically a walking tank.
"The Count sure invested a lot of money in his squire."
While guessing the Count's tastes, I was once again amazed by his wealth. One rank 7 essence and two rank 6 essences. He must have purchased the essence contained in vials and fed it to his squire. Just how much did it cost? 
"Including his equipment, he's far surpassed the level of a 3rd-tier adventurer."
Suddenly, I wondered if the Count hadn't considered my chances of winning. This guy's level was truly exceptional. Most of the participants were level 2 and only had rank 7 essences.
"Where's your equipment? You're barehanded."
Just before the duel began, as we were facing each other with our weapons, he questioned me. He must have been curious about my appearance, since I only carried an axe unlike the previous duels.
I gave a short reply.
"It's uncomfortable."
It wasn't meant as a mockery. It was the truth. Heavy plate shoes, overly designed helmets, belts, shoulder guards, and so on. It's one thing to expect little defense from them, but they shouldn't hinder your movements.
"I see. It would be hard to fight normally while wearing that."
Thankfully, he didn't misinterpret my words. But that was all.
"I was worried it would end too easily, but it's reassuring to see you taking this seriously."
That relaxed expression and tone... it must be his way of showing his confidence that he'd win no matter what I did. I didn't feel the need to continue the conversation.
"That's good."
If he was going to be careless, then it would be a good thing.
"Swoosh."
I separated our weapons and created some distance. He did the same.
When the distance between us reached about 15 meters, the referee raised his flag. It was a signal that we could attack each other.
"Come."
The knight took his stance and tapped his sword. As I watched him, a scenario he was expecting seemed to unfold in my mind.
The barbarian who showed overwhelming force to earn the new title of "Knight Smasher". 
A true knight who gracefully defeats such a barbarian. The cheers of the audience and the recognition of his lord. 
A bright future that unfolds like a paved road.
"Heh."
I could feel how easily he had lived his life. Whether my prediction was right or not, he had to be more eager for what he wanted. He shouldn't only focus on how good things could get if they went well, but always consider the opposite.
"Still, he's letting his guard down like this... I'm glad I kept this hidden until the end."
The tournament hosted by the Count.
"Behâ€”Laaaaaaaa!"
For the first time, I used that combo.
***
"The character has activated [Enlargement]."
"The character's physique increases, and their threat and physical stats increase proportionally."
"The character has activated [Wild Release]."
"The character's threat level temporarily increases three-fold, and their physical stats increase proportionally to that."
***
[Enlargement] and [Wild Release]. Using these two skills together makes the threat level rise dramatically. Consequently, physical stats increase exponentially.
The downside of [Wild Release] is that it only lasts 30 seconds, but...
So what?
At least, for now, I can enjoy this insane power trip.
"Well, I didn't expect it to end so easily."
Was this an unintended consequence of the threat level rising too high? Regardless of the target's personality, the threat level simply acted.
"W-w-what... ?"
The overwhelming fear I bestowed upon my enemy.
"Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!"
Despite making sounds like a giant monster as I charged, the knight was frozen in fear, unable to move.
However, just as I was about to bring my axe down, he rolled on the ground, dodging my attack. Then, he started running away in a panic.
But there was no way he could escape forever in this narrow arena. I cornered him like in a boxing game, reaching out to grab him.
At that moment...
"He's out of bounds!"
He escaped entirely, and the final match ended without a proper fight.
"I'm relieved, actually..."
The audience's reaction was cold. Thankfully, there was no blame directed at me, but the knight who showed such a dishonorable act was bombarded with harsh jeering.
"N-no, that wasn't intentional! I-I-I can do it again!"
He finally seemed to come to his senses and climbed back onto the stage, but it was like a man crying over spilled milk.
"How far do you intend to disgrace me?"
As he pleaded with the referee to have the fight re-done, the Count's cold words made him droop his head.
"The winner is Baron Martoang's Bjorn Jandel!"
Man, I shouldn't have used [Enlargement].
I had that thought too late. It was a simple victory, but even I felt a little uneasy about it.
"I somehow managed to piss off the Count..."
It was bad news for me, who was more concerned about the aftermath than actually winning the tournament. My actions to eliminate any variables by hiding my full strength until the last moment had created a new variable.
"Damn it, I never thought he would run away like that."
Psh, he won't try to harm me because of this, will he?
I was secretly worried, but the Count simply laughed cheerfully while ascending the stage and presenting me with the necklace and trophy, the prizes for winning.
"Haha! Today was quite impressive!"
He patted my arm since he couldn't reach my shoulders, encouraging me. I couldn't tell if he was genuinely not holding a grudge, or if he was just acting.
As I watched nervously, he whispered to me, only I could hear.
"I'll call for you separately when you're ready."
"... Call for me?"
"No need to know the details. Just ignore the calls from other nobles until then. Understood?"
I didn't understand what he meant, but I nodded anyway.  I had enough sense to understand that much.
"Those eyes... Scary..."
If I refused, he looked like he'd do something drastic.
Anyway, the award ceremony marked the end of the long gathering. Well, many people stayed to enjoy themselves until dawn...
Baron Martoang wasn't one of them.
"I'm tired. Let's go back."
We returned to his mansion with the same number of people as when we came. I got all my equipment back and received the promised payment.
"You worked hard today. It's certain that your name and my family's will be the talk of the social circles for the next few months. So, if you run into any trouble, don't hesitate to ask me for help."
He seemed to be quite fond of me. It might have been just a polite statement, but he said it like he meant it.
"I've done so much for him... I'd be glad."
"Then go. I'm tired too. I had a carriage prepared, so you can just take that."
"Thanks!"
I left the Imperial City, Carnon, and returned to my lodging in Ravigion past 2 am. My body and mind were exhausted after a day full of events, but...
"Alright, let's get started then."
Instead of lying down on the bed, I sat at the table.
I began to do my final accounting.
The initial payment I was promised: 1 million stones.
The tournament entry fee: 2 million stones.
The bonus payment for winning: 1 million stones.
The compensation for handing over the winning trophy to the Baron: 300,000 stones.
"In total, 4.3 million stones in cash."
Maybe it was because the client was a rich noble?  The amount was too much to be considered a daily wage.
But that wasn't all.
I had gotten a new nickname, "Knight Smasher." 
"I never expected to get this so early..."
The No. 7777 Garpas Necklace. I got something that could be impossible to obtain even after grinding endlessly in the late game, if I was unlucky.
Of course, waking up the hidden piece would require a massive amount of resources, but...
It's undeniable that I'm incredibly lucky.
Therefore, I once again reminded myself,
"How many lucky stacks have I already accumulated?"
I need to be careful from now on, even when breathing.
***
The morning after the gathering, one of my questions was answered, or at least partially.
"What are these letters...?"
As soon as I woke up, letters began to arrive non-stop. All of them were from nobles. They were inviting me to gatherings they were hosting, promising "a modest reward" for participation.
It was modest in name only. I could earn enough to live my whole life just by doing this, but...
"This was what the Count meant."
His words about calling for me separately when I was ready still didn't make sense, but it was clear that he was referring to this.
"Ugh, how much money am I missing out on?"
I responded to all of them with a polite refusal. If I ignored them, those proud nobles might retaliate. But if I accepted, I might anger the Count.
"What is the Count thinking?"
Honestly, he's the one I fear the most. He had been friendly towards me all this time, but this kind of guy flips out when things go wrong.  It was also unnerving that his intentions were unclear. 
Why would someone like a Count care about a barbarian adventurer?
"I should investigate the Count too, when the community next opens."
I wrote down a new quest in my head and quickly finished getting ready.
I headed towards the mage tower.
"My scheduled research will be ending this month."
The three months I promised Raven were almost over.  Not that my visit today had anything to do with that.
"Oh, you're here?"
Raven greeted me with a smile, surprisingly normal for a change, as I arrived at her private study. 
"So, where's the senior I'm supposed to help research today?"
"Well, that's... "
She trailed off.
It was just that, but a bad feeling crept up on me.
Right then.
"Long time no see."
A white-haired old man popped out from behind the door, as if he had been waiting.
The Master of the Artemion School. 
The so-called "Old Man."
"Ugh..."
I understood the situation without further explanation.
"I'm pretty sure you told me he's my 'senior.'"
"I'm sorry. Master insisted, so I had to... "
Yeah, she had to change it against her will.
I glanced at him, and the old man chuckled amiably.
"Heh heh, don't be nervous. It's not a big experiment, you see."
I'll believe that when I hear it.
I gave him a look, demanding an explanation, and he opened his mouth with a meaningful tone.
"The old man has made a magical device to test whether or not the souls of evil spirits can be identified!"
No, god damn it.
What the hell is this?
