Chapter 68: Barbarian Hero (1)
[The Gap of Evil]
This was a kind of area-of-effect instant kill that appeared when Riakis absorbed more than ten orbs. If you didn't escape within the time limit, you would die, no matter how hard you had trained your character. In game time, it was about 45 minutes. And there was one particular characteristic here...
It would drag you to the center, no matter where you were.
Whoooosh!
Before I could adjust to the darkness in front of me, a sensation as if I were being pulled tightly spread through my body.
"Bi, yo, rn...!! Thi, is, how, —!"
For some reason, Misha's voice sounded at 0.5x speed.
So I spoke at 2x speed.
"Don't worry, you won't die right away."
"Wha, is, tha, —!"
Misha shouted slowly, but her shout never finished.
Complete silence, as if my hearing had vanished.
Of course, it didn't last long by itself.
[All characters within the radius will move to the center of evil.]
When I opened my eyes, there was light.
"Bjorn!"
The sounds were normal again, and I could see many figures besides Misha.
"Where is this...?”
"Wha, what! I was definitely running away...”
There were about 200 explorers, a considerable number.
Leaving Misha, who was clinging to me with a worried expression, I checked a place.
Those with the Dzarwi clan's emblem were quickly gathering among themselves and forming formations.
‘Are there only this many left out of 50...?’
Just over 20.
The number of deaths during the three hours of fighting Riakis was 11, but more than that number had disappeared in less than five minutes.
What the hell happened in that short period of time?
Well, it wasn't hard to guess.
"Hey! If you know what's going on here—"
"Shut up, you trash."
A voice filled with rage erupted in response to one explorer's question.
"Because of trash like you... do you know how many people have died!"
"If you come any closer, I will attack immediately."
The Dzarwi clan were actually huddled together, guarding themselves so that no one could approach them.
The explorers were also taken aback.
"Wh, why is that our fault!"
"If you hadn't taken our equipment in the first place, this wouldn't have happened!"
"I heard that the large clans swear to the guild and the royal family that they will do their duty in emergencies. Let's clear things up later, but for now, let's all work together..."
"Ple, please let me in! I never joined in the first place. If you want me to pay more protection money, I'll pay..."
The explorers, who didn't even know what situation they were in, roared in protest.
Well, they would know.
They know that if they are abandoned by them, they will have no chance of survival.
But what can I do?
"Consider yourselves lucky that I'm not killing you right now. Trash."
The Dzarwi clan's will was resolute.
"Th, that's an unfair and selfish thing to say! You're saying we should all go out and die!"
"You got it."
"...Wh, what? Don't push us too far! Do you think we'll just stand by and let this happen?"
The man who had been leading the charge at the forefront.
Jack Fletcher's shout was echoed by many explorers, but the clan just laughed in disdain.
"What if we don't?"
"Well, we'll combine our forces and—"
"Let me tell you this, don't expect to be swayed as easily as before. We could burn you all to death right here if we wanted to, because trash like you is nothing to us."
It wasn't empty boasting.
And it’s true, the situation is different this time.
Unlike before when we were spread out to deal with Riakis, they are now in a proper dense formation.
It seems they are also ready to unleash magic at any time.
"Damn it!"
"Do you think we'll die just because you're not here!"
It was then that the explorers realized their reality.
"I, I know about this phenomenon."
A human man who looked about 160 cm tall opened his mouth in front of the crowd.
"You know about this phenomenon?"
"We, I don't know the details. But if we don't leave this place in time, we'll all die. It was written in an old book."
"...Is that true?"
Jack Fletcher cast a suspicious look at the seemingly simple man, and a woman stepped forward to replace him.
"I'll vouch for him!"
"Elf?"
"I've been on a team with him for over a year. And we've been through a lot of unbelievable things. He's a mysterious man. He really knows everything. I have no doubt that his words will save us."
Jack Fletcher changed his expression.
"If the elf says so... it might be worth listening to. Hey, how do we escape from here?"
"Th, there isn't really a way! I, I heard that we just have to go in any direction for about 5 km and we can escape... ”
Amazingly, that human man's words were true.
The problem is that the moment we leave this place where there is light, Riakis' avatars will come out from the darkness.
"We, we heard there are monsters, but if we all combine our forces, we'll de, definitely be able to do it!"
"Hmm, there's some merit to that."
Crap.
If it was that easy, those clan people would have already run. Instead of looking like they've eaten shit, they should be seriously discussing this with each other.
"Bjorn, what are you going to do?"
"What?"
"But seeing an elf vouch for a human like that, he must be a really human who knows something, right?"
Hmm, is that right?
He just looks like a moron to me...
"Don't be swayed by that kind of thing, just wait calmly."
"Okay!"
Anyway, the situation developed quickly after that.
"The elf's vouch is there, but there's definitely a chance that this man's words are wrong. But! Rather than just waiting for death, I want to try this place!"
As Jack Fletcher made his decision and started to stir things up again, the tide slowly began to turn.
"Yeah, we're going to die here or there anyway!"
"There's no way those guys are going to help us anyway, what else can we do?"
"There are so many people, it'll be fine somehow!"
"But, no matter how you think about it, I don't think it's going to be that easy..."
While many people were skeptical, they started to gather together, and the thought that they might be left behind accelerated the process.
And now.
"I'll ask one last time! If anyone wants to join us, come out now!"
More than 100 explorers rallied together.
There were only about 40 of us left, including me and Misha.
Jack Fletcher scanned us, found me, and spoke to me.
"You're the son of the Yandere, Viagron, aren't you?"
"...Bjorn, the son of Yandell."
"Hmm, was it? Anyway, you're not going to come with us?"
Why are you asking so annoyingly?  You already know that by me being here, right?
I just shrugged my shoulders in response.
But...
"Typical of a barbarian, you're stupid. You're going to regret it."
What the fuck? What is this?
Just go your own way, why are you doing this in the end?
I can't understand his psychology, but it's my belief to give back what I've received, so I gave him a similar compliment.
"What are you talking about? You're going to die soon. Don't talk back, just go die quickly. That's more helpful to the world."
"Wha, what?"
"Do you want to fight me? Then come here. I'll crush your empty head."
I grabbed my mace and walked forward, ignoring the 100 explorers behind him. He turned his head.
And muttered to himself as he left.
"I was trying to help you... ”
"There's no one else who wants to come, so let's go! We don't have time to waste on this!"
No matter what happened.
More than half of the people disappeared into the darkness.
Or, at this point, is it more accurate to say they crawled into danger?
Anyway, as they left, Misha, who had been waiting, stuck to me and whispered.
"Bjorn, what are we going to do?"
"Why do you always ask me that?"
"Well, you've always been right so far. I trust you."
"That's right."
I appreciate the words, but Misha is wrong.
My choice is not the right one.
How could a mere human know such things?
I just picked the one that seemed most likely, given the problem at hand.
And in that sense...
Thump-
I started walking towards the Dzarwi clan, who were in the middle of a heated discussion.
‘By now, they should have realized that they're in a bit of a pickle...’
It's time to gamble.
The gamble that I, through various reasons, have determined to have the highest chance of success.
"Stop, Barbarian. If you come any closer—"
They tried to stop me as I approached.
Coincidentally, the person who shouted was someone we knew.
"Oh, Oppaburning..."
"Half-breed... What are you doing here?"
A sudden reunion.
There was definitely no touching reunion of siblings, so I stood between them and asked playfully.
"Well, long time no see."
"...What? Long time no see?"
My sister's older brother scowled.
Well, we're not the kind of people who greet each other like that.
So while he was flustered, I immediately got to the point.
"So, did the Orc Hero's Essence come out?"
"Well, luckily, fortunately—"
Yes, you were lucky.
"Wait, how do you know that?"
He looked at me with terrifying eyes, and I smirked.
The gamble paid off.
At least half of it, anyway.
***
Dzarwi clan's deputy commander.
Iraz McGrane thought.
‘We're screwed.’
Total casualties: 27.
In proportion, it was 20% of the Dzarwi clan's total strength. I have no idea how long it will take to rebuild.
‘Well, there's no guarantee that we'll survive either.’
He opened his eyes and looked at the faces of his men.
Currently, there were 23 clan members alive.
Looking only at the numbers, it could be said that almost half of the force survived, but that was not the case.
He asked his adjutant.
"What exactly is our current strength?"
"There are three priests, six mages, and twelve long-range support, and… two melee warriors.”
A report in a disheartening voice.
Well, it would be.
"Only two melee warriors..."
The manpower distribution was beyond abnormal.
When the riot broke out, the warriors who didn’t receive support were almost wiped out.
"But it's fortunate. If it wasn't for the deputy commander's judgment, we wouldn't have had time to regroup—"
"That's something we can know after we come back alive."
McGrane took a quiet breath.
The moment he decided it was impossible to quell the riot, he gave one order. Let Riakis absorb the Dark Sphere.
Thanks to that, he was able to minimize casualties and buy time.
‘Yeah, time... It was just enough to buy time.’
"Hey, McGrane! What are you going to do now? You're not just going to give up everything, are you?"
"I'm thinking."
"Then you need to think quickly. If you've even studied a little bit about the chaos lord Riakis, you'll know we don't have much time left."
McGrane sighed at the mage, who spoke in a sharp voice.
"The stars that rise at dusk will guide us..."
The priests, who were praying with a cross, were a little better, but if I was disliked by them, I would definitely face a bad outcome, even if I came back alive.
‘Think, how can we maximize our chances of survival.’
McGrane thought and thought again.
What was the best thing he could do under the current circumstances.
"Deputy commander, the explorers are forming groups. It seems they are trying to escape on their own."
"That's good news for once. Leave them alone."
"Yes?"
"They're going to play bait, aren't they?"
He decided to take advantage of any positive variable.
He thought and thought about how to escape, how to arrange his men, and the best formation for movement.
He couldn’t find an answer.
"I've instructed everyone on the formation for movement. We're ready to move whenever."
He did his best to prepare, but...
‘Assuming that we get lucky, at least half will die.’
The lack of warriors was too fatal.
With only two warriors, they couldn’t even properly clear a path, and even those two were a swordsman and a spearsman.
Specialized defensive warriors.
In other words, there were no guardian-positioned explorers.
‘In a situation where they are more important than ever, we have to clear a path with only these people. It's crazy.’
Only one.
If there had been only one more explorer with a proper guardian position... things would have been much more positive...
"Deputy commander, the explorers have left."
"Hurry up and decide!"
McGrane closed his eyes, looking at the clan members who were looking at him.
"There are more than 100 of them. If we don't move when they draw some attention—"
"I know."
He didn’t have time.
He had to make a quick decision.
Just as McGrane was about to open his mouth, which he had been holding shut, a barbarian shouted.
As if he knew his worries, which no one else knew.
McGrane asked his adjutant, as if he were possessed.
"Hey, who is that guy, and why is he doing that?"
"I overheard a little bit, but it seems like he's a colleague of Mr. Calstain's sister. There's no need for the deputy commander to worry—"
"I'll be the one to judge that. Just answer me."
His adjutant then answered.
"I don't know how he knew, but... He's asking for the Orc Hero's Essence."
"The Orc Hero's Essence?"
"Yes, he said he can clear a path if he has that."
McGrane activated one of his abilities, [Survival Instinct], and looked back at the barbarian.
And muttered.
"This is the first time I've seen light shining so strongly from a human."
The ability that had saved him from countless crises was telling him.
That it was worth listening to him.
