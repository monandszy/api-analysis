Chapter 28: The Rift (2)
Daria Wittembert de Tercia, a seasoned explorer in her fifth year, was traversing the first floor of the Crystal Cave, accompanied by her young sister.
"Erwen, you've used magic again."
"Ah, sister, it was just too difficult with only a dagger..."
"I told you, even without a bow, even when you can't use magic, you need to be able to protect yourself."
"I know, but..."
"Enough, keep practicing as you walk, you'll get better."
Tercia relentlessly subjected Erwen to combat training as they explored the first floor. All for her little sister's sake. And Erwen knew it. 
But as time wore on, her exhaustion was evident.
"Ah, Uncle said it's best to specialize in what you're good at..."
"...What?"
"Trusting your team and doing your best at your job. That, that's the basis of exploration..."
Tercia, who had been listening blankly, was speechless. It was too much of a righteous statement. If only the world always worked so correctly.
"Erwen, teammates are just teammates. Don't put too much value on them."
Tercia had experienced many teams. From the six-floor exploration team she was recently with, to the hunting team that targeted high-profit monsters, to the running team that aimed for portal opening achievements. 
She had seen so much with different groups. There were many things she wouldn't want to tell Erwen about.
Teammates, they can't be trusted. Not unless they're blood relatives.
"I understand..."
Erwen didn't argue further, seeing Tercia's hardened expression.
Time passed, and it was their fourth day. Erwen, having circled the first floor clockwise, had grown to the point where she could defeat all monsters with just a dagger. 
Naturally, her level had also risen in the process.
"Sister, I've leveled up, can't we just go to the second floor? Uncle's probably already making a fortune on the second floor..."
Tercia laughed, finding it endearing.
What's the big deal about taking down a few more monsters on the second floor?
"Erwen, the rift is going to open soon."
The rift. A place even veteran adventurers with years of experience may never get to see, if they're unlucky.
Erwen tilted her head.
"How do you know?"
"The last time the rift opened on the first floor was eight months ago."
Tercia explained patiently, like she was teaching her younger sister. 
The statistical reason why the rift would open within three days, as it was their fourth day already.
"I see... Uncle didn't tell me that."
Well, of course he wouldn't.
Erwen always talked about her uncle, but in the end, she was still a novice. Right now, she was probably going through trial and error, recklessly climbing floors, a behavior that would be the epitome of inefficiency from an experienced adventurer's point of view.
"Erwen, don't be hasty, trust me. In a year, you and that barbarian will be worlds apart."
Sometimes, the slow path is the fastest.
"Hmm... Then I can help you then!"
"Yes, you do that."
Tercia nodded, impressed.
It was unlikely that the barbarian would even be alive by then, and even if he was, it wasn't like she couldn't help him later.
She wanted her sister to retain her innocence, at least for now.
It was at that moment.
Drrrrrrrrrrr!
As if an earthquake had struck, the labyrinth began to tremble. It was the phenomenon that occurred when the rift opened.
"Erwen!"
Tercia grabbed Erwen's hand and sprinted through the passageway. Soon, they found a portal that was shaking precariously.
It was the rift.
Perhaps, by now, thousands of similar portals had emerged across the first floor.
Now, every second counted.
Wooooong!
Tercia and Erwen threw themselves into the portal.
But at that moment.
Hwoong-
The portal disappeared.
Thud.
Tercia landed on the ground, having tumbled through the air, and clicked her tongue in disappointment.
"...Too late."
If they hadn't tried to enter at the same time, and had instead quickly sent her sister in first, they might have made it.
But...
"...There will be other chances."
It couldn't be helped.
What if her sister went into the rift alone and died? 
"Erwen, let's go to the second floor."
Again, sometimes the slow path is the fastest.
***
Equivalent Exchange.
I love this saying.
But sadly, the world doesn't revolve around this rule.
Just look at that psychopath I met.
I barely escaped with my life, and gained nothing.
'No, I even lost a lot of time being chased out of the Land of the Dead.'
But this time is different.
This time, I made the choice.
Therefore, there will be consequences.
Well, probably.
Thump.
I tensed up as I looked at the two remaining members of the team who had been matched with me: a human man and woman.
The man who landed with a thud had no particular features...
But the woman was different.
Tap.
As if defying the force of gravity, the woman slowly descended and landed softly.
This sight left even the talkative dwarf speechless, unable to hide his surprise.
I was the same.
"To think I'd see a mage here."
A mage. A profession that, just by virtue of its title, receives special treatment anywhere, the undisputed strongest class in [Dungeon & Stone].
"Bjorn, are mages really that great? Wasn't the librarian a mage too!"
The mage frowned, clearly displeased by Ainard's question.
I quickly spoke up before she could be offended.
"The librarian is a ninth-rank mage."
"Is it different?"
It is. And vastly so.
If they were the upper-class workers of guilds, public institutions, or workshops, this woman was what we call a true mage.
The fact that she entered the labyrinth was proof enough.
Mages are a vital resource for Raphdonia, and they cannot enter the labyrinth without proving their skills.
"I see!"
"Yes, indeed. You have a good eye for a barbarian."
The mage, with a satisfied smile on her lips, joined the conversation after I explained clearly, in a way she could understand. I had a feeling I knew her personality.
"Hello. I'm Aruwa Raven, a sixth-rank mage. This is Tarzin, my hired professional carrier. His name is... what was it again?"
Ah, so they were a package deal.
Anyway, it wasn't bad.
She had a hint of arrogance, looking down on people, but for a mage, that's considered tame.
I've seen worse in the game.
"May I ask for your introductions as well?"
"Hikurod Murad. It's a short journey, but I look forward to working with you, Raven."
"How many years have you been exploring, Mr. Murad?"
"Three years."
A three-year explorer...
No wonder his equipment was so stylish.
"I'm Bjorn, son of Yandel."
I asked directly, after a brief introduction.
"You wouldn't have any reason to be active on the first floor, so how did you enter the rift?"
Most explorers on the first floor are just kids with no decent gear.
That's why I expected to go through hell to clear the rift.
But a three-year dwarf and a sixth-rank mage?
This was more than just a coincidence.
"I can't explain the specifics, but I heard the rift was opening this cycle."
"Me too."
I wonder, is this a case of kicking down a ladder?
As if they had planned it, Raven and the dwarf kept their methods secret.
Of course, it didn't really matter.
I had a pretty good idea of how they figured it out.
"I'm Ainard, the second daughter of Pnellin."
As soon as everyone had introduced themselves, Raven took the lead.
"We'll divide the loot equally among everyone, excluding Tarzin. But can everyone follow my instructions?"
"No objections here. Following a mage's orders in a labyrinth is common sense."
"Thank you for saying so."
The dwarf gave his approval first, and Raven turned her gaze to the two of us.
It didn't take long to decide.
There was nothing good about sticking out when there's a mage on the team.
'It was mages who first noticed the existence of 'evil spirits' and convinced the royal family to declare them as objects of eradication.'
Damn it...
It's not about clearing the rift anymore.
"I agree."
Let's just split the loot 50/50.
Before, she complimented my observation skills, but who knows when that gaze will turn to suspicion.
I've seen plenty of messed up mages in the game.
"I refuse."
Huh?
Ainard's stubborn voice drew everyone's attention.
"I don't see what's so great about being a mage. I'd rather have Bjorn lead us."
What, I agreed, why are you doing this?
I want to shut her mouth right now, but that would make me look even more suspicious.
The mage cautiously asked,
"You're referring to this barbarian, right, Bjorn?"
"Yes. Bjorn isn't an ordinary barbarian!"
"Not ordinary? How so?"
"Bjorn is a wise warrior, unlike anyone else. He spends six hours a day in the library, reading books."
"Hmm, he's definitely unique."
"He's not unique, he's great! I've never seen a barbarian as smart as Bjorn!"
Damn it...
Please just stop...
***
Everyone looked at me with strange eyes after Ainard's praise, but it ended up being a farce.
They seemed to think it was just a barbarian's childish outburst.
At least for now.
"Still, majority rules, right? Ha ha ha!"
"What's majority rules, and why does it matter?!"
"Uh..."
I calmed Ainard down, sensing the atmosphere about to turn sour again.
But what was so infuriating? Ainard kept smirking, showing her displeasure.
"But! Bjorn, you're more awesome than that mage!"
Maybe she was upset by my previous comment about her having a "good eye for a barbarian"?
I wasn't sure, but I was glad I made her swear an oath earlier.
If I hadn't, she might have spilled everything, including the dimensional instability and the fact that I was the one who opened the rift.
"It's a blessing to be respected by your wife. I envy you, barbarian! Ha ha ha!"
"Ah, wife? That's not the case!"
"Ha ha ha! No need to be embarrassed!"
"Ugh! It's not about being embarrassed!!"
Whatever the content, the talkative dwarf managed to divert Ainard's attention.
I was relieved and looked at Raven's expression.
Contrary to my concerns, she wasn't particularly interested in me.
"Hmm, it's a barrier that prevents us from going out. Interesting. It seems to cut off dimensions, but how can we see the other side?"
It's a mage's thirst for knowledge, I guess.
She was mumbling to herself as she wrote in her notebook, curious about the mechanism of this barrier that blocked access to the map...
I just hope that interest doesn't turn towards me until we part ways.
"Everyone, let's go. We have a lot to investigate to get samples."
"Leave? We only know each other's names..."
The dwarf tilted his head, responding to Raven's instructions.
I felt the same way.
A team needs to know each other's abilities and what they can do.
Even if it's a hastily formed team, it's standard practice to reveal the core essence.
However, Raven simply dismissed it as unnecessary.
"Do we really need to do that? The monsters coming from the Bloodstained Castle are all seventh-rank or lower."
Her voice was full of absolute confidence.
The dwarf showed a hint of discomfort, but he didn't say anything.
Before she could say anything else.
"Oh, I forgot to mention. I'll be taking the loot from the Guardian separately. I have some research I need to do."
What kind of heartless woman is this?
Ah, no wonder she seemed normal for a mage.
'Damn it.'
As expected, things are about to get even worse.
