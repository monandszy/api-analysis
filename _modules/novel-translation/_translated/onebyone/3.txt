Chapter 3: Tutorial (2)
Barbarian.
When I first played this race, whose direct translation is “savage,” I chose the greatsword.
Because, well, it was cool.
Every man has the desire to wield a sword in both hands, spinning wildly in the heart of the enemy’s camp, swinging his sword.
‘The problem was, I died too easily.’
Intrigued by the Barbarian character, I started researching. How could I raise a Barbarian to be both powerful and durable?
I tried many things, but the Barbarian still died too easily. Even with focus on durability, they were still just berserkers.
Every battle was a tightrope walk, leading to a lack of stability.
Then, at some point, I began to doubt myself.
‘Do I have to use him as a DPS character?’
Barbarians are the race with the highest vitality among the available choices, and they also have a high Strength stat, making them able to wear Adamantium equipment.
Although not as overpowered as the Dwarves with their special abilities, they still have the basic requirements of a tank.
Well, I didn’t really want to play a Barbarian tank…
But, all that research was too much to waste. I decided to try it.
And after some trial and error, I developed a build.
‘What the hell, this is an OP character.’
Without hesitation, I abandoned my Dwarf tank.
What’s the point of a flashy fight?
I always valued efficiency, and as a gamer, I could discard personal preferences if it helped with the strategy.
Like this decision I just made.
Thump.
As I finished selecting my weapon and returned to my spot, I could feel other barbarians looking at me.
What are you looking at? Never seen a Shield Barbarian before?
I returned to my spot with the confident swagger of a Barbarian, not fazed at all.
There was no need to act this time.
“Next!”
I have no regrets about my decision.
There are three reasons.
One, shields are the most expensive to sell among the starting weapons.
Two, even if I held a blade right now, there’s a high probability I wouldn’t know how to use it properly.
Three, my ultimate goal is to be a Shield Barbarian.
Today, I made the most logical decision I could.
“Thus, you have become a warrior!”
Once I picked my weapon and returned, I finally got some time to myself.
While the other barbarians were going through their coming-of-age ceremony, I decided to analyze the situation. It was something I should have addressed much earlier…
Well, what can I do?
I was about to die if I kept thinking about it.
“You have reached the Abyss.”
Let’s organize this.
I reached the final boss room.
That was probably the trigger.
‘Wait, then what about that guy who died earlier? Did he also get to the final boss room?’
…Maybe he did.
There are many people in the world, and some are as eccentric as I am. Let’s skip this part for now.
“Tutorial complete.”
This is how I interpreted this message.
It’s telling me everything I need to know, so I can survive using this knowledge.
Whoever it is, they’re a ruthless bastard.
If they really wanted me to survive, they should have given me some background on the ‘Wraith’ or whatever it was.
I nearly died right when I arrived. You son of a bitch.
“Whew…”
Is it because I’m in the Barbarian’s body? I can’t control my emotions as well as usual.
For that reason, I’ll stop dwelling on this.
Getting too excited might ruin everything, and frankly, it’s not like me to stress over the cause.
The deed is done, and it’s irreversible.
It’s more productive to think about how to get through this going forward.
So…
Right, I’ll just think about that for now.
‘Survival.’
***
The coming-of-age ceremony is over.
Now, I’m walking through the forest.
The tribe leader is in front, and young Barbarians are behind me.
Everyone seems to be enjoying themselves, like they’re on an outing.
But I can’t laugh genuinely like they can.
Because I know their final destination.
“Halt!”
We passed through the thick bushes and arrived at a wall about 30 meters tall.
“Open the gate!”
The gate creaks open with a rough mechanical sound.
It’s so slow, it makes me want to yawn.
But the young Barbarians are mesmerized, as if they’ve forgotten how to breathe. In the strange silence, a gray city finally reveals itself beyond the gate.
“Lafdonia…”
I imagine my gaze is not too different from theirs at this moment.
Paved roads and stone structures.
A spire piercing the sky, visible among them.
I never dreamt that I would see this, something I only knew from the loading screen illustration, in reality.
Damn.
“Warriors!”
The tribe leader turned around and shouted as the gate opened.
I wondered if he wanted to say something nice before sending them off…
“Go forth! Your destiny awaits you!”
A long speech was unnecessary for Barbarians.
“WAAAAAAA!”
The Barbarians who just became adults roared and rushed into the city. Though reluctant, I joined them, shouting.
There are people sleeping peacefully inside those buildings with their lights off, but who cares?
I’m a Barbarian.
WHOOSH-!
I hear the gate closing behind me.
Of course, none of the Barbarians pay any attention.
The excited barbarians ran for a long time before finally calming down and slowing their pace. Only then could I resume my thoughts calmly.
I feel conflicting emotions right now.
“…”
Fear of the situation I’ve faced.
And a strange sense of anticipation, having become a part of the world from the game I enjoyed playing the most.
It’s a little ridiculous.
I just vowed to focus on survival, and yet these emotions arise.
…I guess I’m not normal.
Not compared to these Barbarian bastards.
“Halt!”
The leader, who was running at the front, stopped and turned around.
“I think we’ve lost our way!”
The Barbarians murmured at this shocking confession.
“Karak, the third son of Fawn, has led us astray!”
“He has no qualifications as a leader!”
“He must be held accountable!”
Bullshit. They were all following him happily.
Is this Barbarian society? It’s ruthless.
“I understand. Stop it. I will accept that I lack qualifications and step down from leadership.”
Karak, the second and third son of Fawn, hung his head and returned to the group.
The new leader was chosen—a female Barbarian.
“Ainar, the second daughter of Pnelyn!”
“A wise Ainar will lead us to the right path!”
The female Barbarian was pleased with the hopeful words and led the group at the front.
But it didn’t take long for her to follow the same path as the previous leader.
“…I think we’ve lost our way.”
Surprisingly, their words were identical, down to the last syllable.
“No way! We have to reach the Labyrinth within the allotted time!”
“Ainar has no qualifications as a leader!”
“That’s right!”
Confused, the Barbarians began to seriously discuss who to choose as the third leader.
“I think Jin, the second son of Tetran, would be good.”
“No, I don’t think so. Rather…”
Do these guys have brains?
Don’t they realize that no matter who leads, they won’t be able to reach their destination?
Maybe it’ll be my turn next.
“…”
I quietly moved to the back and approached the second leader.
She was slightly less than 2 meters tall and stood apart from the group, looking dejected.
“Bjorn, the son of Yandell? Have you come to blame me as well?”
No way.
I saw them all as the same.
I shook my head, and the female Barbarian tilted her head.
“Then why have you come? If you’re here to console me, I don’t need it.”
“No. I’ve come to show you how to find the way.”
“…Is that true? How?”
I pointed with my hand.
“Just follow them.”
“Just follow them?”
She looked completely unconvinced.
I used my patience and explained it step by step, using a logical approach.
It’s the middle of the night. All the buildings on the main road are dark. But for such a late hour, there are quite a few people walking the streets.
They’re all armed, not wearing everyday clothes.
Where are they going?
“Right, now that I think about it, it looks that way. I’ll try it.”
The female Barbarian returned to the group and shouted, “I’ve figured out the way!” The Barbarians cheered, stopping their search for a third leader.
“Ainar is the best!”
“A wise warrior!”
In any case, the group started moving again.
As time passed, more and more armed people appeared around us, confirming that we were going the right way.
We could even see a glow spreading out in all directions from a distance.
If we’ve come this far, we’ve at least avoided getting lost.
“There’s the Labyrinth! I see the Labyrinth!”
“The sacred dimension of combat!”
I continued the thought process that had been interrupted.
My biggest concern right now is whether it’s a good idea to enter the Labyrinth.
“I can feel it! The Labyrinth is calling to my soul!”
The Barbarians were ecstatic. They wouldn’t notice if I slipped out of the group quietly.
Then I wouldn’t have to enter the Labyrinth.
I wouldn’t have to fight monsters and bleed.
But I know this fact better than anyone, and yet I can’t stop thinking about it.
‘It’s probably because I know running away won’t solve anything.’
[Dungeon & Stone] has a tax system.
All city residents from the age of 20 must pay taxes, and failure to do so results in execution.
This might sound like a terrible game, but the reason becomes clear when you examine the world.
It’s not something I need to worry about just yet, but…
“Ainar! Let’s pick up the pace!”
“WOOOOO!”
Anyway, I have to earn money.
Of course, that doesn’t necessarily mean I have to enter the Labyrinth and fight monsters.
Even if I worked at a tavern, I wouldn’t have to worry about food or shelter for now.
…If only I wasn’t a Barbarian.
Barbarians are the only race that gets a weapon at the start of the game.
The reason is simple.
[Barbarian? Sorry, a person just got saved.]
[Get out of here! I don’t have anything for a Barbarian to do! What are you trying to break this time?]
Barbarians can’t do ordinary jobs.
According to the game’s setting, they can’t make a living except by fighting monsters in the Labyrinth.
Of course, the actual situation is unknown.
Maybe it’s easier to find a job than I think.
But to rely on that and leave the group, there’s one thing that’s holding me back.
“The gate closes in 10 minutes. Enter quickly!”
The Labyrinth opened once a month, in-game time.
In other words, if I don’t enter this time, I have to survive in this city for a month.
What if I can’t find a job?
What if no one wants to hire me just because I’m a Barbarian?
Well, my future is looking bleak.
I’ll be able to survive for a week on the food the tribe leader gave me, but after that, I’ll have to rely on scavenging food scraps.
Maybe I’ll starve before that.
One thing is clear: even if I survive that time, my body will be completely different from now.
“I’ll go in first!”
“No, I will!”
Hunger, cold, and unsanitary sleeping conditions.
I know better than anyone how deadly these things can be to the human body.
So, if I’m going to enter anyway, it’s more logical to do it now while I’m in top condition.
‘The problem is that this could shorten my life.’
That’s when my worries deepened.
“Bjorn, the son of Yandell!”
Someone grabbed my shoulder.
It was the female Barbarian from before.
Her name is definitely…
“Ainar, the third daughter of Pnelyn.”
“It’s the second daughter.”
Whatever, what does she want from me?
“All the other warriors have already entered the Labyrinth. Only you and I are left.”
“Ah.”
It was quiet.
When I looked around, there were few people left in the square, not even the other Barbarians. It seems Ainar came to check on me as the second leader since I was just standing there.
“We need to hurry. We’ve lost time because of our late arrival.”
I nodded and looked straight ahead.
The portal, which was emitting a blinding light from far away, was noticeably smaller now.
“The gate closes in 5 minutes!”
The guide announced the remaining time once more.
Five minutes, that’s a bit tight.
I need to make a decision soon…
“Go ahead. I’ll follow right after you.”
“Okay.”
Ainar nodded and headed toward the portal, making my worries even worse.
So, what do I do now?
As a hardcore efficiency enthusiast, I always preferred to do everything quickly.
I weighed the possibilities before taking action, always considering the next step.
If it seemed beneficial in the short term but ultimately a loss, I chose “No.”
If the opposite was true, I chose “Yes.”
That’s why I never had a choice.
“The gate is closing soon! Stand back!”
I ran forward.
Like when the tribe leader called out my name, a deep fear was welling up inside me.
No wonder, I’ve lived a sickly life, so even a simple fistfight is foreign to me.
Let alone fighting a monster?
My knees are already shaking.
“It’s dangerous!”
But if there’s no possibility at all, then what’s the point?
Right now, I have a barbarian’s body that’s ridiculously strong.
I have the knowledge gained from training thousands of characters.
Most importantly, I have a grand goal to survive.
So, I have to do it.
Even though I know, better than anyone, that this is a terrible choice with a punishing ordeal in store.
Because I’ve already decided that it’s the most logical choice—
“You have entered the Crystal Cave on the first floor.”
So I had to do it.
