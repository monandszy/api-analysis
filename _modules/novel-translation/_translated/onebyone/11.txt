Chapter 11, Second Floor (1)
[There is a possibility that they have split into two groups by now. If you see a barbarian using a one-handed hammer and shield, don’t approach recklessly and wait for support.]
The description is spreading.
It’s not detailed, but it doesn’t matter.
I don’t think there’s any other barbarian using a shield besides me.
“Mister…?”
Erwen looked up at me with worried eyes.
I could see her thoughts clearly and chuckled.
“Don’t worry. I won’t leave you behind.”
I had already decided to help Erwen.
The reason is simple.
I’ve always enjoyed helping those in trouble.
If it benefits me, of course.
“As I said before, I’ll take nine of the spoils and you get one. Understand?”
“Of course. I’ll definitely repay your kindness.”
Kindness…
“Yes, be sure to repay it.”
There’s no reason not to accept if they’re offering it. I won’t expect much, though.
“Yes, I will… .”
Seeing Erwen clench her fist with determination, I finished preparing for our move, tying my boots.
“So, what are we going to do now?”
“We’ll move through the outer area. Summon your spirit again. We’ll talk on the way.”
“Yes.”
Walking through the darkness with a fist-sized flame as a lamp, I checked a few more things.
“How long can you summon the spirit exactly?”
“If it’s just to illuminate the surroundings, I can sustain it for 10 hours.”
“How long does it take to recover?”
“I can rest for about 2 hours.”
“I see.”
The situation is much better than I thought.
If everything goes according to plan, we will escape their pursuit without any major risks.
Then I will reap the benefits of the risks I have taken this time.
“Mister.”
Erwen spoke while I was organizing my thoughts.
“Can I ask where we’re headed now?”
Ah, I didn’t tell her that.
“Second floor.”
“What…?”
Don’t look at me like that. You heard right.
“We’re going to the second floor.”
“You and I, together?”
“Yes, you and me.”
It’s not that we don’t have a choice, it’s something I’ve been thinking about from the start. On the first floor, the two of us moving together would only reduce our gains… .
But the second floor is a different story.
“I… I mean, Mister? The second floor is completely different from the first floor. You know that, right…?”
“I know.”
On the first floor, there were three or four at a time, but now there are a dozen, not to mention mutated species and even higher-level monsters.
“However, we’ll be fine if we only operate at the entrance. You and I are quite a good match.”
“Me… with you?”
I don’t know what you’re surprised about, but a melee tank and a ranged dealer are a good combination.
That was one reason I had been considering going to the upper floor with Erwen. If we go there, we can split the magic stone in half and still increase our gains significantly.
However, I had abandoned this idea because we had no means to pass through the darkness.
“I, I don’t know, even though I think about it, going to the orc’s den to avoid the goblins… .”
Well, seeing this reaction, I guess she would have rejected it immediately even if I had suggested it knowing it.
But things are completely different now.
“Is there any other way? You know they’re all over the first floor.”
Erwen now has a reason to go to the second floor, and I could use that opportunity to raise the ratio to 9:1.
Of course, this doesn’t mean that there were no emotional factors involved in this decision.
[For those who capture the elf, I will give 10,000 stones and the opportunity to enjoy first, in addition.]
I hate these kinds of guys.
No, it’s more than hate, it’s close to disgust.
But to give them a taste of their own medicine, get a bigger reward than the risks, and even feel self-satisfied about doing someone a favor?
Isn’t this the epitome of efficiency?
“I’ll give you a chance to choose. What will you do?”
“I’ll go… .”
Erwen nodded with a pained expression. I guess the message stone communication she just heard was the deciding factor… .
Perfect timing.
“Then let’s keep moving.”
“…But do you know the way to the second floor?”
“I don’t know exactly.”
“What?”
“Don’t worry. If we keep going north, we’ll eventually find it.”
It’s not wishful thinking, it’s actually true.
If you follow the darkness and go in one direction, you’ll find a portal somehow. This darkness is like a route to the upper floor.
Even though it’s a labyrinthine structure, so we’ll be lost.
It’s worth the risk.
“Goblin trap!”
As we were walking, we saw a trap.
It was much later than I thought. It should have appeared earlier.
…Could it be that goblins are rare in the places without light? Like in the game?
If so, I feel a little suffocated.
How unlucky was I to fall into the darkness from the start and immediately encounter goblins?
“I’ll take care of it! You can rest, Mister!”
Erwen stepped in front of me, seeing an opportunity to appeal to me.
“Just in case, don’t use the spirit.”
“…Of course!”
Erwen approached the trap with a look of surprise, though it seemed obvious.
And… .
“Grrr!”
The moment the goblin jumped out, she shot the arrow already attached to the string from very close range.
Puk-!
Oh, she looks like Legolas doing that.
She’s much more skilled than I expected. Her movements are very agile.
“How was that?”
Erwen looked at me with a smug smile after defeating the goblin.
“Normally, you would have used your spirit, right?”
“Yes… .”
“Well done. You’re really an elf, seeing how you shoot an arrow.”
Erwen looked happy and embarrassed. Is she that happy to be acknowledged? Honestly, I was being a little sarcastic.
Not about her skills, but her personality.
“But I’ll do the fighting from now on. You should save your arrows as much as possible.”
“No, I can just pick them up and reuse them? I don’t even need to pull them out.”
Erwen bent down, picked up the magic stone and arrow, and returned. The arrow looked perfectly intact, without any visible damage.
“…I see.”
Man, so embarrassing.
In the game, arrows were consumables that disappeared after firing one. But you could carry 1,000 at a time in one slot.
“Here you go!”
Erwen held out her small hand.
“Take this! I get one for every nine you get, right? I’ll do my best from now on! Then I can earn a little, too? I promised my brother that I would buy him something when I get back!”
Uh, a, um… .
“Yes, do your best… .”
What is this? Is she being sarcastic?
***
As we were quickly heading north, catching goblins from time to time in the darkness, a voice came out of the message stone, which had been silent for a while.
[This is an additional message. It seems that Hatz Young, who was attacked by the elf, has raised the bounty to 20,000 stones. Dead or alive.]
It means those guys are within 300 meters.
Instinctively, Erwen came closer to me.
“Don’t worry. They won’t go to the lengths of using torches to find us.”
“I hope so?”
“I’m sure.”
In fact, I’m almost certain.
While eavesdropping on their conversations through the message stone, I realized that this group was nothing more than a group of hoodlums.
They didn’t seem to be very united.
From my guess, they probably only functioned as a convenient community for themselves. In the first place, the first floor couldn’t be operated by more than five people.
[I’m thinking of moving to a different area to hunt down the Blade Wolf. Are there any takers who want to move together? No need to reply.]
[I’m tired and want to find someone to rest with. Come to the pond next to the big rock. No need to reply.]
Indeed, we heard these kinds of communications as we moved here. It seems some people don’t care if they put a bounty on me or not.
However, I didn’t relax my vigilance.
It’s not that things are going wrong, but rather that things are going too smoothly according to plan.
Damn… .
With my luck, something bad should happen by now, but it’s quiet, which makes me even more anxious.
“Mister!”
What is it?
“Over there, it’s a ghoul!”
I can’t see it? I tilted my head in confusion, and Erwen moved the flame forward.
…You really have good eyes.
Now I could see the ghoul’s form.
Rotting skin and empty eye sockets, sharp, long claws resembling claws, and a human-like body, walking on all fours.
It’s exactly the same as the illustration I saw on the loading screen.
However, the problem is… .
‘What, why is a ghoul appearing here?’
The monsters that appear on the first floor change according to the east, west, south, and north. And ghouls appear in the west.
Did I wander off and reach the boundary?
Well, that’s possible. We were heading north, but we would turn around here and there if we came to a dead end.
I’ll think about that later.
“…Will I fight alone again?”
Erwen, who was eager to fight the goblins, is clearly showing her reluctance.
Is she scared because it’s the first monster she’s encountered?
She’s definitely unique.
“I’ll lead the way. You just focus on the one in the back.”
“Yes!”
After sharing a brief strategy, I slowly moved forward.
There were three ghouls blocking the passage, all in a crouching position.
Thud.
They didn’t even flinch, even though I got quite close.
Hmm, in the game, they only attacked when you got within a certain range, is this the same here?
Thud.
As I carefully took another step forward, the three ghouls rushed at me simultaneously.
“Grrr!”
The sound they make is similar to goblins.
Is that because it’s a level 9 monster? It’s so… . lacking in personality.
“Haaa!”
Instead of retreating, I took a step forward and smashed the ghoul in the front with my hammer.
Hammer Smash.
Kwak-!
The moment one ghoul’s head was crushed, an arrow shot from behind, hitting another ghoul.
Puk!
She really loves aiming for the forehead.
After pushing the oncoming ghoul back with my shield, I finished it off with Hammer Smash, ending the battle easily.
「You have defeated a Ghoul. EXP +1」
Although the battle was over in an instant, I took a short time to reflect.
Ghouls were stronger than goblins in terms of combat strength.
They were much stronger and faster.
Well, goblins do have traps… .
But it’s the fault of the suckers who get caught.
…Of course, assuming there’s light around.
“Still, they’re much better than goblins.”
“What? Why?”
“Goblins take longer to kill.”
If you don’t lose in a frontal confrontation, hunting ghouls seems more efficient than goblins in many ways.
They don’t just lay a trap and sit there.
The fact that they don’t attack before approaching is also a big advantage.
“Next time, it would be more efficient to kill one first with an arrow.”
“Yes, that would be better.”
We briefly shared our battle plan and I picked up the magic stones that had fallen to the ground and put them in my pocket.
“Mister…?”
“What is it?”
“I, well, it’s my turn to get one now… .”
“Ah, I see.”
We continued down the passage.
***
My guess about the boundary area was right.
For a while, ghouls and goblins appeared alternately, but as we continued heading north, only goblins began to appear again.
How long had it been?
[22:47]
We were nearing the end of the third day.
We had continued heading north after resting for about 4 hours in between, and we finally found it.
One crimson line drawn on the ground.
“Oh, it’s a bloodstain? It doesn’t look like a goblin’s, I wonder who it belongs to?”
…I somehow knew who it belonged to.
So I followed it, and I found a dropped piece of bread. It continued at regular intervals.
I was convinced and continued to follow the bloodstain.
“I’ve noticed that you’ve been quiet for a while… .”
10 minutes.
“Are you mad at me?”
30 minutes.
“What? Mister?”
2 hours.
“… .”
At the end of that long journey, I finally found a discarded sandal on the ground.
I couldn’t help but curse.
“I… .”
“Damn it, are you kidding me?”
“I, I’m sorry! I don’t know what happened!”
A portal was within spitting distance.
