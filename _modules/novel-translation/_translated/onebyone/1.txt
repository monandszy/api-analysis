I couldn't even beat it on the D version, and they want me to do it in reality?
Maybe I’ll have to live here forever.
Well, even that wouldn't be easy.
=========================================
Chapter 1 Prologue
I loved video games since I was young.
The reason was simple.
I spent all my time in the hospital, so naturally, the only thing I did was play games.  As time went by, gaming became a part of my life.
But anything you do for too long gets boring.
"Ah, shit… AI judgment is real? Why are you healing that guy?"
Eventually, no matter what game I played, it wasn't as fun as it used to be.
It wasn't a genre problem, either.
AOS, RPG, FPS – all the games that came out every year felt like garbage. The stories and world-building were all the same, and the systems lacked depth.
I wanted a game with something special.
That's when I discovered [Dungeon & Stone].
Tada-dat. Click, click.
It was a single-player RPG.
An overseas indie game.
It didn't support Korean, and it used 2D pixel graphics, which are rare in this day and age.
To be honest, it wasn't my style at all.
But it was free, so I decided to give it a try.  I installed the game and before long, I was hooked.
"Wow, that priest almost got me killed."
It was a unique game in many ways.
If your character died, you had to start over from scratch.
You needed NPC companions to progress in the game, and it was a side-scrolling game with an incredibly high degree of freedom.
The skill system and the world-building were also charming, and even though the story was in English, it was interesting.
The most important thing was, the game had a certain mysterious specialness to it.
Tada-dat, tada-dadak.
At the time, I was a social service worker who had just been assigned to the subway. I started to dig into [Dungeon & Stone] seriously.
It wasn't easy.
Combat in this game wasn’t just about HP/MP.
Even with full health, one bad judgment call could wipe out a character I'd been building for three months.
"…Let’s go."
After more than two years, I still couldn't get past the middle of the game. I swallowed my pride and started looking up strategies.
I had to translate the English because there wasn’t even a Korean search for it, but even that didn’t really help.
Not many people played it, even overseas, so there wasn’t much related information and what there was was useless.
I had a much deeper understanding of the game than those who played for a couple of months and called it a bad game.
So I stopped looking up strategies.
"Up three times, left four times, down once, left twice, up six times, right four times. Avoid the trap at the end... okay."
After all, I’d spent so much time looking for a game I enjoyed, and this is what I found. I decided to see it through to the end, no matter how long it took.
And…
"Whew."
That's how I got here.
「Gate of the Abyss」
My character is standing in front of the portal that leads to the final boss room.
Of course, I won’t actually see the ending until I’ve been here a few more times. This isn’t the kind of game you beat in one try.
Even so, I can feel how nervous I am from my stiff fingertips.
"The final boss…"
To some, it might be nothing.
But it took me nine years to get here.
It’s no exaggeration to say that I spent my entire twenties playing [Dungeon & Stone].
When I was discharged from my social service obligation, when I returned to school after a long time to apply for my reinstatement, when I received a message telling me I passed my interview for the job I wanted.
I always played [Dungeon & Stone].
「Do you want to enter?」
As I maneuver my character towards the portal, a prompt pops up asking if I want to enter.
Of course, I clicked YES.
But maybe it’s because it’s the final boss room, but another message pops up that looks rather serious.
「You may not be able to return.」
「Are you sure you want to enter?」
It was an unnecessary cinematic for the player.
Like I wouldn’t enter here?
「Yes/No」
I clicked Yes, and the screen switched to the loading screen.
I focused my concentration, watching the monitor turn black.
How many patterns does this guy have? What are his attributes? It’ll definitely have an instant-kill move. Well, forget about winning on the first try, just gather as much information as possible. I might need to completely change my training style or team.
My brain was buzzing with excitement and anticipation, and all I could think about was the final boss.
That’s why I was so slow to notice.
「You have reached the abyss.」
「Tutorial Complete.」
Tutorial Complete?
Wait, why is it in Korean? Didn’t [Dungeon & Stone] only support English?
「Initiating transmission.」
I sensed something off, and then a blinding light burst out.
It was so intense, I wouldn’t have even thought it was coming from the monitor.
"Damn it! My eyes!"
Everything went white.
I had tinnitus in my ears, and a strange heat on my skin. My mind felt numb, like I’d been given anesthesia.
I was confident in my ability to handle emergencies, but this time, I couldn’t even figure out what was going on.
Flash-!
I felt the light intensify, and I lost consciousness.
And when I opened my eyes again.
I was a barbarian inside the game.
