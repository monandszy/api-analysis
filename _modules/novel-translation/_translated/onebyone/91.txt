Chapter 91: Player (3)
Five months had passed since I opened my eyes in this strange world. Counting the days spent in the labyrinth, it felt much longer. A lot had happened during that time. I had killed a person for the first time, then a monster. For survival, I had done many savage things. But was my core as a modern human still intact?
Tap, tap-tap-tap, tap, click! My pinky finger naturally hit the enter key as I finished typing in the password. Then, I realized something and flinched.
‘This is… my body?’
It wasn’t the rough and thick hand of a Barbarian. It wasn’t the body of a warrior with broad shoulders and muscles like rocks. It was the body of Lee Hansoo, 5’9” tall, average weight, with soft flesh and skin. 
The moment I realized this,
“Damn it!”
I felt the ground give way beneath me and my body was sucked somewhere. When I regained consciousness, everything was dark. This wasn’t strange because I had experienced it often in the labyrinth, but…
Click.
A switch flicked, and the surroundings lit up. Surprisingly, I was in my room. This was my room, Lee Hansoo's, where I had been playing the game before being dragged here.
‘…So, what now?’
I checked my surroundings first. The bookshelf, computer, slightly worn bed... I went out to check the kitchen-cum-living room, and the bathroom. Everything matched my memory.
‘Wait, then maybe that too…?’
I hastily opened the refrigerator door. Somehow, it was full of ice-cold canned cola. I couldn't comprehend what was going on, but I didn't think too deeply about it. How could I resist this?
Click, ssss-
The sound alone was refreshing. I could endure everything else, but how much had I missed this all this time? I quickly poured it into my mouth, afraid it would disappear before my eyes. But…
‘Damn.’
I couldn’t taste anything. There was no burning sensation that felt like my throat was being split in half. All I felt was a tasteless, odorless liquid sloshing down my throat. 
Just as I couldn't hide my disappointment,
Ding-dong.
The doorbell rang. I checked through the intercom and saw a blonde white woman. It couldn't be a religious solicitation. 
‘Who are you?’ I wanted to say in my usual tone, but I realized my mistake and spoke again.
“Who is it?”
I thought she might deduce I was a Barbarian from my tone.
‘But why does it feel so awkward?’
It was just a normal question, but it felt like I had a thorn in my throat. Soon, an answer came from the intercom.
[This is Soul Queens, the guide for the Ghostbusters. Can I come in?]
Well, I didn't know it was this kind of system. Before things got awkward, I quickly opened the door. But what was this?
“Excuse me, why are you going into the wall?”
“Oh, was this a wall? It just looked like white space to me.”
Was she talking about the space I saw earlier? This spiritual world seemed to have some mysterious rules. As I guided her towards the living room, telling her the direction, the woman exclaimed.
“Amazing. Even so, you should at least be able to see a faint form.”
“Form?”
“This place. It's probably you… ”
“Just keep calling it ‘there’."
“…If you say so.”
True to the letter that guaranteed anonymity, the woman showed no reluctance despite my indirect refusal.
“Anyway, this space is a manifestation of your imagined form. It's where your inner mind appears first. Usually, it becomes a space you feel most comfortable with psychologically.”
“So?”
“Usually, others can see it too. There are some people with strong defense mechanisms, but even then, they could at least recognize a form… ”
The woman looked at me with curiosity. It was hard to tell if it was curiosity or suspicion, but I decided to address the contradiction first.
“Then how did you ring the bell earlier? You said it wasn't visible then?”
“I guess it was expressed that way. I didn't press any bell. I just called you as soon as I arrived in this white space. Do you understand?”
Honestly, I vaguely understood, but also completely didn’t. 
So I just awkwardly smiled and nodded.
“Thanks to your kindness.”
“That's good. It's a concept even wizards find difficult to understand, so I'm always at a loss for how to explain it.”
Anyway, the woman had introduced herself as a guide, so I felt comfortable asking what I was curious about.
“Oh, but what happens if you get the password wrong?”
I had figured it out, but some people might not be able to type in the password.
“That? Nothing big. It's just a deception.  Almost nobody, like you, actually gets the password right before I come.”
“……”
“Whether you enter the password or not, I have to come and check anyway.”
By the way, she said checking was simple. 
Just look at them and you can tell?
Maybe she had a special ability, but I realized it after seeing my current appearance.
A navy-blue suit that fit perfectly. 
It was a gift from my ex-girlfriend for getting a job.
‘Is the difference in the clothes…?’
I mean, I knew she was a modern person as soon as I saw her, so she must have known the same about me.
“Wow, you're really quick.  There's a difference between a player and an NPC right from here.”
“NPC?”
“It's a slang term for locals. Anyway, the difference between the two isn’t just the clothes. You’ll see clearly when you enter this space. This is the first time I've seen someone with nothing at all… ”
“Usually, you can tell by the room.”
“Yes. NPCs don’t have posters of Rockstar in their room, right?”
I got it. 
With this kind of verification, it would be almost impossible for locals... or NPCs, to hide their identities.
“So, I pass?”
“Of course.”
I was worried because my room wasn’t visible due to my defense mechanism, but she nodded without hesitation. 
Seeing that, I realized one more thing. 
The clothes, tone, expression, and this mental space. 
There must be a definite way to distinguish NPCs besides these.
‘She must be keeping it from me for security reasons.’
“Well, now you’re officially part of the Ghostbusters too.”
“But who named it Ghostbusters?”
“There's someone.  I know, right?  It’s such a lame name. I kept telling him to change it to something else… ”
I was curious because I thought it was a very sensible name…
“Sigh, everyone who comes here complains about the name.  They all ask why I named it that.”
I awkwardly nodded.
I couldn’t agree with her sentiment that the name was lame, but I could pretend to agree. I’ve always been good at acting smart.
“It’s a… unique name, for sure.”
“Right?  Oh, where was I… ”
Soon, the woman got back to the point.
“Ah, we can’t forcibly separate souls and kill people like the NPCs who sneak in. But, we can exile them so they never get called back here, so make sure to familiarize yourself with the rules when you have time.”
Then the woman explained the basics of using the Ghostbusters community.
“Do you have a computer? If you do, go ahead. If you don’t, you'll have to imagine one and materialize it… ”
“I have one.”
“That saves time. Go ahead and turn it on.”
I turned on the computer as instructed, but instead of the familiar OS screen, a window popped up.
“Wait a moment. Your code… ”
After the woman called out the code, the window changed to a page where I could choose a nickname.
“Just create a nickname here, and you're done. Once you make it, you can't change it, so choose carefully.”
Hmm, what should I do?
As I was pondering, the woman offered some advice.
“You played Stone Iven, right? Most people use their nicknames from there. My nickname, Soul Queens, came from there too.”
Stone Iven.
The main board of the dead game community didn't even have 30 new posts a day… 
But the people who played this game would have used it at least once.
And so did I.
‘It’s not my real name, it’s my ID, so it’s okay to use my nickname from there, right?’
I typed in my nickname and hit enter. But…
[Nickname unavailable.]
“Ah, someone must be using that nickname.”
What? Someone is using that nickname?
I couldn’t understand, but for the time being, I changed one letter of the spelling and decided on a nickname. The woman smiled meaningfully at my nickname.
“Heh, you must be a fan of his.”
Fan?  What is she talking about?
Just as I was going to ask in detail, the woman continued her explanation. 
She explained how to use the community going forward.
“Well, I’ve told you pretty much everything. I’ll be going now, so feel free to use it. If you have any problems, send a 1:1 inquiry!”
Soon, the woman with the nickname Soul Queens left. 
My room, where I was alone once again. 
After completing the tutorial, I easily browsed through the community.
[For 20s and 30s males only]
[United States of America]
[Beastkin Assemble]
[Wizardry]
[Chat Room]
There were many active chat rooms. 
If I chose one of them and entered, I could chat with them? 
It was a futuristic and fantastic system.
‘There are also rooms with rank restrictions or passwords.’
Just to get used to this place, I chose a random room. 
[Newbie Room]
It wasn't a rank restriction, but a special room where only those who joined the community within a year could enter.
There might be a lot of people like me.
Click.
The moment I double-clicked.
Bright light burst out of the monitor.
Just like the day I woke up from the Barbarian's body while in the middle of the game.
When I regained consciousness, I was in an open field. 
***
Crackle, crackle-crackle-crackle.
A bonfire was blazing in the center, like a campfire.
A dozen or so people were standing near it.
They were all men.
After all, how many women play this perverted hardcore game? 
“Oh, you’re new!”
The eyes of the people around me gathered at my arrival.
White, yellow, black.
They were more diverse than I thought…
But after living in this strange world for a few months, I felt a sense of kinship with people from the same homeland first.
Was it the same for them?
“What country are you from?”
“Oh, Korea.”
“I see! Welcome!”
I looked around and checked my surroundings. 
There were no racist stares. It was an atmosphere of genuine welcome for a newcomer. 
‘What’s that above their heads? Nicknames?’
Semi-transparent letters were floating above their heads.
Then, a black man in a neat suit approached me.
“It’s a bit bare, right? We haven't collected enough points to decorate. I’m Darkman, the room leader. Would you mind revealing your nickname and introducing yourself?”
“Revealing my nickname?”
“You must be new to this room. Just think of it like that. In this community, you'll find strength in clear recognition and thought.”
Clear recognition and thought…
Is it like using an active skill?
‘Nickname reveal.’
As I murmured that in my mind, everyone’s eyes turned towards my head. 
Now they could see my nickname, too. But…
“Hello, ElfNuNa.”
The moment I revealed my nickname, thinking it was just an anonymous space.
“……”
“……”
A chilling silence enveloped the field.
And then, after a moment.
“ElfNuNa?!”
“Crazy, the one who wrote the stats guide?”
“Uh… Isn’t she a game company person?”
“So, she was Korean! I knew it!”
“Hey!  Is it really her? Is it really her?”
Somehow, there was a commotion. 
But before I could grasp the situation, I silently breathed in deeply.
‘Whew… ’
What was this?
