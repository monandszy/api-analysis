Chapter 45: The Line (2)
Returning to the lodging, I began organizing my backpack, lost in thought. The cause? This metal helmet in my hand.
“Should I sell it?”
The official in-game name of this helmet was “Golden Mask.” It was an item obtainable after defeating the boss of the “Blood-stained Citadel” and fulfilling several special conditions. Its function was simple.
It customized the wearer’s facial appearance. However, it came with the condition of only being usable for 30 days.
“It was a consumable item with a limited number of uses, too.”
I think it was a maximum of five uses? After using it all, it naturally disappeared from the inventory. Of course, I’m not sure. After all, it was an item I had never used except for the first time I obtained it. 
After that, I always sold it in the marketplace. For about 500,000 stones. 
“Hmm, but it’s still a difficult decision...”
If I were playing the game, I wouldn’t be thinking this way. Why? A cosmetic item? To make a 2D pixel character, and for only 30 days?  Even if it cost 10,000 stones, selling it would be profitable. But this place I’m in now is without a doubt reality.
After a brief contemplation, I made a decision. 
“I’ll just keep it for now, just in case. I’m not desperately short on money either.”
It’s completely different from the game. Here, I could even be falsely accused and thrown in jail.  If I ever have to turn this city into an enemy, this item would be extremely useful. Maybe I’ll have a use for it for other reasons.
“Money is king, after all.”
After ending the internal debate, the importance of money truly hit me. If I hadn’t made a lot of money this time, I would have definitely chosen to sell it. And as this shows, with money, there are more choices. Whether it’s the game, reality, or even this distant world.

“Hey, did you hear? The Crystal Alliance has disbanded!”
The silver-haired elf, Daria Whittember di Terzia, who was quietly finishing her meal in a corner of the restaurant, perked up her pointed ears.  It was because she heard a conversation about a topic that interested her.
“What? The Crystal Alliance disbanded?”
The Crystal Alliance. An adventurer clan that grew explosively over the past 10 years, based on a vast network of countless message stones, providing various conveniences for adventurers on the first floor. 
“Isn’t it surprising?  One whole adventurer clan vanished overnight?”
“Nonsense! How could they be called adventurers? When did they ever act like adventurers?”
From what she heard, most of the Crystal Alliance members were ordinary people who ventured into the realm of adventurers because they couldn’t bear the pressure of taxes. They had other jobs in the city, and they only spent one day a month in the labyrinth. Of course, there was nothing inherently wrong with that. No, on the contrary, I think it was a good intention. Many ordinary people who were facing financial ruin were saved through this. But...
“Anyway, it’s good news!  They were acting so arrogant, thinking they were adventurers.”
The current Crystal Alliance had gone bad. Not only had they started excluding outsiders as their power grew, they were also abusing their position and committing evil deeds against newcomers. Just like what happened to her sister. They had tried to do something outrageous and then tried to silence her by killing her.
“Even though I hate to admit it, if it wasn’t for that Barbarian, I can’t even imagine what might have happened.”
After hearing about that incident, she had been planning to teach them a lesson sometime. But it seems like she wouldn’t even need to do that now. Luckily, thanks to the Barbarian once again.
“By the way, I haven’t asked this yet. So why did they suddenly disband?”
“Ah, haven’t you heard that news?”
“The news?”
“The Barbarian of Freedom!”
She couldn’t help but furrow her brow as she secretly listened to the following story. It was a very interesting story. Not only did he break out of prison and clear his own name, but he even took the mayor’s daughter hostage?
“It got so big that people are saying that the law to catch looters, which was going to be applied to 9th-grade adventurers only, will be dropped because of this incident.”
It was a story that was definitely worth all the buzz. The one who falsely accused him had already been executed, and the Crystal Alliance, with its massive size, was said to have been punished for its past actions. However...
“But you know what’s even more surprising? That Barbarian is only a 9th-grade adventurer!  In other words, he just recently passed the rite of passage!”
A 9th-grade adventurer who just passed the rite of passage.  Hearing this somehow made her think of someone.  That Barbarian who had been confident in front of her, a Barbarian who stood out in many other ways. 
“Could it be... such a coincidence?”
She shook her head as if to clear her thoughts. Then she left the shop and went back to her lodging. But with every step, she kept thinking.
“Is that Barbarian really dead?”
The circumstances up until now made it seem like there was no room for doubt. But if the protagonist of the story she just heard was him...
“Then it would explain why he didn’t come back to the lodging for two days...”
Should I even tell my sister?
Click. As she opened the door with those thoughts in mind, she saw her sister, who looked noticeably gaunt. She was sitting on the bed with her eyes closed, controlling three flickering flames, which looked as if they could go out at any moment.  Even in the labyrinth, two was her limit...
“Ah, sister, you’re back?”
“... Were you summoning spirits from the moment you got back?”
“Yes, I have to if I want to widen my vessel even a little...”
Her sister’s lips tightened at those words. The training method itself wasn’t surprising. After all, it was something she had taught her. However, her sister had never pushed herself to this limit before.
“Sister, I think I heard the voice of fire too.”
“What...?”
“I finally understand. How to become stronger. Why I’ve been weak all this time. Why I’ve always had to rely on others...”
Her sister, who had always looked somewhat intimidated, met her gaze directly as she continued.
“I wasn’t desperate enough.”
Even though her voice was hoarse and lacked vitality, one thing was felt intensely. It was a venomous intent. Finally, the one thing that had been missing from her sister had been filled.  It was clear what caused the change. 
Therefore, Daria kept her mouth shut.  
“Even if that story is true... It’s better not to tell her now.”
Just like 10 years ago.  This will all be for her precious sister.

It was past noon.  I visited the Adventurer’s Guild near the Mage Tower. To be honest, after experiencing such a dreadful ordeal, I didn’t even want to go near the place for a while... but I had no choice because I had to do the quest I had been given yesterday.
“What business do you have here?”
“I’m looking for suitable companions.”
“Do you have any preferences?”
The guild clerk, who had no time for unnecessary chatter, got straight to the point. I answered without hesitation.
“I want a team of at least four people who have been active on the third floor or higher.”
Since I’m already at this point, I don’t want to just fill Einar’s spot and end it there. On the contrary, I plan to use my promotion to 7th-grade adventurer to join a truly skilled team and efficiently conquer the tower.  
“Well, that’s assuming I find a good team.” 
I presented my prepared profile sheet and identity badge according to the procedure, causing the drowsy clerk to flinch. Then he checked it several times with a strange look in his eye.
“... Five stars?”
“Is there a problem?”
“N, no!  Not at all!”
The clerk seemed to have been jolted awake. I’m not sure what the stars mean, but his tone seemed to have become friendlier.  
“Here’s a list of teams that meet your requirements, Sir Bjorn Jandel. Would you like to take a look?”
The process was completed in less than five minutes.
“Quite a few, huh?”
“I, I swear! That’s all the recruitment postings on file that meet your requirements!”
Who cares what he says? I just said that. I don’t understand why he has to swear on it.
“Hmm.”
The guild clerk provided a document with brief descriptions of a total of fifteen teams. Let’s start by reading the first one.
[3rd Floor Exploration - Ellen Bornef]
Preferred Exploration Area: Twilight Slope, Iron Rock Hill, Black Estuary
Average Rank: 7th Grade
Current Members: 2 human warriors (7th grade) specializing in close combat, 1 beastman warrior (7th grade) specializing in close combat, 1 dwarf warrior (7th grade) specializing in close combat.
Recruiting: 1 warrior specializing in close combat.
*Equal Distribution
*Elves not welcome
*Mandatory participation in post-exploration gatherings
*Alcohol consumption allowed during exploration if desired
What the hell is this team?  I’m already sweating just reading the words. 
I read the recruitment notices for the other teams, but I couldn’t find anything that appealed to me. If the members were good, the share was low, and if the share was good, there was something wrong with the team’s composition. 
“...If it’s this bad in the notice, then it must be even worse in reality.”
If my experience was a little more extensive, finding a team would have been easier. The fact that my highest level reached was the 2nd floor. If I wasn’t a complete newbie, I would have had a lot more options.  Teams wouldn’t be trying to rip me off so blatantly with a low share either. 
“This is a pain.”
Ideally, I’d rather just post a recruitment notice myself and form a team... but no one would come. If anyone did come, they wouldn’t be normal.
“I didn’t think I’d be able to find one in a day anyway.”
“Have you found a team you’d like?”
“Nothing caught my eye today.”
I shook my head and handed back the document, and the clerk spoke like an NPC.
“Oh, is that so? I’m sorry I couldn’t be of any help.  If you’d like, I can make Sir Bjorn Jandel’s information accessible to other teams—”
“That’s not necessary, I’ll come back next time.”
“Ah, is that so? I’m always friendly to adventurers. I’m Terbes.”
He was definitely friendly, in terms of his voice, tone, and actions. His work performance was also impeccable. 
“Farewell, adventurer!”
But... why does it feel so strange?
***
Leaving the Adventurer’s Guild with an inexplicable sense of unease, I was returning to the lodging when I stopped at a corner of the alleyway.  It was because of a Barbarian. 
Thud. A thick beard. Ragged trousers covered in dirt and grime. Barbarians as a race tend to dress like beggars, but even considering that, the Barbarian was in a truly miserable state, leaning against the wall of the alleyway.
“What the...?”
I felt an unsettling sense of unease the moment I saw him.  Even though I didn’t share the same lodging, I often hung out with Barbarians, so I could tell.  It’s one thing to just rest anywhere you please, but...
“Why... doesn’t he have a weapon?”
No weapon.  This was a serious contradiction.  No matter how poor, hungry, or cold they were, Barbarians always carried a weapon as if it were their own life. I usually ignored most of my curiosity, but I was instinctively drawn to him and spoke. But what is this?
“Hey.”
“...  Hick, hi-yi-i-k!”
The Barbarian, who had been dozing off leaning against the wall, was startled by the sight of me.  Well, it’s a natural reaction for any creature to be afraid of a stranger... but that’s for other creatures. Our brave Barbarians don’t do that.
“Damn, could this guy be...?”
The formless unease begins to take shape. My heart sank, but I quickly composed myself and organized what I had to do in my head. Okay, first I need to ease his guard.
“Don’t be scared, I won’t hurt you.”
As proof that I wasn’t the enemy, I took out jerky from my backpack and forcefully put it in his hand. It’s the greatest courtesy a Barbarian can offer.  Of course, he only received it, and didn’t eat it in front of me. However, I could clearly feel that the wariness in his eyes had softened a bit.  
“Well, that’s enough for a conversation.”
I asked as I’d been waiting for.
“Why are you doing this here?”
“Th, that’s, uh... I don’t have any money...”
I nodded silently. A Barbarian being short of money in the early stages. It’s possible. No, thinking about it, it’s natural. But...
“What about your weapon?”
“I, I sold it...”
Not only did he sell his weapon, but he was also speaking formally...
“Let’s introduce ourselves. I’m Bjorn, son of Jandel.”
“Ri, Riyen’s son, Ta, Tarican!”
He seemed to realize his mistake later, and raised his voice, but it was too late. I’ve already figured it out. 
“Nice to meet you! Tarican, son of Riyen!”
This guy, he’s a fiend.  And a recent arrival to this world.
