Chapter 61: Survival Rules (4)
Day 7, Afternoon. 
That means, it’s been over 80 hours since I was separated from the dwarf horde and stranded in this damned forest.
“... ”
I’m still here.
I blankly gaze at the increasingly severe, terrible auditory and visual hallucinations, silently wandering through the woods.
This is a change that occurred after the first day of being stranded.
“... ”
I’ve stopped speaking, except for when it’s absolutely necessary.
It’s not because we’ve had a falling out or anything like that.
It’s just that I don’t have the strength left.
Oh, there’s one more change. 
“... ”
I connected Misha and myself with a rope.
It looks like a mullet tied to a rope.
It’s a technique I naturally learned after spending so much time in the Witch’s Forest.
This way, if either of us lags behind or gets separated, we can use the rope to find each other.
“Bjorn… go a little slower, please…  ”
“Alright.”
I slowed down.
This morning, Misha’s condition rapidly worsened.
She’s not sick or seriously injured.
She’s simply reached her physical limit.
Thud, thud.
I’ve slowed my pace, but I keep feeling something dragging at my waist.
Is she unable to keep up even at this speed?
After briefly considering it, I stopped.
“Get on my back.”
“...?”
“You’ll feel better if you just rest your eyes for a bit.”
“But… ”
Misha looks at me hesitantly.
I guess it’s funny, though.
To be honest, if you only look at appearances, I’m in much worse shape than her.
‘I’ve never seen a beggar this bad off.’
The cotton clothing I’m wearing under my armor is riddled with holes and tears, and my iron equipment shows signs of corrosion all over.
It’s all side effects from activating Misha’s abilities.
The ‘Corpse Golem’s passive skills activated after I unsealed it by removing the Frost Spirit Ring.
And it’s commonplace to sustain minor injuries when fighting monsters, which results in the current state of my armor due to the acidic blood splattering everywhere.
‘The repair costs alone are going to be astronomical.’
I smiled wryly.
The Litium-made breastplate and shield, being Tier 2 materials, are still in decent condition, but they’ve long since lost the pristine brilliance they once had.
Did she misunderstand seeing me smile, though?
Misha opens her mouth with concern.
“I, I’m okay. You should rest. I’ll carry you!”
Thanks for the offer, but…
Is that realistically possible?
“Alright, come here.”
I refuse to argue further and lift Misha up by her waist.
I feel her weightlessness, as well as her lack of strength.
She’s completely out of energy.
“If something happens, I’ll wake you up. Rest as much as you can until then.”
“But… ”
“Ugh.”
“... Thanks.”
Finally, Misha, who is slung over my shoulder, complies with the situation.
But I doubt she’ll fall asleep right away.
She speaks to me in a small voice.
“Bjorn.”
“Why are you calling me?”
“... Don’t you… ”
“Just say it.”
“Ugh, it smells so… good.”
Smells good, so what?
You need to finish what you’re saying.
I’m suddenly curious about the rest of her sentence, but…
Well, maybe she’s dreaming.
There’s no way a body covered in blood and sweat, that hasn’t been washed in days, would smell good.
I unconsciously smile as I hear the sound of her light breathing getting closer.
Heh.
That’s right, it was all because you guys were full.
No matter how many hallucinations I see or hear, I’ll fall asleep anywhere if I’m really tired.
That’s how our bodies are designed.
You have to survive in any environment, right?
‘Well, should we keep going?’
I continued walking through the forest with Misha on my back.
I really want to put her down and rest with her, but…
I can’t.
[84 hours have passed since you entered the Witch’s Forest.]
[Field Effect - The Witch’s Forest is strengthened.]
[Status Ailment [Witch’s Eyes] is upgraded to Stage 5.]
Field Debuff [Witch’s Eyes].
This is the real reason why the Witch’s Forest is recognized only as an area to pass through.
The effect is simple.
If you stay in one place for a certain amount of time, a 7th-tier monster, ‘Canivaro,’ will inevitably appear. The ‘certain amount of time’ decreases as the stage is upgraded.
The first day was about an hour.
And now…
‘It’s probably about 10 minutes.’
It’s practically impossible to stop moving.
And the problem is that we’re two people.
Even if Canivaro appears, there’s no comrade to help us. We’re practically dead the moment it shows up.
Even when I was at full health, it took over 15 minutes to kill it.
Theoretically, another one would appear before we could even kill one.
Thud, thud.
That’s why I’m walking now.
I feel like I’m going to die from exhaustion, but I have to keep walking.
If I don’t, I might actually die.
‘If they haven’t appeared yet, maybe we can stop worrying about them?’
It’s best to think about other things when you’re struggling.
I finished one train of thought and started another.
It’s been four days since I was stranded in the Witch’s Forest.
If Elisa had any way to find us, she should have already done so.
It seems like we can start to relax now.
‘That’s one major worry off my mind.’
I don’t know why they couldn’t find us.
But judging from the current situation…
Something happened over there.
Just like how I’m stranded here with Misha right now.
Life is a bitch because you never know what’s going to happen when.
Anyway, how long have I been wandering around, dodging those low-level mobs?
Hmm, it must have been at least an hour.
[Oppa, why are you just leaving her alone?]
I raise my head at the familiar auditory hallucination.
[You’ve fulfilled your lifelong dream, so… she’ll fall for you in a heartbeat if you just seduce her a bit, Oppa.]
A woman appears next to the tree, looking at me intently.
A white blouse and a skirt suit.
And her characteristically arrogant and prickly tone.
…My ex-girlfriend.
[Maybe she’s scared of being abandoned again?]
Ugh, damn… 
Most of the hallucinations have shown their unnatural origins until now, but this one doesn’t even try to hide it.
I feel like I could touch her and feel her body temperature.
[Oh my, you’re so cunning.]
What is she talking about, again?
She’s based on my memories, so even her actions are the same as hers.
Hmm, does this mean all the auditory hallucinations I’ve heard until now were based on my subconscious?
[That’s the problem with you, Oppa. You always try to know everything.]
‘I’ll admit that.’
The fear of ignorance is an instinct that all living things possess.
[But don’t you think it’s a bit much? You don’t try to tell me anything, even though you don’t know anything about me.]
‘You were the same, though.’
[What? What don’t you know about me, Oppa? You know me better than I do myself, from head to toe?]
My gaze involuntarily shifts at her flirtatious voice.
There was one change in the visual aspect.
“... ”
A white blouse and a short skirt suit.
It’s the same as before, but she’s wearing black stockings on her long legs.
They were skin-colored before.
[You have the same taste.]
Damn it, is this really me?
[Leave that animal girl and come here. You should just stay with me, Oppa. No one else can understand you.]
Oh, is that right?
I find myself moving forward without realizing it.
That’s when it happens.
[Make me feel—]
My ex-girlfriend’s face, which had been smiling widely, as if to embrace everything, contorted grotesquely.
Not a metaphor, literally.
Splat!
A fist slams into her face, pulverizing her facial muscles like mochi.
For some reason, Misha, who should be on my shoulder, is pummeling my ex-girlfriend in the face.
With her agility, she delivers blow after blow.
Thwack! Thwack! Thwack! Thwack! Thwack!
What? Is this a hallucination too?
I just blankly watch the scene unfold, as if I’m dreaming.
Except…
[Aaahhhhh!!!]
The screeching sound that follows jolts me awake.
Somehow, Misha, who just mashed my ex-girlfriend’s face, has come back and is shaking me by the waist.
“Are you okay! Bjorn!”
She looks like she’s about to cry, though she’s angry.
I reply briefly.
“It was the most likely solution.”
There were no other options.
And now Misha’s job isn’t to scold or worry about me.
“Now that you understand, will you hand over some potions?”
I give the order nonchalantly, sprawled on the ground with my feet in tatters, and Misha’s eyes glaze over.
But she seems to have understood my request, and she pours the potions with shaking hands.
Hiss, hiss, hiss.
A high-level potion, which costs a whopping 200,000 stones per bottle.
It’s worth its price, as it can even heal limb severance injuries.
It’s an essential consumable item.
But Misha still looks worried.
“If, if you get injured like this, even potions won’t be able to heal everything… ”
Well, that’s not true.
[Your character’s regenerative abilities have greatly increased due to the [Immortal] effect.]
Immortal Seal.
A high natural regeneration rate thanks to the Vampire Essence.
And the active skill [Immortal] as well.
If we’re talking in terms of a game, my natural regeneration stats would already be well over 150.
Even without high-level potions, I could heal from limb severance injuries as long as I had enough time.
I wouldn’t have done something that crazy if it wasn’t for this.
“What, what! I, it’s impossible to heal this quickly… ”
Misha is astonished to see me heal rapidly, with the effects of the potion on top of my own regeneration.
Well, it’s understandable, since she thinks I only have the Corpse Golem Essence.
Within a minute, my mangled legs have healed.
Unfortunately, I was barefoot.
‘Should I have taken off my shoes and run? I could have sold them for 150,000 stones.’
High-level potions and boots.
It’s a huge loss of money, considering it was an investment for killing one 7th-tier monster.
But there’s no point in regretting it now.
I open my backpack, put on the leather boots I was wearing before, and slowly rise from my position.
Okay, my toes feel normal again.
“Bjorn, what in the world! You’re not even in pain after drinking the potion…!”
“It’s the willpower of a Barbarian.”
That part is true.
Einar didn’t even wince when he drank potions.
I just have a lot of pain resistance.
Well, as long as the results are the same, that’s all that matters.
I slowly rise from my position.
