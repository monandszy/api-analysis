Chapter 15: Return (2)
“Percy? Percy!”
The leader called out someone’s name urgently.
Of course, there was no answer.
The instruction I had given Erwen was to kill the crossbowman first, no matter what.
“What in the world did you do?”
The leader finally asked me.
But even while asking, he was on guard, looking behind him instead of at me.
This was a big mistake.
I hate it when people ask questions with answers already in mind.
And I hate it a lot.
Smash!
The leader’s gaze briefly turned to the bushes.
I didn’t hesitate, dashing forward and swinging my shield.
Whoong!
Sadly, I couldn’t feel the impact.
To dodge that, he must be a real expert. If it had been a goblin, it would have become a thing of the past, bathed in the light of the world.
“Ilis! Now!”
As the leader called out, the samurai dashed towards me and swung his sword with a graceful move.
Cak!
A spark flew off the shield.
What the heck was that impact? I almost dropped the shield.
However, apart from being surprised, I charged towards the three.
This was to distract their attention and give Erwen a better chance.
But…
Whoong!
Another smash missed its target.
Are they explorers from the second floor, for real?
Facing them, the short reach of the shield was annoying for the first time.
But the more I thought about it, the more I closed the distance and aggressively swung the shield.
At that moment, the sound I was waiting for came.
Whiiiieeeet!
Finally, Erwen’s supporting fire began.
However, the arrows didn’t hit the forehead, the neck, the legs, or the arms. It was blocked by the tall guy with the sword and shield.
“I’ll handle the arrows! Focus on the Barbarian!”
I knew it. He wasn’t coming alone.
Did he decide to specialize in arrows?
Humans are really more complicated than goblins.
Bang!
Just as I was receiving the samurai’s strike with my shield, the leader slyly swung his sword, aiming for my left arm.
Serk-!
Fortunately, I reacted in time and it wasn’t a deep cut.
It was a cut, but it didn’t matter much because my arm was already damaged, and the poison was spreading, so it didn’t hurt much.
“Damn, this is a monster… ”
The leader muttered, looking at me, unfazed even after being cut.
You goddamn fool, where is my fault? It’s you who’re not good enough.
Cursing inwardly, I pushed the shield away and knocked back the samurai with force.
Then, supporting fire was unleashed again.
Whiiiiieeeet!
He must have changed his position, because it was from a completely different direction than before, but the tall guy was no pushover.
Tak!
The tall guy blocked the arrow with the shield once again.
Is he some kind of outfielder? He purposely blocks arrows even when they’re aimed at someone else, putting his own body in danger.
As the situation was not progressing easily, my frustration started to boil.
Flarrrk!
The shield, full of arrows like a hedgehog, quickly burst into flames.
“Damn!”
Unable to bear the heat, the tall guy threw the shield away with his own hand.
Sorry, our archer is a spirit archer.
You should have used a solid iron shield like mine, you poor bastard!
Whiiiiieeeet!
With the annoying shield gone, Erwen fired arrows again without hesitation.
“Aaargh!”
The arrow hit the tall guy’s shoulder.
He soon dropped his sword, becoming a useless piece of garbage.
“Ilis! I’ll take care of the fairy!”
Finally realizing the situation, the leader left me to the samurai and ran into the bushes.
It was already too late to catch him.
Damn…
I’ll just have to trust Erwen.
“Give it up, Barbarian.”
The samurai stepped back and spoke majestically.
That’s why humans are annoying.
What a fake move! It’s obvious he wants to buy time until the leader comes.
Tadat!
The samurai’s expression turned sour as I charged forward and used the smash.
“Why are you so scared alone?”
“I’m not alone!”
I asked the samurai, but the tall guy answered, getting up.
He was holding a one-handed sword in his left hand, the one he had dropped earlier.
But…
Whoong!
Maybe it’s because he’s right-handed, but his swordsmanship was terrible.
He handled the shield so well, why is he so clumsy with this?
Puck!
I retreated one step, neatly dodging the tall guy’s attack, and slammed my foot into his knee.
The tall guy let out a shriek, his face contorted with pain.
“Aaargh!”
I didn’t know it would break like that.
He fell to the ground, grabbing the area where his knee bone had popped out with both hands.
I was about to finish him off while I had the chance, but unfortunately, it was ruined thanks to the samurai.
Cak!
I blocked it several times, but I still couldn’t get used to its heaviness.
Why is this guy with these pathetic fools?
Does he have a story?
I don’t know, but it will be the biggest mistake of his life.
Whoong!
The samurai skillfully dodged my smash, putting distance between us.
Immediately, I dropped my shield, dashed forward again, and reached out my hand.
It’s called… the smash-pretend-to-be-a-smash-and-reach-out.
I’m too tired to come up with names now. It’s not even fun anymore.
“Gah!”
The samurai’s face was full of shock as I grabbed his neck.
“Didn’t see that coming, did you?”
I pulled the samurai towards me with all my strength.
Then, instead of using my useless left arm, I bit down on the samurai’s neck—
Trdrrdck-!
and ripped it off.
“Ah, ah, aaa… ”
The samurai couldn’t even scream.
With a dazed look, he held his bleeding neck with both hands, stumbling back…
Then he fell to the ground with a thud.
“Uncle!”
Did he handle that alone too?
As soon as the battle ended, Erwen emerged from the bushes, panting.
“Un… cle?”
I spat out the chunk of flesh in my mouth and wiped it with my arm.
Damn, it’s so bloody.
***
The tough battle was finally over.
Or was it just my feeling?
Erwen was fine, just like when we parted, because he didn’t have to engage in close combat.
Compared to him, I was completely a rag doll.
“Uncle! Drink this quickly.”
Erwen offered me a potion as I collapsed to my knees, my tension finally releasing.
Gulpp, gulpp, gulpp…
I cautiously finished the potion, feeling like I was drinking poison.
Poison is poison, but since it wasn’t concentrated in one area, it was better to drink it, according to Erwen.
Anyway, was it because I drank a whole bottle?
It felt completely different than usual.
“Krkrkrk.”
Something boiled up in my stomach.
I felt a sharp pain as if tiny chestnuts were bouncing around my veins, and my skin was so itchy that I wanted to go insane.
That continued for over 10 minutes.
“…Uncle, hang in there.”
Erwen wiped my body, which was covered in sweat, with the handkerchief.
Was it because of the poison, or was it just because I was dirty?
I don’t know, but the white handkerchief was completely black.
… I’ll buy a new one later.
“It’s fine now. I’m, okay.”
I finally got up, feeling a bit better.
Looking down at myself, I saw scabs forming over all the big and small injuries from being cut and stabbed.
If I drank another potion, this would disappear, but I decided not to.
“This place must be a cursed land… ”
What if I have scars, I’m a Barbarian.
“Water.”
“Yes, yes! Here you go.”
As soon as I said a word, Erwen quickly dug through his bag and took out a water flask.
I felt like a master.
Gulpp gulpp, I drank the whole bottle, and I felt my energy gradually returning.
Was water always this good?
The blood vessels that were protruding all over my body had also subsided.
“Get me the watch.”
With Erwen’s help, I checked the time.
And I froze.
[23:20]
Damn, they don’t even give me a chance to rest.
There are only 40 minutes left until day 7 ends.
If I don’t reach the first floor by then, I have to stay in this goddamn place for another three days.
“Erwen, take off their clothes.”
“Yes, yes?”
No, not you, them.
I pointed at the bodies, too exhausted to say anything, and Erwen unfastened the collar he was fastening.
“No, leave the clothes. We’re out of time, so I’ll just take their equipment, the magic stone pouch, and the backpack.”
“Yes, yes!”
Erwen moved quickly, knowing we were short on time.
“Oh, I’ll also get the red-haired man’s stuff and the crossbow man’s stuff!”
Yeah, be careful not to step on any traps.
While Erwen was away, I took off the samurai’s and the tall guy’s equipment.
I threw away the chest protector, the samurai’s sword, and the wooden shield that was burned to ashes…
After sorting out the equipment, I took a rough look at them and looted only the ones that looked expensive.
I stuffed them into the backpack as much as I could when Erwen came back.
“Ugh… ”
He looks quite burdened with two backpacks on his back.
But I’m sorry, I have three, so I can’t help you.
I quickly checked the time again.
[23:35]
Only 25 minutes left.
“Let’s go.”
“Are you sure? You look exhausted… ”
“Don’t worry about it.”
Erwen was full of concern, but he nodded after seeing my expression and cleared the way.
And so, a forced marathon began.
“I’ll follow you somehow, so open the way as fast as you can.”
“Yes.”
I sent Erwen ahead and kept running, adjusting my pace.
My body feels heavy, probably because of the mental fatigue.
Or maybe it’s just because of these backpacks?
… But I can’t leave them behind. I went through all that hardship, so I have to get some reward. Isn’t that a just world?
“Hoo, hoo, hoo… ”
How long had it been?
I could see the portal in the distance.
Erwen, who had arrived first, was waiting for me in front of it.
His expression, full of encouragement and concern, looked like a heroine from a youth manga.
Damn, it feels like I’m going to be left alone.
Feeling a little uneasy, I pushed myself to the limit and increased my pace.
Then…
“I’m going in first!”
“Wait, I, I too!”
Unlike manga, this is reality. There’s no time for emotional embraces, so I bravely entered the portal.
Brrrt-!
The light that burst out was the same as usual.
But somehow, it felt like the light was embracing me.
***
Returning to the first floor felt no different than entering the second floor.
It felt like I was being thrown out of the belly of something.
“Aaaah!”
Sadly, the result was also the same.
Or worse?
Thud-!
I was thrown off like I was grabbed by the hair and flung away, while Erwen landed safely again.
… How is that even possible?
When I was thrown to the second floor, I at least flew up and drew an arc in the air. But this time, it was like a fastball in baseball.
Damn, my bones ache.
“This is fun!”
Yeah, I bet.
If I were next to someone like me, I’d laugh too.
“Hoo… ”
I got up from my seat, loosening my stiff body, and brushed off the dust.
And I checked the time.
[23:58]
It was a close call.
I don’t want to say I was lucky.
Then I’ll have too many reasons to blame the sky.
If things go well, it’s because of me. If things don’t go well, it’s because I failed.
That’s a healthy way to live.
“You’ve worked hard, Uncle.”
“Yeah, you too.”
We exchanged farewells, looking at each other for a moment.
Wait, I feel like I forgot something…
“Loot distribution!”
“Ah, right! Essence!”
We both shouted as if we had thought of it at the same time.
“Essence?”
“Yes! You said you’d promise me something earlier!”
Oh, right, that too.
Now I remembered what I had forgotten.
But there’s no time for a long conversation.
I quickly checked the time again.
[23:59]
There were about 15 seconds left on the second hand.
I quickly closed the watch and looked up at Erwen.
So, what, what… was your name again?
Black something, I think…
“Black Whale! Meet at the Black Whale Tavern!”
“Yes!”
Erwen nodded in response to my urgent shout.
Now, I can finally rest easy—
“The labyrinth is now closed.”
“The character will be moved to Raphdonia.”
Damn, I didn’t tell you the time.
