Episode 5 Give and Take (1)
Looking back, I was a really funny human.
Even though I always thought life was boring, I never once thought about killing myself.
The feeling of boredom was ultimately just a feeling, and for me, my life was the most precious thing.
It didn't make sense in many ways.
That thought still remains.
Therefore…….
***
I'm crawling through the darkness on three limbs.
You might think it's crazy, but it's literally true.
Currently, I'm dragging my completely mangled right foot behind me, crawling on the ground on three limbs.
If anyone saw me now, they would surely imagine a stray dog with a broken leg.
How do I know?
"Because that's what I'm thinking right now."
The price of giving up human dignity was sweet.
First of all, I don't have to use my injured foot, so it doesn't hurt, and my movement speed is actually faster than before.
Most importantly, I won't step on any traps.
On the other hand, my elbows and knees are sore, but that's nothing…….
I can endure it. I can handle it.
What can't I do for survival?
I can eat shit with a smile.
Well… if you give me time to prepare, it's definitely possible.
'But what happened to that old man?'
"Old man" is just a term I came up with.
I don't know his gender, age, or name.
I'm just guessing based on his tone.
He probably looked like a 30-year-old white man with glasses.
Or maybe not.
「[Bleeding] is continuing.」
Anyway, what happened to that person who woke up in the body of Kadua's son, Orem? Did he die? Or did he wake up back in his original body?
It's a question I've been carrying ever since I opened my eyes.
Even if I try not to think about it intentionally, the more screwed up the situation gets, the more I think about that old man.
「[Bleeding] is continuing.」
I can understand why humans believe in religion.
Reality is too tough to face alone.
When despair strikes, you need somewhere to look. Just like me right now.
「[Bleeding] is continuing.」
「[Bleeding] is continuing.」
「Warning: Character's health is below 5%. If not treated promptly, the character may die.」
Whew, I've been crawling while spacing out, so I've come quite a distance.
It's a subtle difference, but I can feel the surroundings getting brighter.
It's a positive situation in many ways.
At least I'm heading in the right direction, and my hypothesis that the entire first floor wouldn't be this dark was correct.
Let's just get to the bright place somehow.
There will be people there. I'll ask for help while giving them this magic stone. Then somehow…….
'Damn, that's funny.'
I'm trying to convince myself with positive words while giving myself a carrot, but another part of me appeared.
'Hey, you idiot, they're busy, why the hell would they help you for a measly piece of bread. They'll probably steal your magic stone and shield and kill you if anything.'
Is it because of me?
This guy is smart.
'You idiot, what are you going to do then? You gotta go anyway. At least you can see in there. It's better than fighting a goblin here, right?'
'…That's true.'
My other self agreed and my mind was quiet again.
I continued to crawl.
"Khrrghh…."
I'm going crazy.
Or maybe I'm already crazy.
Well, it's natural considering I've bled this much, right?
I keep splitting into two selves, merging back together, and getting numb repeatedly.
It's a kind of virtuous cycle.
If I get any more numb, I'm sure I won't open my eyes again.
"Hrrghh…."
I laughed out loud.
I didn't even have the energy, but I laughed anyway.
At some point, the surroundings became bright.
I could see the crystals shining brightly at the end of the passage in the distance.
Most importantly, I could see the silhouette of a person standing in front of it, bathed in backlighting.
It wasn't a goblin.
It was definitely a human silhouette.
"He…lp…."
I want to yell something, but my voice won't come out.
I desperately crawled forward and closed my eyes and opened them again.
And guess what?
The human silhouette got closer. Like it teleported.
I was surprised, so I closed my eyes and opened them again.
「[Bleeding] is continuing.」
This time it was closer.
There were about five or six people standing in front of me.
I'm not seeing things, am I? I closed my eyes and opened them again.
「Achievement Unlocked」
Condition: Health drops below 2%.
Reward: Mental stat permanently increases by +1.
Then, a blond man with bent knees came into view.
Our eyes met up close, but he just stared at me and the surroundings with a curious look, without asking anything.
He's a veteran, so he quickly comes to conclusions.
"A beginner."
Damn it, then help me, you bastard.
As you can see, I'm just a trash barbarian with a shield, and the only thing I have besides that is a goblin magic stone that I traded for one of my legs.
I'll give you everything if you want. So…….
"Suspicious. How did a beginner get here faster than us?"
I quickly opened my mouth. But all that came out was a sound similar to phlegm bubbling up.
"Gr-gr-gr…."
No, honestly, it sounded more like a goblin's sound, but…….
It was enough to let them know I couldn't answer.
The blonde asked his companion.
"Ersi'na, the priestess. Could you possibly heal this fellow?"
Priestess? You mean there's a priestess in the party?
I looked over with the eyes of a reborn being who had encountered a miracle. And there was indeed a red-haired priestess in a white robe.
The priestess met my eyes and said clearly with her beautiful lips.
"I decline."
What? What did you say?
"I see. As you wish."
Why are you agreeing?
I felt heartbroken. Damn it, I don't know why I was dragged here and treated like this.
As anger surged within me, that's when it happened.
"Fatzlan, give him a potion."
"In case he can't use divine power?"
"We have plenty anyway. You'll get paid for it separately."
"Tsk."
Only then did a man with a sword on his waist click his tongue and pull a potion out of his bag and threw it.
My heart sank as it looked like my lifeline.
Thud.
Thankfully, the blonde caught the potion properly.
"It's not divine power, so it will hurt a bit."
The blonde opened the cap, sprayed half of it on the wound, and poured the other half directly into my mouth.
Soon, unbearable pain set in.
Is this the kind of pain you feel when the pain that had been building up in your body without your knowledge all at once?
「[Healing (in progress)] effect is rapidly regenerating the body.」
It feels like my whole body is melting away.
This was the reason why potions couldn't be used in combat in the game.
I thought they just blocked it in the system, but it turns out it was a really good reflection of reality.
Damn.
"Huff, huff, huff…."
After a few minutes, the pain subsided and I regained consciousness.
"Now then, barbarian, tell us. How did you reach this place before us, being a beginner? If you know of a new passage, we'd like to buy the information."
So that was the goal after all.
I don't feel bad. In fact, I'm relieved knowing they treated me well because they had a purpose.
There's nothing more ominous than unprovoked kindness.
Still, I feel a little sorry.
I don't know any secret passages.
“…I was here as soon as I entered the maze."
I honestly told them what happened.
The blonde tilted his head, then nodded as if he understood.
"Indeed. I've read about it in books. There are cases where dimensional instability causes this to happen."
My heart skipped a beat.
I asked as if I couldn't believe what I heard.
"You… never seen this before…?"
I couldn't believe it.
Well, this party has a priestess and a mage. It means they're proper guys who operate at least the middle floors.
But they've never seen this before?
"Yeah, they say it happens once every 100 years. Being dropped this far into the outer region is…"
Oh, so it's something that happens once in a hundred years. And I encountered it the moment I entered the maze.
Now I understand why other barbarians didn't carry torches.
Don't people worry about getting struck by lightning just because it's raining?
"It looks like you're a first-timer, but to experience such a rare event, it must have been a disaster."
The blonde looked at me with pity.
"It wasn't the information I wanted, but it was a fascinating story nonetheless. Don't worry about the potion, go on ahead."
He's kind of a jerk, but he seems like a good guy basically.
"Oh, and take the shield you dropped over there."
The blonde pointed to a shield lying on the ground. It was about 20 meters away. I'd strapped it to my waist properly, but it must have slipped.
"Well, we'll be on our way then."
They left before I could thank them.
Time is money in the maze, so I can't blame them.
No, it's a miracle they even spent this much time on me in the first place.
I looked at the place where they left for a while, then quickly ran to pick up the shield lying on the ground.
It's definitely a happy event that I survived…….
But I still feel a little weird.

"That barbarian was lucky."
"Well, it's a bit ambiguous to say he was lucky. He experienced something like that on his first trip... ."
The blonde smiled ambiguously and replied, and the male swordsman snorted.
"If he's the kind of guy who steps on goblin traps, he would have ended up the same way even if it wasn't for this. He was lucky to meet us in the first place."
"To be precise, it wasn't us, it was the drow. You were reluctant to even use a potion, weren't you?"
The female archer interjected as she listened quietly, and the male swordsman shrugged.
"Well, those guys are everywhere. They won't survive long anyway. Our priestess probably thought the same way, right?"
The priestess smiled wryly and didn't answer, and instead, the female archer shot back.
"Even Ersi'na would have healed him if it weren't for the temple rules. Or, if there had been no potion, she might have broken the rules herself. You think everyone is like you?"
"Well, who knows. I've seen so many people who are different on the inside and outside."
“…Fatzlan, you need to learn a little from the drow."
"Like, for example, the considerate gesture of asking if we knew the secret passage?"
"Yes. I've heard that barbarians don't welcome help from others. That's probably why he was so considerate."
“…Hey, you're praising me a bit too much, aren't you?”
The blonde scratched his head awkwardly as the conversation turned to him.
But he didn't deny the word "consideration."
"Ah, to take the shortcut, we have to turn here."
"It's convenient to have a guide in the party."
"Ersi'na! Guides usually only know the direction to the portal. This is simply because the drow is amazing. He memorized all the topography of the first floor."
The male swordsman looked at the female archer and shook his head.
"But where the hell does that blood trail lead to? Haven't we been walking for a while now?"
"I don't know. But even considering the mental fortitude to crawl that far, it seems like your statement that he was just lucky is wrong."
"Huh, what's the big deal…... It's gotta be around here anyway."
The group followed the blood trail and then took a shortcut. After about 15 minutes, they reached their destination.
"It looks like we're the first to arrive using this path. It was worth rushing. Let's activate it."
The blonde put his hand on the tombstone in front of the dead end, and a blinding beam of light erupted, taking the form of a sphere.
It was the portal to the second floor.
"Wait a minute."
Just as everyone was about to jump into the portal, the female archer stopped them.
"That, isn't that what the barbarian was wearing before?"
"What?"
The group looked in the direction the female archer pointed, and everyone was speechless for a moment.
In the darkness revealed by the light of the portal, there was a bloodstained trap and a single unknown sandal lying alone.
“…It seems that's right."
The mage smiled curiously, then created a new sphere of light and moved it beyond the passage.
Whoooosh-!
The blood trail that started from the trap continued along the curved passage.
Even if you moved the sphere of light, you couldn't even gauge its end from this position.
Silence fell for a moment.
“…Drow, how long would it take to get from here to where that barbarian was before?"
“…Assuming you don't use a shortcut, it'd be about 15km."
"Haha, what a monster of a body. To crawl that far alone in this darkness."
The mage just chuckled in amazement.
However, the male swordsman beside him couldn't help but do so.
“…He's insane."
It felt like a matter of the mind, not the body. He thought about it.
‘…If I were in that situation, how long could I crawl? With no assurance that I could meet people and get help?’
I don't know.
But one thing is for sure, the barbarian was crawling when we first found him. He kept moving his arms and legs, seemingly unconscious.
What happened next?
He couldn't even speak properly, but he raised his hand.
He had a small magic stone in his hand.
I didn't think much of it at the time, but now I think I understand what it meant.
‘He must have meant, give you this and help me.’
Because he had nothing else to give in return.
So the barbarian kept the magic stone in his hand as he crawled that far. Just in case he met anyone, he could show it to them immediately.
Then the man came to a conclusion.
“…I have to take back what I said before."
He was just lucky?
That guy will die early anyway?
No way.
He knows from long experience.
"Drow, what was that barbarian's name again?"
Guys like that don't die easily.
No matter how hard and desperate the present moment may be.
Because they never use death as an escape.
