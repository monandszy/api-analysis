Part(text=Episode 306 Rainwals (4)

Did my recruitment offer come as such a surprise? Amelia examined me, her gaze attempting to decipher my intentions. Eventually, finding no ulterior motives, she spoke in a somewhat bitter tone, “I… am a raider.”

“You’re from Noark, it's only natural. But I know better than anyone that you're different from them."

Indeed, during our first encounter, Amelia had spared both me and Einar. The same went for our encounter in the sewers. The dwarf, Rotmiller, Misha, and even the dwalki. Not just a 'barbarian' like me, she had considered other options, even using the precious 'Blessing of Lethe' on all of us.

Therefore...

"Information about me is registered with the Explorers' Guild. Surely, the royal family knows about it too—"

I firmly cut Amelia off. "We can always create a new identity."

"It's not as easy as you make it sound. If I stay by your side, a noble, people are bound to dig into my past—"

*Sigh*, she's awfully talkative today.

"That's why I said I'd take care of those constraints. When the time comes, when it's all clear, join my clan."

"That's… impossible, hence why I am telling you this now. It'll be troublesome for both of us if you try to force it when the time—"

"Look, just consider it a bet."

"A bet…?"

"Yes. Whether it's possible or not, I'll be the judge of that. All you have to do is give me an answer."

A binary choice: 'Yes' or 'No.'

As I neatly laid out the situation, Amelia hesitated for a moment before sighing. "Haah, why do you always put me in difficult situations…."

"So, what's your answer?"

"Alright. If the time comes when my presence by your side poses no problems…"

Amelia trailed off, averting her gaze. However, she seemed displeased with her unconscious action.

Slowly, Amelia lifted her head and met my eyes. "At that time, I'll become your comrade."

*Quest Accepted.*

***

*Quest Name: Save my Sister!*

*Objective: Sister's survival (0/1), Resolve identity issue (0/1)*

*Reward: Amelia Rainwals (SSR) Recruitment Ticket*

Well, roughly speaking, it felt like that.

As I was mentally summarizing the quest, Amelia grabbed the bottle of liquor from the table and gulped it down.

"I thought you said you weren't drinking because you don't get drunk?"

"I'm thirsty."

Oh, I see. But hearing those words while she chugs down the alcohol seems pretty macho.

*Thud.*

Amelia slammed the bottle down, frowning. Seeing this, I couldn't help but ask, "Do you… dislike the taste of alcohol?"

"How can anyone find this palatable?"

“No, just checking. I don't particularly enjoy the taste of alcohol either.”

They say it starts to taste sweet after you've been through a lot, so I thought I'd ask. It seems like I’ve also gone through enough hardships, but still…

“……Enough with the idle chatter, let’s get to the point.” 

With that, Amelia sat down across from me.

“You said you wanted to hear about Nibels Enche, right? I’ll tell you. Hearing your thoughts might spark some new ideas.”

“Good.”

“Ah, and one more thing. Let me be clear, me becoming your comrade depends on you keeping all the promises you’ve made. Got it?”

“But didn't I ask you to join my clan, not become a comrade?”

“Ah, um…” 

Amelia flinched at my words.

“That too… I see. I… I really thought it meant the same thing. If they're different, then let me correct my—"

“It's fine. Now that I think about it, comrade does have a better ring to it than clan member.”

“...Were you just teasing me?”

Sharp as ever.

"No way."

Amelia looked at me suspiciously, but couldn't say anything without proof.

Time to change the subject.

"Just tell me. Everything you know, including about Nibels Enche."

Getting back to business, Amelia put aside her playfulness and started to recount her memories.

“Nibels Enche was the name of the man who saved my life that day. ‘Iron Mask’ was the alias he used in Noark.”

“I knew it.”

Finally, the uncertainty was cleared. 

I am this woman’s lifesaver. 

Heh, I knew there was a reason why everyone in Noark has been unusually docile ever since I descended there wearing the Iron Mask. 

“That’s why I kept wondering if I should even tell you. I came here to change the past, but once I arrived, it felt like the more I struggled, the more everything just flowed in a predetermined way.”

“I see.”

No need for further explanation as I had already gone through a similar experience. 

“But I told you I wouldn’t give up, didn’t I? Anyway, tell me. When… no, after that, when did you meet Nibels Enche again?”

“I don’t recall the exact date. But if my memory serves me right, it was about three weeks from now. The location was inside the castle…”

Afterward, I spent a long time talking with Amelia, learning what I needed to know.  Amelia, unlike before, didn’t hesitate or try to probe me, honestly revealing everything.

It was, in a way, the first perfect communication we’ve had.

Of course, that didn't mean a solution instantly presented itself. 

“Anything else you’re curious about?”

“No, I think I’ve heard all I need to.”

“I see, then…”

“I’m sorry. To be honest, I’m not sure yet. I need more time to think.”

“Is that so…”

Amelia looked disappointed at my reply that even I couldn’t come up with anything, but she didn't say anything else. 

“Well, I suppose you wouldn’t come up with a solution right away either.”

“It sounds like you had no expectations whatsoever.”

“...Strange fellow. If that were truly the case, I wouldn't have told you any of this, would I?”

“Hmm, so you do trust me?”

“...To an extent.”

“To an extent, huh.”

I couldn't help but chuckle at her response. 

Normally, I would’ve considered it a slippery answer, but coming from Amelia, it made me feel a sense of accomplishment.

You know, it's like how you might brush off praise from your parents, but when someone who's usually harsh gives you a compliment, it feels like you’ve earned their recognition. 

“Anyway, if you have no further questions, it’s my turn now.”

“Huh?”

“What’s with the surprised reaction? It’s only natural that I’m curious about you too.”

“Ah, right. Go ahead. What are you so curious about?”

“What exactly did you talk about when you met Auril Gabis? You didn’t tell me the details back then.”

I thought she'd ask about the world I lived in, but it wasn't like that. 

This girl has zero interest in useless curiosity.

Well, it makes things easier for me. 

“Actually, what I told you before is all there is to it. But since you’re curious, I’ll start from the beginning. When I opened my eyes, I was in a very familiar-looking mansion. Ah, explaining why it felt familiar would take a while…" 

“Go ahead. The night is still young.”

“Uh… alright, if you say so.”

And so, I told her everything that happened when I visited the spirit world last month.

Naturally, the names of the beings I met there also came up.

The Head of Orculus.

The Doom Bringer, Belveb Ruinzenes. 

And the unknown man called ‘Caguleas.’

“Caguleas? That’s a name I haven’t heard before.”

Unfortunately, Amelia didn't know anything about that man either. 

Well, the other two were a different story.

“The Head of Orculus was there… There were rumors about them being an evil spirit, but to think it was true. Then did you also come from the same place as the Head?”

“That’s not it either. It's not like all evil spirits are from the same dimension.”

“Is the Doom Bringer the same?”

“Probably. Our people started getting dragged here around the same time.”

“I see… I’ve heard some amazing stories today. I didn’t know about the Head, and there weren't even rumors about Ruinzenes being an evil spirit.”

“Speaking of which, I’d like to hear more about them.”

Once again, Amelia tried to secure her safety net before giving out information. But she had a lot more useful information than I expected. 

Well, that's because I knew so little.

There wasn't much information about the Head or the Doom Bringer available to the public. 

As a Noark native with many connections to Orculus, Amelia's level of common sense was naturally different from mine.

“So, will you be summoned there again on the 15th?”

“Probably. He said he’d settle the fairness issue at the end, but I’m curious to know what happened. Oh, is there anything you want me to ask him? I can ask him next time I’m there.”

“...I’ll think about it.”

Since there was nothing more to talk about, we parted ways and went to our beds. The day felt especially long, probably because we stayed up almost all night.

But as I lay down, did another question pop into her head?

"Biyeon, what was the world you lived in like?"

Uncharacteristically, Amelia asked me all sorts of questions, and I answered each one diligently.

Democracy, science, cars and airplanes, missiles…

The conversation got longer because I had to explain every word I said, but it wasn't boring or tedious.

It was a first.

It was the first time I had this kind of conversation with someone in this body.

Unlike usual, where I had to hide the fact that I was an evil spirit and think twice about every word I uttered, with Amelia, there was no need for such caution.

How much time had passed? 

“It was quite an interesting story. Though I knew most of it.”

“What? You already knew? How?”

“There are many evil spirits in Noark who have revealed their identities. You hear all sorts of stories as you live among them.”

“I see… Wait, then why did you even ask me that?”

“That’s…” 

Amelia trailed off.

A long silence followed. 

“Don’t tell me… are you asleep?”

“...”

“Don’t pretend to be asleep. I know you're only half asleep like a dolphin.”

“...”

Is this what they call "the student surpassing the master"?

She caught on to one of the two ways to make me angry and used it against me. 

“...Are you really asleep?”

“…”

Oh, now she’s even snoring.

Haah, this is ridiculous. Is this for real?

I had no way of knowing, but I decided to stop talking and closed my eyes.

The reason was simple.

If she was finally able to fall into a deep sleep after a long time, I didn't want to disturb her. 

“...Sleep well.”

I turned my back to face the wall and closed my eyes, soon drifting off to sleep.

***

Time flew by after that day.

Well, maybe not flew by…

To be honest, it was a very tedious period. 

I had refrained from going out in order to avoid creating any variables, so I spent all my time cooped up inside.

Ah, but that doesn't mean it was meaningless. 

"Biyeon, go wash up."

“Why, I am not going anywhere?"

"You… smell." 

We talked all day long. 

We talked about all sorts of things.

Sometimes it was about my hometown, other times about Amelia and her sister’s childhood, and sometimes about our experiences in the labyrinth.

Anyway, through our diverse conversations, I got to know Amelia better.

Perhaps the biggest takeaway was finally getting to know about Amelia's Essence composition.

‘She hasn't had any proper team play, has she? I don’t understand how she only made it to the 8th floor with those specs.’

Amelia's stats were far better than I had anticipated.

To be honest, if she had the Arc's Greatsword and 'Dragon Language,' she could even be considered a cut above the Dragonslayer. 

‘But she has the talent of a Guide, not just combat skills.’

Based on this, she could be a scout, and as an Aura user, she could even act as a heavy damage dealer, able to cut through physically resistant monsters with ease.

The downside is that she's physically weak… 

But that's only a problem if I don't tank properly.

“Ah, right. How did it go today?”

“As expected, we were rejected."

Amelia, who had finished showering, answered, drying her hair with a towel.

Tsk, I knew it.

"Hmm, maybe I didn’t offer enough…"

The attempt to buy out the Rainwals sisters, who were currently acting as 'beaters' for another team, had failed.

“What were they like? Did it seem like they might change their minds if we offered more money?”

“I don’t know. But I don’t think that’s a good idea. If they knew we were fixated on them, they'd not only be wary but also try to use it against us.”

“That’s true. Everyone here is shrewd.”

“But we managed to approach them naturally. Fortunately, they were the ones who showed interest in us first.”

“Interest, you say?”

“They asked if we’d be interested in joining their team.”

In a way, things were going according to our plan, but neither of us looked happy. 

It was because this was exactly what had happened in the past.

“It’s so… suffocating how perfectly things are falling into place.”

In the original history, we would be joining that team. 

And after experiencing various events, we would eventually face *that* incident about five months later. 

“So, what are you going to do?”

“...I’ll join their team as planned. It’s a bit frustrating, but it’s the best way to be close by when the incident occurs.”

“Really? Then let’s do that.”

I didn't object.

No matter how I thought about it, I didn’t think we could change the past like this, but I couldn’t think of any other way. 

For the time being, I decided to follow Amelia’s plan. 

At least until a better plan came along. 

So, in that sense… 

[23:55] 

I checked the time once more.

Amelia looked at me and said, "Come to think of it, today’s the day."

“Yeah.”

I took a sip of water and lay down on the bed. 

"Take care."

Her seeing me off felt strangely awkward.

"It's not time yet. We still have five minutes. It’s only for a brief moment here anyway.”

“Ah, that’s true." 

After that, I spent time making idle conversation with Amelia.

Was it because it was Auril Gabis she was meeting? 

I felt a bit tense—

*Click.*

At that moment, the second hand of the clock on the nightstand clicked, and my vision blurred. 

‘The cider back then was delicious.’

I wonder if she’d give me more if I asked?
