Chapter 80: Sewers (1)
How long had we been walking through the sewers, wary of our surroundings? The dwarf, Dwalki, and Misha were starting to get impatient.
"There's really nothing here," Dwalki grumbled.
"I know, right? I wish something would show up already..." Misha sighed.
I should have known better than to let them tag along. What exactly did they expect to find?
"I told you, it's just a simple patrol. We go through the designated route and come back out," I explained.
This mission was straightforward. We were to wear the borrowed video recording device and check for hidden individuals along a specific route. Of course, there was always the possibility of a fight, but…
"The previous patrolman didn't find even thirty people in two years," I recalled.
The chances of encountering someone were slim. And even if we did, we weren't obligated to chase them down.
"Wait, we don't have to capture them?" Misha asked, surprised.
"There's a bonus for catching them, but it's not a priority."
"Why not?"
"Because my assignment is to patrol the sewers," I explained. "The authorities will review the video footage and send someone to deal with any captures or arrests."
"Oh, I see…" Misha nodded.
As I was explaining the mission to Misha, Lotmiller, who was leading the way, suddenly stopped.
"I feel like there's something nearby," he muttered, relying on his gut instinct.
His words made everyone alert. This sewer was filled with a foul stench, but…
"I see someone! Over there!" Misha shouted, pointing to a spot.
I followed her gaze and saw a man with a panicked expression.
"He's hiding!" I whispered, surprised.
The gap was barely big enough for a person to squeeze through. The man was curled up inside it like a shrimp.
"Agh!"
I reached in, grabbed the man by the collar, and pulled him out. He was tall but skinny, making him feel as light as a goblin in my grasp. His behavior wasn't much different either.
"Die!"
As he was dragged out, he stabbed at me with a dagger he had clutched in his hand. It was a valiant effort. Desperate people do desperate things.
"Gah!"
I grabbed his wrist, twisted it, and with a sickening crack, the battle was over.
"Why were you hiding here?" I asked.
The man quickly changed his tune.
"Please spare me! I didn't harm anyone! I was just broke!"
That wasn't the answer I was hoping for, but...
"He means he couldn't pay his taxes and ran away," Dwalki translated.
None of us believed him, but...
"This reminds me of back when I worked at the forge," Lotmiller chuckled. "We'd often get these thugs with tattoos like this. Ha-ha-ha!"
The man's tattoos were different from the geometric designs of barbarian tattoos. His skin was covered with images of skulls, naked women, and monstrous figures. I don't judge people based on their appearance, but...
"Bjorn, look at the brand on his forehead. He's definitely a criminal who escaped into the sewers," Lotmiller pointed out.
The brand on his forehead, concealed under a hood, was proof of a heinous crime that couldn't be covered with a mere fine. There was no room for sympathy. Even if he was just a tax evader, the outcome wouldn't have been much different.
"Bjorn, what do you intend to do with him?" Dwalki asked.
"I don't know."
"The authorities must have given you some guidelines."
They did offer some advice. The basic rule was to capture and bring them back, but if we got the video footage, we could kill them and dump their bodies in the sewers.
"They said we could kill them? What if it's an innocent person?" Misha asked.
"No innocent person would wander into a place like this," Dwalki said.
"Ha-ha-ha! The authorities are as ruthless as ever!"
I think they were trying to spare us, the explorers, from any unnecessary trouble. That wasn't the main concern right now.
"So, what are you going to do?" Lotmiller asked.
"I'll take him in for now."
If I were alone, it would be a different story. We were five strong, so we had the manpower. Plus, we'd get a five thousand stone bonus for bringing him back alive.
"Please, have mercy on me. Just pretend you didn't see me. I'm in this mess because I..."
"Enough."
We didn't need a long conversation. Whether he was a tax evader or a criminal, whether he was forced into crime for whatever reason, what did it matter?
"I was assigned a task. I'm taking you with me. They'll decide what to do with you."
"Damn it! You bastards! What makes you any different from me?"
We were different. If we were the same, you wouldn't be begging for your life.
"Dwalki, shut him up."
"Aye, aye, sir."
Dwalki used his newly learned [Paralysis Toxin] spell to silence the man. His body stiffened. I slung him over my shoulder like a sack of rice and continued walking.
About an hour later…
"Lotmiller, how much further?" I asked.
"We're about halfway there."
"Ugh, we're only halfway done?" Misha groaned, feeling like she had made a mistake by tagging along. She then asked a curious question.
"Dwalki, how come you're fine? Last time, you were puking your guts out."
"Ah, well, you see, I learned a spell that blocks smells. Apparently, it's essential for explorers who dabble in magic," Dwalki bragged, boasting about his new spell.
"Whoa, really? Can you cast it on other people?" Misha asked.
"Uh… well, I'm not quite used to modifying the spell yet…" Dwalki trailed off.
I chuckled. It wasn't that he wasn't used to modifying it; he just couldn't. Spell modification was the bread and butter of mage tower wizards. They would teach you basic spells for a price, but they would never share the secrets of modifying spells or creating new ones.
"Let's make a deal! Spare me, and I'll give you information!"
The man suddenly began to writhe around, screaming, as the [Paralysis Toxin] wore off.
"Information?"
I stopped Dwalki from reapplying the toxin and asked, "What kind of information?"
"That crazy woman! You'll get a much bigger reward if you catch her!"
"Bjorn, what are you listening to? He's just trying to save his own skin," Dwalki said.
I was inclined to agree, but... one word kept echoing in my ears.
"Crazy woman? Tell me more."
It was worth hearing him out.
***
Negotiation. The act of persuasion and discussion to reach a decision. It was both rational and absurd. If the parties involved weren't on equal footing, someone was bound to suffer. Just like this...
"I need a promise before I talk!"
"Dwalki, just redo the..."
"I'll tell you everything!"
The man was desperate to avoid missing this opportunity. He began to pour out his story.
"There are many others living in these sewers besides me. They usually avoid the patrol routes, so they're rarely seen..."
"Be brief."
"A crazy woman took over my hideout a few days ago."
The man's story was simple. He was living a decent life in the sewers until a woman showed up and stole his home. But this wasn't an ordinary woman. She was frail, but she had skeletons with her, so he couldn't fight back.
"Skeletons? You mean someone who consumed the essence of a Necramia?" Misha asked, mentioning the level 7 monster.
But the man was adamant.
"I don't know what that is exactly, but it was definitely not the skeletons you find in the labyrinth! I used to be an explorer, so I know what I'm talking about!"
"So, what's the bottom line?"
"She must have used wicked black magic. You'll get a huge reward for turning her in. Way more than for someone like me!"
I pondered for a moment. The timing was uncanny. A woman who used black magic and hid in the sewers a few days ago…
"Could it be her?"
"Elisa Behenk. If that woman was running, this is the only place she could have gone," Lotmiller and Dwalki said, their voices hushed.
"Damn it, is it really her?"
I needed more information. I couldn't be certain yet.
"What did she look like? Tell me everything."
"She was wearing a robe with a hood covering her face. I couldn't see her clearly. I only knew it was a woman from her figure and voice, but that's all."
"I see."
"Oh! I remember now. She was wearing a very unique necklace..."
"What kind of necklace?"
"It's hard to explain... "
Something clicked. I quickly pulled something out of my bag. The symbol of the Karui cult, which I had found while rummaging through Hans' bag.
"Was it shaped like this?"
"Yes! That's it!"
Seeing the man nod in confirmation, I sighed. The likelihood of it being her had skyrocketed.
"What are we going to do?" Dwalki asked.
"I'm thinking."
"Ha-ha-ha! Why are you even thinking? Let's grab her and serve justice!"
Justice? He just wants the reward. Anyway, Dwalki was the radical, while Lotmiller was the moderate.
"I think we should head back to the authorities and report this officially first. We're not even sure if it's her yet. We don't need to risk our lives," Lotmiller said.
Both opinions were valid. We could catch her ourselves and claim the reward, or we could report it and leave it to others. But…
"Something feels off," I said.
If the crazy woman was indeed Elisa Behenk, then turning back would be especially unsettling. Elisa Behenk wasn't just an "asshole." She was an "asshole" who had a grudge against me. I couldn't help but worry that she was up to something in the shadows.
"Even if the authorities or the temple send people, it'll take at least a few days..."
What if she escaped while we waited? I'd have to live with that feeling forever.
"I want to check it out. What do you guys think?"
Misha immediately agreed. Dwalki, who was usually neutral, followed his best friend, the dwarf. Even the apprehensive Lotmiller bowed to the majority.
"If four of you are on board, I'll go along. But first, let's finish the patrol assignment."
"You're right. Let's do that."
We moved more quickly, completing the designated route that the authorities had given us.
"Where's your hideout? Lead the way."
"You have to promise to spare me."
"If she's the woman we're looking for or if she's worth saving, we'll let you go."
"Alright, follow me."
"Wait, let me tie this on you first."
"Uh... what?"
What "what"?
I tied the man's waist with a rope, making sure it was tight. I then held the long end of the rope like a leash.
He's bound to run, right?
"Alright, now let's go."
"... This path is not on any map, so follow me closely."
The man started guiding us through the maze-like sewers. I noticed that the structure was incredibly complex. We had been walking along the main path with sewage flowing through it, but...
We squeezed through a narrow gap that looked like a wall, and a new space opened up. There were forks in the path, and we even had to climb through holes in the ceiling.
A question arose in my mind.
"Why were you hiding in that spot? You got caught."
"... I was looking for a new hideout. I heard you guys from a distance and tried to hide, so I didn't have time to react."
Well, he certainly had bad luck.
"We've arrived."
The man stopped at a spot with a hole, about two and a half meters in diameter. I didn't know what this space was designed for, but the path below the hole led to a large area.
"Everyone, keep your voices down."
"Ha-ha-ha, this is getting interesting," Dwalki said, excited.
Misha was a little scared, but I wasn't particularly worried. It was a coincidence, but we were all together in the sewers. Plus, we were all significantly stronger than before.
If the woman down there was Elisa Behenk…
"Hey, is there any escape route inside?"
"No, there's no other entrance besides this hole."
This time, we were going to show her what justice truly meant.
