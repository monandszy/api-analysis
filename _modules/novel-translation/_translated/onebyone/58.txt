It seems like we won't be able to communicate with them. Chapter 58: Survival Rules (1)
"That, that woman, how did she follow us! Wasn't the Witch's Forest supposed to be safe!" Misha exclaimed, her face filled with annoyance.
"Stubborn bitch!"
I agree with her sentiment. However, let's try to rationally deduce the situation instead of just hurling insults…
Once we entered the Witch's Forest, she would have been unable to chase us alone. 
Therefore, she must have sought out an explorer she could use.  Posing as a pitiful priestess who had lost her companions to ruthless plunderers.
“Excuse me, there seems to be some misunderstanding. That woman is a priestess of Karui—"
"What! Now I see, they are not mere looters but followers of a wicked evil god!"
"No, that's, that's not us, it's that woman—"
"Quickly, surrender your necks and accept the divine judgment!"
The dwarf tried to engage in a conversation, but the man, his brain pickled in the divine grace, only absorbed what he wanted to hear.
"Davis! Please unleash the divine wrath upon those wicked beings! Only then can my comrades, wandering through the netherworld, lay down their resentment and return to the embrace of God!"
With Elissa's cry, the opposing group of explorers drew their weapons in unison. 
And so did we. 
It's common for fists to speak louder than words during conversations between explorers.
“Don't worry about injuries, just focus on eliminating the enemy! The blessing of Leatras shall be with you!"
The words, "I'll heal you, so crawl like a dog," caused the opposing leader to roll his eyes and charge toward us. He shouted his characteristically vile slogan.
"May the stars that rise in the twilight guide us!"
To be honest, I struggled to understand why they went to such lengths to help that woman. 
The one who looks like a devout believer, I get, but the others don't need to be like that—
"Don't hold back! If we kill them, we'll get a priest in our team!"
"Woooo!"
Ah, so that's it. It wasn't a religious reason, it was a practical one. They were trying to kill us.
Apparently, that bitch had made some promises in exchange for rewards…
Okay, I've got a grasp of the situation.
Kuwong-! 
Blocking the leader's axe with my shield, I yelled,
“You idiots! If a priest joins, who's going to leave the team?”
They were a five-person team from the start. 
In other words, if a priest joined, one of them would be kicked out.
The moment I pointed this out, the leader was taken aback. 
“D-Don’t be swayed by your wicked words!"
Wicked words?
Judging by his reaction, I'm guessing this wasn’t something he had considered. 
“Uh, uh?”
As if to prove it, the four explorers, excluding the leader, faltered for a moment.
Sadly, that moment wasn't long.
“Well, it won’t be me.”
"Huh, that's something we can figure out later."
"Someone among us might die today."
"I don’t care about any priest. If I sell this equipment, I can play for a year."
Damn, what a bunch of explorers.
Their reasons are all so psychopathic.
All you need is a reason and money, right?
"Well, at least they’re consistent. That’s good." 
With the dwarf, I built a wall of shields and analyzed the enemy's forces.
"Three melee fighters, two ranged, and a priest playing dress-up…"
The explorers who came to the Witch's Forest were practically at our level. 
In fact, they even had one more member.
This time, there was no need for deliberation.
Given that Elissa couldn't use the power of the evil god because she was playing dress-up, it was clearly a disadvantageous situation.
But if I were to formulate a strategy…
“We have to take them out with a surprise attack.”
So, I summoned the mage.
"Dwalki!"
No need for long explanations.
“10 seconds! Give me 10 seconds!”
I guess he’s gotten some experience, because he responded as soon as I called his name.
But perhaps the other side has gotten some experience too.
"It's a mage! The other side has a mage!"
They immediately launched a concentrated attack against Dwalki, recognizing his presence.
The three melee fighters were manageable with the dwarf and me, but…
Whiii-iik-! 
It was physically impossible to block the arrows and projectile skills aimed at Dwalki while he was chanting.
But I wasn't too worried.
We're a team of explorers, after all.
I don't have to do everything myself.
"Ugh!"
Misha deflected the incoming arrow with her dagger, and Rotmiller blocked the projectile ability with his shield.
Simultaneously, the spell was complete.
“The 8th-grade attack magic, Ice Lance, was cast by Dwalki, the Riole Warve.”
It wasn't an enhanced ice lance, but it didn't matter.
They're not a giant monster.
This should be enough to send them straight to the embrace of God, assuming it hits their vital point.
Whiii-iik-!
Firing magic at a person, not a monster.
The time to display that determination arrived much sooner than anticipated.
Would Dwalki make the right decision?
Kwang-!
Thankfully, the ice lance flew straight at Elissa’s head, negating my concerns.
However, sadly, it missed.
That's why explorers are more challenging than monsters.
“Whew, that was close. Are you alright?”
“Y-Yes! Thank you for saving me!"
She knew the magic was coming, and she also knew there was a high chance it would target her, the priestess.
Therefore, there was no reason for her not to block it. 
An explorer who had gone beyond the third floor to the fourth would have that kind of physical ability.
"Well, humans are the most annoying, after all." 
It wasn't easy.
Just as Rotmiller and Misha successfully protected Dwalki, the opposing side wouldn’t be easily defeated. 
Therefore, it was time to make a final decision.
We’ve seen enough. 
“Dwalki! Use the voice control magic!”
“Yes, sir!"
He cast the spell without any questions, as if he wouldn't take any questions.
Voice control.
Simply put, it's a convenient magic that allows for team voice chat.
Now, we could talk among ourselves without the other side hearing.
I glared at the enemy with hostility.
"Murad!"
"What do you want?!"
"Let's run!"
"Hahaha! That's a good idea!"
Fortunately, the dwarf, who held the emergency order authority, agreed with my decision.
After all, even he’s not stupid.
Even if we win this fight, it will be a victory that only leaves us wounded. If that happens, that bitch will use the power of the dark god without hesitation.
If we’re stubborn, the only thing waiting for us is a bleak future.
"Misha! Take Dwalki when you're ready!"
"Okay!"
"Hikuroad, when I give you the signal, use that thing!"
"I will!"
Misha and the dwarf nodded without any objections.
Rotmiller was left to handle the most crucial role, but there was no need to give him specific instructions.
It’s automatic, you know.
“When I start, stick close behind me!"
I can’t trust anyone else but this old man.
Anyway, I don’t think there’s anything else to announce…
"Now!"
The moment I gave the signal, Misha prepared to run by slinging the frail Dwalki over her shoulder. 
Simultaneously, the wrist guard the dwarf was wearing glowed.
“Hikuroad Murad has used the [Guardian's Wrist Guard].”
No. 3112 Guardian’s Wrist Guard.
In the game, it was a constant 5% damage reduction item, and its usage effect increased in power based on the amount of damage it reduced.
By the way, that usage effect…
“Repels enemies forcefully, granting temporary immunity to all harmful effects applied to allies."
Wide-area knockback and debuff removal.
As a 3000-series item, its effect takes precedence over field effects. 
“Status effect [Lost Direction] is removed.”
"Status effect [Hallucination] is removed."
"Status effect [Illusion] is removed."
"Status effect [Pain Amplification] is removed."
The three melee fighters stuck to us were thrown back.
My distorted vision returned to normal, and the world became clear.
Of course, its duration wasn’t long.
I don’t know how much he’s been beaten up lately…
“It’ll be about 20 seconds, at most.”
That includes the dwarf's racial trait that increases the effectiveness of numbered items by 1.5 times.
But that was enough.
It was enough to buy us time to escape.
“What are you doing! Hurry up and run!”
Man, I’ve been chased around this entire expedition.
***
Explorer.
A being who detects the enemy’s movements first and guides teammates along efficient routes.
So, what qualities are necessary to be an explorer?
The answer is incredibly simple.
“Prior knowledge of the labyrinth and data accumulated through experience."
These two things alone would allow you to navigate the first and second floors.  There’s no question about the third floor, a type of open world where the terrain doesn’t change.
However, things change from the fourth floor onwards.
Well, to be precise, it's from the Witch's Forest where the fourth-floor portal is located.
"The usage effect duration of the numbered item, [Guardian's Wrist Guard], has ended."
“Field effect - Witch's Forest is applied.”
The compass is useless, human directional sense is completely gone, and the only terrain features are trees. And these trees move as if they were alive.
Therefore, special abilities are required for explorers to find their way from this point onwards.
“This way.”
Rotmiller's main ability was his sense of smell. 
Through essence, he adjusted his smell stat and was able to accurately locate the path to the fourth floor, even in this bizarre forest.
If your sense of smell reaches a certain level, you can smell magic. You can use that to find your way around?
I don't understand it well, but it’s something like that.
However…
"That explorer on the other side is no ordinary person. It seems like they are closing the distance towards us directly."
Yet, those bastards managed to track us down.
Of course, I couldn’t even sense their presence…
But if Rotmiller said so, then it must be true.
“So, the key is to reach the fourth-floor portal first?”
Just as I was sorting out the situation, trying to understand it.
As if confirming our agreement, Rotmiller announced, 
“We’re going to speed up from now.”
It’s a race against time now. 
If we arrive first, we can avoid unnecessary fighting.
On the other hand, what if they catch up to us before then?
There's nothing we can do but fight until one of us dies.
“The problem is everyone's tired.”
Life doesn’t always go as planned.
Especially when someone is tired and exhausted.
“Kalstain, give me that friend.”
The dwarf decided to take Dwalki from Misha, showing a bit of consideration.
Then the accident happened.
"Ugh!"
To save time, I handed Dwalki to the dwarf while running, but I stumbled.
Misha lost her balance and fell.
Fortunately, the dwarf had already taken Dwalki and was carrying him like a piece of luggage…
“My feet! My feet are cramping! I can’t move!”
Cramps?
I can clearly see that she dislocated her ankle when she fell.
“Don’t move, stay still.”
I immediately stopped and lifted Misha by the back of her neck.
And the moment I slung her over my shoulder…
“Damn it? What is this?"
The light vanished, and deep darkness enveloped my vision.
The dwarf, who was carrying the torch, was definitely right in front of me.
"B-Byorn?"
"…Quiet."
Calmly, I opened my backpack and took out the torch. 
I used my hand to light it and slotted it into the helmet’s groove.
Sure enough, the teammates who were next to me just seconds ago were nowhere to be found.
"Did we miss the health recovery!"
Misha exclaimed in panic.
And I replied.
I don’t want to believe it, but…
“I think… we did."
We got separated in just a few seconds.
“What do we do now! Let’s go after them!"
Misha urged anxiously, but I chose to stay put.
After all, do we even know where they went?
"That way! They definitely went that way!"
That’s what it looks like to us. 
You can’t rely on sight in the Witch's Forest. 
If we head in the wrong direction, we’ll just waste time.
“The best thing to do now is to stay still.”
Trust our comrades. Trust my judgment.
Rotmiller is a scent-based explorer, isn’t he?
He’ll find out we’re gone and come back soon.
“Byorn…?”
Ah, um, yeah…
That’s what should happen…
“How long do we have to wait?”
A minute passed, but the group that had gone ahead didn’t return.
Damn, what’s going on? Should we wait a bit longer?
Just as I was lost in thought.
"Aack!"
A short scream echoed faintly from the darkness.
“Byorn! Did you hear that? It was definitely Murad's voice!”
I’m not sure, but it does sound like it.
If it wasn't another accident, they would have already turned back.
But…
"Something must have gone wrong. We have to help them—”
"Keep your voice down."
"Why?"
"Because we could be in danger too.”
It's not good to make noise.
We still don’t know what happened to the others.
If it was just a monster encounter, they would have had time to come find us.
"That makes it even more important that we go help them—”
Even if I wanted to help, there’s no way.
Unless a consistent sound continues to echo.
I can’t find the right direction based on a single dying scream. 
That’s the nature of the Witch's Forest.
"Shhh!"
Therefore, I covered Misha's mouth with my hand. 
Then I focused on my hearing.
"…Miller… bitch… there."
"…make a break…."
"No… … leave… us… no way…!"
"I'm… sure… they’re going to… try to escape…!"
"………….”
"...Run…!"
A few more death-like voices echoed faintly, then completely disappeared.
The forest fell silent, not even a breeze rustling the leaves.
“…….”
A quiet silence enveloped us, but I stood there for another five minutes.
The missing group never returned. 
I couldn’t say for sure whether they were dead or alive, but one thing was certain.
They’re not coming back, no matter how long we wait.
Which means—
"We’re screwed."
I’m stranded with a beast girl.
In a labyrinth teeming with monsters and looters.
And in the heart of the Witch's Forest, where we can’t even find our way back without an explorer.
Damn it.
