Chapter 56, The Witch's Forest (3)
Karui's Priest.
At least 5 floors must be cleared to qualify for the job, and unlike ordinary priests, it's a hidden class, plastered with various combat spells and curse abilities.
"What the heck! They ran away!"
We had anticipated even complete annihilation in the worst-case scenario, but ultimately, we managed to overcome this danger without any casualties.
How was it possible?
Upon calm reflection, there were several reasons.
"Karui's Priest... they are as fearsome as they say. Bjorn, if it wasn't for you, we would have been in serious trouble."
We had disarmed them early on.
Their swords, shields, spears, and even Elisa's staff. At the time, we didn't think much of it, but it was a stroke of luck that we took the staff then.
Without the staff, her spellcasting would have been hindered.
Well, the key factor is something else, though.
"As always, a reliable Barbarian is the best. I thought that woman was a priest, so Rotmiller was mistaken. But she was just smashing heads!"
"Me too. When you swung your weapon, Bjorn, oh my, my heart was in my throat..."
A blow delivered unexpectedly to both foe and friend.
Elisa, whose head was shattered by this one hit, had to be resurrected by absorbing the life energy of her companions.
However, her resurrection was not in a perfect state.
Of course, how could her body be intact after her brain was destroyed and resurrected?
'I guess her halting speech was because her recovery was incomplete.'
There were several favorable aspects.
But as relief washed over me, a sense of dizziness also crept in. What if we had fought each other at 100%?
Well, I think the odds would have been about 50/50.
Assuming at least two of us would die, whichever side won.
It would have been a fierce battle, no doubt.
Knowing this, they must have used tricks by pretending to be distressed travelers.
'So, it actually helped that our strength was evenly matched?'
Having finished my review of the incident, I quickly checked my condition.
Needless to say, it was at its worst.
"[Energy Depletion] persists."
"The rate of energy recovery is decreased."
"[Inferior Corruption] persists."
"The rate of injury recovery is decreased."
"[Tracking] persists."
"The character's location is transmitted to the caster."
"[Ghost Walk] persists."
"The character experiences minor pain when moving."
"[Vitality Reduction] persists..."
Damn, I'm going crazy.
My eyes are sore, and my head feels like it's been dipped in salt. I feel like I've lost my strength downstairs.
Ugh, damn, how many curses did she cast on me?
"Warning: The character has over 15 overlapping curses. If not treated with divine power or magic, the character's physical abilities may be permanently reduced."
My condition is beyond words.
A complete mess, to put it mildly. To be honest, it's even hard to describe what's wrong with me verbally.
Still, I'm not too worried.
We have a mage in our team.
"Dwarki, please cast a curse removal spell."
"You, you want to remove curses?"
Why are you surprised?
It's making people anxious.
"Didn't you say you can use curse magic?"
"Well, yes, but..."
But, so what?
I stare at him, urging him to speak. Dwarki avoids my gaze and says,
"I said I can use some curse magic, but I didn't say I could remove them..."
What?
"What are you talking about?"
"Since I didn't join the Mage Tower, I'm self-taught. I heard that there's rarely any need to remove curses during exploration..."
Dwarki continued to make excuses.
To put it simply, it's a very straightforward story.
"In other words, you didn't have the money."
Using a single sentence, I summarized the situation, as is typical of Barbarians. Dwarki nodded unhappily.
"Yes. I thought it was better to learn the most necessary things first."
Right, that's our team.
What's the point of blaming anyone now?
We're all in the same boat. Complaining more won't do anything but make us look pathetic.
Let's not cling to the impossible and focus on what we can do right now.
"Rotmiller, is there a way to track that woman?"
"...Unfortunately, no. I've been looking for a way since earlier, but I can't find any clues."
Well, of course.
This is quite troublesome.
Some of them haven't fully realized it yet, though.
"What's your opinion? How dangerous do you think it is?"
"Well, I don't know yet. But it's certain that we need to leave this place immediately."
"Leave... but where to?"
"Wait! What are you talking about?"
Dwarki chimed in as Rotmiller and I were having a serious conversation.
I wish I could tell him to stay out of the adults' discussion, but...
He is a mage, after all.
Maybe if we discuss it, a good idea will come up. So, I'll explain it in a general way.
"Didn't she say as she ran away that she wouldn't let us live? She'll definitely come back for us soon."
"Yes, but if she comes again, we can just deal with her like we did before, can't we?"
No, you think it's that simple?
Is this your first time entering a labyrinth?
He's a mage, but his judgment is worse than Misha's.
"It's definitely a big deal! If we're fighting monsters, and she ambushes us from behind, we'll be in a tough spot!"
It's a universal truth that unseen enemies are scarier than visible ones.
And when she comes for revenge, she'll definitely be almost fully recovered.
'She can choose the ambush timing, too.'
As seen in the earlier preemptive strike, the one who initiates the fight usually has the advantage.
Rotmiller kindly explained this, and Dwarki shut his mouth, completely scared.
"Karui's Priest is lurking in the shadows, targeting us. It seems our journey has encountered a major obstacle. Ha ha."
The dwarf, our makeshift team leader, tried to laugh it off, but the tense atmosphere didn't improve.
Well, they just fought 1:5, so they know better than anyone how troublesome Karui's Priests are.
As our anxiety gradually increased...
"Since things are as they are, we should head towards the Witch's Forest as soon as possible."
I presented the only solution to the current situation.
Rotmiller asked briefly,
"Why?"
"If we get there, she won't be able to track us. The curse problem will also be solved."
It was a reply that omitted many things, but it was enough. Judging from his expression, he seemed to understand what I meant.
"Utilizing the topographical characteristics of the Witch's Forest... a rational judgment."
Rotmiller nodded.
However, he might have had one question?
"But you said this was your first time entering the 3rd floor?"
Yes, that's true.
So, please just go along with it, this old man.
"...I studied at the library."
"The library?"
Rotmiller tilts his head at my excuse, or rather, not an excuse.
But I'm not worried.
After all, there's a witness right next to me.
"Believe it or not, it's true. Bjorn spends his days reading books at the library."
"Wow, a Barbarian who reads books?"
"I thought so, his speech is unusual compared to other Barbarians."
There are gazes that look at me like I'm a freak.
I don't care about attention, just make a decision and get it over with.
"So, what do you all think?"
"I agree with your plan."
Rotmiller gave weight to my proposal, and then the dwarf and Misha followed suit, throwing in their votes of agreement, reaching a quick conclusion.
However, before we rushed off, there was one thing left to do.
Looking at 'Hansen', who collapsed like a doll with loose strings after Elisa escaped, I said,
"What are you all doing? Don't you take off his equipment?"
Even if we're in a hurry, we have to collect what we can.
We're adventurers, aren't we?
Looters and monster slayers.
***
"If we sell everything, we'll get over 6 million stones."
Is he a 3rd floor looter?
The items 'Hansen' dropped were a level higher than those we encountered before.
Of course, if we divide it by 5 here, our earnings will be roughly similar to the last time, but...
"Seriously! We can each get over 1 million stones! I was worried about taxes this year, but thankfully!"
"With that money, I can learn a few more spells! Ah, I'll definitely learn a curse removal spell this time!"
Dwarki and Misha, who suddenly found themselves holding a large sum, happily pictured their future.
However, Rotmiller, the dwarf, and I just smiled ambiguously and remained silent.
After all, what's the point of making money in the labyrinth if we can't return to the city alive?
"We'll sell these spoils of war in the city later and settle up then."
For reference, the three of us with expandable backpacks agreed to share the spoils during our journey.
You never know what the future holds.
Someone could die during the exploration, we could lose our backpacks, or there could be a chance that someone tries to run off with everything.
But during this process, I was slightly surprised.
'I knew about the dwarf, but Misha also has an expandable backpack...?'
Contrary to her impression, she might be a meticulous saver after all?
Maybe Misha is surprisingly sharp when it comes to finances.
"Let's go then."
Having collected our loot, we packed up our campsite and hurried off.
Rotmiller led the way, finding the path, and the rest followed, guarding against any possible surprise attacks.
We focused on moving, avoiding monster encounters as much as possible, using Rotmiller's sense of smell.
How long had it been?
"Warning: The character's energy is continuously decreasing. If not resolved promptly, permanent..."
I'm going to die.
After moving for about 5 hours with curses hanging all over me, my body is in terrible shape.
If it weren't for the stats I gained from the vampire, like demon resistance and darkness resistance, I probably would have collapsed long ago.
"Bjorn, are you... alright?"
"I can manage, don't worry."
I tried to act fine about the dwarf's concern, but to be honest, I'm not fine at all.
Unlike these guys who only have two or three curses, that crazy woman cursed me over and over again.
And these curses are only on me.
'Damn energy depletion...'
Energy Depletion.
A terrible skill that drastically reduces the recovery of stamina, which is consumed when the character moves or takes actions.
For reference, stamina is separate from health, so even high natural regeneration is useless.
'If this was a game, I'd say about 30% is left?'
In games, if the stamina gauge dropped below 10%, the character wouldn't move.
NPCs would sometimes even whine, begging you to kill them.
But I'm not there yet.
Of course, it's incredibly tough.
But it's not life-threatening.
I can still hold on with mental fortitude.
So, I still have some leeway.
"Achievement Unlocked"
Condition: Energy level drops below 5%.
Reward: Mental stat permanently increased by +1.
Right, that's how it's going to be.
I need to think that way to endure it.
Let's just focus on the positive.
Even though I'm pushing myself a bit, the destination is almost in sight.
"The soil is holding moisture, we should arrive in 10 minutes."
A journey of about 5 hours.
Despite our concerns, we reached the Witch's Forest without any attacks.
'We came all this way, and she's not here yet, that means she's not fully recovered.'
All the effort we made to hurry was worth it.
At least, I don't think she gave up on us.
After all, she didn't hesitate to unleash the power of the Dark God in front of us, trying to survive.
If we, the witnesses, return alive and well, she'll be in a lot of trouble.
"We've arrived."
Rotmiller's words rang out, and I shook off the thoughts that had filled my mind.
Ugh, thinking about other things is the best when you're tired.
I was able to skip 10 minutes!
"This is the Witch's Forest... it feels eerie somehow."
"I hear that every mage who first enters this place says the same thing."
"It feels like a sinister magic is vibrating throughout the entire forest."
Dry thorns.
Vines entwined around them, like snakes coiling up.
"Wait, that tree just moved!"
Everything here is alive and moving.
The Witch's Forest.
"The character has entered a special area."
"Field effect - The Witch's Forest is applied."
"Status ailment [Lost Sense of Direction] applied."
"Status ailment [Auditory Hallucination] applied."
"Status ailment [Visual Hallucination] applied."
"Status ailment [Enhanced Pain] applied."
The moment we set foot in the place, relying on torches, a chill permeated our skin.
"All status effects except field effects are nullified."
Ah, I feel like I can live now.
