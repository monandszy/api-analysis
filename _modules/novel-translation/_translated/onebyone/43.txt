“Oh! Bjorn, son of Yandel!”
As soon as I left the magic tower, I headed for the barbarian-only lodgings.
But was it because it was already the second month? More than half of the familiar faces had disappeared, and new barbarians were filling their places.
Apparently, leaving the place as soon as they earned enough money was an unspoken tradition...
‘There must be quite a few guys who died this time among those invisible guys.’
This might be destiny for those born as barbarians. Unlike the elf tribe, who tightly pulled me up from above, barbarians had to make it on their own once they came out into the city.
“Is Einar in?”
“Einar left for the sacred grounds as soon as morning came!”
Well, I had a feeling that’s what would happen.  I hadn’t seen him for two days since coming out of the labyrinth, so I came straight here, but was it a wasted trip after all?
“Do you happen to have heard the news?”
“What news?”
“About the Free Barbarian! The whole city is in an uproar because of him, didn’t you know?”
Instinctively, my body flinched.
“... I, I had no idea. Do you even know his name?”
“Well, I don’t!  Strangely, that’s the one thing that hasn’t been revealed!”
Thankfully, the guild seems to have kept my name anonymous.
“Anyway, to have such a person among our own kind, it’s just an honor! Apparently, he single-handedly beat hundreds and bravely cleared the false charges placed by the guild, isn’t that amazing?”
“...He beat hundreds?”
I swear, that didn't happen. 
All I did was whine to the local chief’s daughter.
How could the rumors have been so distorted already? I'm already worried about what will happen next...
‘...It’ll die down soon. The guild isn't stupid.’
“I’ll come back tomorrow morning, so please tell him if Einar returns.”
“I will!”
I turned and headed towards the inn I was staying at. But what in the world was this situation?
“You, you... you're not dead?!”
The innkeeper was terrified when he saw me, as if he’d seen a ghost. It wasn’t a wrong comparison.  
Without even digging deeper, I heard him confess that he’d taken my room thinking I was dead.
“What about the stuff I had in my room?”
“I cleaned it all out…”
“I clearly paid for three days in advance!”
Unknowingly, my voice was laced with annoyance, and the innkeeper’s face turned pale.
‘I can’t just beat him up—’
No, wait a second.
When did I start thinking like this naturally? 
I flinched at the belated sense of disharmony.
‘…Maybe it was from the very first day.’
In fact, when I look back, everything was slightly strange. 
Even though a man’s neck flew off right after I woke up, my mind was calm. 
It was the same when I committed my first murder in the labyrinth. I thought it was something I had to do, but the process was far too easy. 
It wasn't even a gradual change. From the day I woke up in this body, I’ve been as violent and simple as the barbarians.
‘That’s the same today.’
Breaking out of jail?  
Of course, I came to the same conclusion after deliberation, but there was no hesitation, which was strange.
The same goes for arguing with the old man in the magic tower. 
Getting angry just because I heard something unpleasant? 
Lee Han-soo, the 29-year-old office worker, would never have done that. He wasn't timid, but he wasn't bold either. He was suspicious, the kind of guy who observed and then took action.
‘But what about now?’
So far, I just thought it was a change caused by being in a special environment. 
But the sense of disharmony is growing stronger.
‘I’m certain.’
I soon realized.
Just as the instincts engraved in this barbaric body come out naturally during combat, my mind has changed too. No, it’s not so much a change as it is a fusion.
“I, I’m sorry, okay?! Please stop glaring at me!”
After finishing my thoughts, I sighed. I have changed. 
It’s strange that I’ve just noticed it, but it’s definitely true. But what am I supposed to do about it?
‘To survive here, this is actually better.’
I decided to think of it in the best possible light. 
Well, I can just be more careful about managing my barbarian instincts in the future.
“...I'll let it slide if you give me 30,000 stones.”
Therefore, even though the innkeeper’s behavior was incredibly infuriating, I decided to just get a suitable compensation and be done with it.  The lost items weren’t that big of a deal, the most expensive thing was the clothes I bought for 2,500 stones…
I was more interested in resting than arguing.
“30,000 stones! You're asking for that much just for selling a few trinkets—”
“Didn’t you say you just threw them all away?”
“……”
“Fine, if you’re not going to give it to me, tell me. I’ll tell everyone here what happened to me.”
“…How about letting you use our inn for the equivalent amount?”
“No.”
I don’t plan on using an inn like this in the future.  
Even if taking things from a dead explorer is fine, isn’t it common courtesy to at least wait until the agreed-upon date?
“Ugh, I promise I won’t tell anyone.”
“Of course.”
After securing an additional 30,000 stones, I went to the inn I had my eye on. The average meal price and the price per night were twice as expensive… 
But it was worth it.
‘Now this feels like I’m actually living.’
For one, the room was 1.5 times bigger than my old one. It had a window, and the bathroom even had a private tub. It’s a bonus that it’s much closer to the dimensional square.
After spending about an hour vigorously scrubbing myself clean of the grime from the labyrinth, I threw myself onto the bed. It was so comfortable.
It felt like it was worth living just for this short moment of happiness.  Was that the reason? 
Suddenly, everything that had happened since the labyrinth, and even back in the city, unfolded before my eyes like a panorama.
“Damn it.”
Why is it so hard to get a good rest?
***
As soon as morning came, I went to the first clothing store I saw and bought some everyday clothes. Then I headed to the barbarian-only lodgings.
“Bjorn!! Where have you been all this time?”
“I had some things to do. Sorry for worrying you.”
“Worry? What are you talking about?  There’s no way!  Bjorn would come back alive even if he was thrown into hell!”
Right, that’s the image you have of me.  
Well, I’m definitely better off with this than with some clumsy melodrama.
Since we were both hungry, we headed to a nearby restaurant.
“Oh, have you heard about it?”
As soon as we sat down and ordered, Einar started talking.  I wasn’t surprised this time, as I had secretly expected it.
“Oh, about the Free Barbarian?”
“Huh? The Free Barbarian?  What are you talking about?”
You’re not asking that?
“…Nothing. What were you going to say?”
“Ah!”
He returned to the original topic and leaned in, lowering his voice.
“This is something I heard from the elders… Apparently, someone stole the Creation Orb!”
“The Creation Orb?”
I was truly shocked. 
The Creation Orb referred to the six treasures.  For reference, in the game, the six races - Dwarves, Barbarians, Elves, Beastmen, Dragonkin, and Humans - each guarded one.
And the problem was…
‘Without it, we can’t enter the last floor!’
The Creation Orb is a key item in [Dungeon & Stone].  The ending… well, honestly, I’m not even sure if something like that exists anymore, but you need all six Creation Orbs to open the ‘Door of the Abyss’.
But someone stole it?
“Who in the world would be so bold?”
“I don’t know. They said it was stolen on the day we had our coming-of-age ceremony. The elders said that other races might be in similar situations.”
“…I see.”
It felt like someone had hit the back of my head with a hammer and ran off, but I didn’t show it and finished my meal.
‘Damn it, do I have to live here forever?’ 
In a way, the most hopeful option I had just disappeared. 
But it’ll be at least a few years before the Creation Orb becomes significant to me.
‘…I haven’t even reached the third floor yet, so it’s not something I need to worry about now.’
Ultimately, what I need to do remains the same.  Become strong enough to have as many options as possible when the time comes to make a choice.
Besides, you never know.  
Maybe the thief who stole the Creation Orb will be caught soon.
“Einar, are you free today?”
“I am. I’m not going to the sacred grounds today.”
“Good.”
After briefly finishing our meal, Einar and I headed to the commercial district.
“This is Commelby!  This is my first time coming here. There are so many people!”
Commelby. 
It’s the name given to the second to fifth districts, which encircle the first district, the Imperial District Carnon, in the shape of a ring. Many people simply call it the free market.  That’s how bustling the commercial activity is in this part of the city.  The middle class of Laphdonia lives here, and many craftsmen and shops are concentrated here.  
I was here with Erwen last time.
‘I wonder how she's doing?’
Erwen came to my mind.
Our meetings were always like this, with her coming to the inn I was staying at first.  
But now that I’ve left that inn…
It will be quite difficult to meet again.  
I don’t even remember exactly where the elf-only lodgings were, which I went to once before.
‘Well, I can find it if I have to…'
But I don’t really need to.
As long as her sister is safe, there’s no way we’re going into the labyrinth together. 
‘If fate has it, we’ll meet again.’
Honestly, I’ve been through a lot lately, and my memories of Erwen have faded.  We weren’t that close to begin with.
“Oh! Bjorn, look!  People are eating clouds stuck on skewers!”
What? There’s cotton candy?
I was secretly amazed, so I bought one and took a bite, then put it in Einar’s mouth. For your information, it was real cotton candy.
“I, I can’t believe it!  Humans are all geniuses!  To create such food!”
“Stop marveling and follow me.”
“Don’t leave me behind!  I can’t get home by myself!”
I picked up the pace, and we soon reached our destination. The weapons shop where I had sold my equipment before. 
I sold all of the equipment that had become the culprit for my imprisonment, as well as my own equipment that had turned into scrap metal. The selling price was about 800,000 stones.
I didn’t sell ‘that thing’ I got right before leaving the rift…
‘I’ll just assume it’ll go for at least 500,000 stones.’
“Einar, this is your share.”
“I, I, I, can you really give me this much? I even ate essence thanks to you…”
“Don’t refuse it. It’s your rightful reward.”
For the record, the ratio was 8:2, as promised.  
Even so, this was the most anyone in our group of barbarians made this time.
“Didn’t I promise?  I’d make you rich if you followed me.”
“300,000 stones!  That’s too much!  How many of those clouds can you buy with this?!”
It seems cotton candy has become a new monetary unit for Einar.
“Anyway, I’m starting to get hungry.”
Is it because of the ‘Appetite +9’ effect on the corpse golem’s essence?  It feels like my hunger comes back much faster.
“Already?  It’s not even been three hours!”
“So you’re not going?”
“Of course I am! I’ll buy the meat today!”
We quickly finished selling our equipment and stopped at a nearby restaurant to eat. And just as we were about to leave…
“Bjorn, thank you.”
Einar looked me straight in the eye and said.  
There was sauce on her lips, but her eyes were unusually serious.
Ugh, she does this, and it makes me uncomfortable.
“I’ve told you already—”
“It’s not about the money.”
Huh?  Then what are you talking about?
“I just… I’m thankful you treat me like normal even now.”
I didn’t understand at all.  
But Einar’s expression was too serious for me to just ignore.  So I watched silently, and she spoke with difficulty.
“You… you know how much I’ve changed. Other barbarians avoid me because they don’t think of me as a warrior.”
“That’s—”
“Even these days, humans keep coming up to me and flirting! It never used to happen before…!”
It definitely seems like a serious concern for her, with her warrior pride.  
Honestly, I don’t really relate. 
It must be because my essence is different from the barbarians’.
As I listened quietly, Einar shouted in a furious voice.
“Bjorn!  Tell me honestly! Have I gotten that ugly?”
…What?
“I’ve made up my mind!  Bjorn! I can’t go into the labyrinth with you anymore!”
No, wait a second.
Why does that have to be the conclusion?
***
I’m drinking lukewarm beer. Sitting alone on the first floor of the inn I’m staying at.
“Ugh…”
How can beer be this bad?  
I think I chose the wrong inn.  
The food is pretty good, but the owner can’t brew beer, so it’s useless.
“Ugh…”
I let out a long breath as if to get rid of the bitterness.  At the same time, the conversation I had with Einar that afternoon came to mind.
After her bombshell announcement, we had a long conversation, but the result didn’t change.
“I’m alone again.”
Einar left.  
Her words were a bit jumbled, as is typical for barbarians, but it wasn’t just about her appearance.
[Actually… the elders asked me to become their successor yesterday.]
The elders of the sacred grounds.  One of them, a renowned master swordsman, had taken a liking to Einar.
And today, she made a decision.  
She decided to learn swordsmanship under the elders’ tutelage.
[Anyway, if I go into the labyrinth, it’s only a day here, right?]
I asked. 
Only one day a month. 
Couldn’t we go into the labyrinth together if she just took one day off?  
Einar was just troubled.
[I want to, but… they said there’s a special training method, and I can’t leave the sacred grounds for six months.]
If it’s special training, could it be that?  
If so, I understand why she wouldn’t be able to go into the labyrinth with me for six months.  
I knew how good of an opportunity it was.
[I won’t ask you to wait.  And I won’t ask you to take me in no matter what when the time comes.  I will definitely train hard and become a great warrior who won’t hold you back.]
So, I couldn’t stop her.  
After all, she was forced to make a vow to the raiders in the last expedition.  
And what about the rift?  
Even I, the barbarian, the mage, and even the dwarf, all acted, while she was just powerless.
‘That was probably the deciding factor. For making this decision.’
No matter how much I think about it, I’m sure her changed appearance was just the final push.
“Ugh…”
I took another sip of the lukewarm beer, driven by an inexplicable thirst.
The bitterness came up from my esophagus.
‘I have to find a new companion after all.’
I was planning on taking it easy and preparing slowly this time.
Why do I have to keep getting quests every day?
