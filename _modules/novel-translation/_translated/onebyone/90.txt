Chapter 90: Player (2)
Silence stretched. 
After briefly sorting my thoughts, I let out a tired sigh, as usual. 
Ragna watched me, her eyes opening and closing slowly. 
"You're surprisingly calm. I thought you wouldn't believe me, even after I told you."
What's she talking about? I just sighed because this could actually be true.
"Maybe it's better to ignore it. After all, dimensional collapse is a disaster that's impossible to predict or prevent," she said.
She's right.
Even in the game, dimensional collapses always happened abruptly.
Well, not always, there were many times it didn't happen throughout the game.
'It was about a 1 in 100 chance of happening.'
Of course, it was a huge disaster whenever it did happen.
Maybe not during the late stages of the game when you could somewhat prepare.
But in the early stages? Pressing the ESC key and restarting was the fastest way to go.
"So where did you get this information?" I asked calmly, focusing only on what needed to be confirmed.
My gut told me this was the source of my uneasiness, but you never know.
"A Tarutein mage named Shernell Pergan. Apparently, he's been researching dimensional collapse phenomena for a long time."
She said that was all she knew, and then she added that she didn't know anything else about him.
"I see. I'll look into this. Thanks for the warning." 
As I turned to leave, I heard her voice behind me.
"Are you… leaving just like that today?"
Well, a new quest just popped up, so I need to go do that, right?
***
The usual lively noise echoed from the tavern. 
An elf with silver hair sat in a secluded corner, tapping her fingers on the table. 
It was a habit she had whenever she was troubled.
"Sigh..."
My beautiful and kind little sister, Erwen. 
She'd been different since three months ago. 
She'd suddenly asked for my help with training, something she hated so much before, and she'd been pushing herself to her limits, as if even sleeping time was wasted.
She'd become a bit sharper too.
It was only natural for me, her own blood, but...
Her tone, her gaze, her actions when interacting with others were drastically different from before.
'At least it's a good change, though...'
Excessive ambition and suspicion of others?
Desirable qualities for an explorer whose destiny is to enter the maze.
In fact, she had grown significantly thanks to it. 
My sister, who had successfully contracted with all four great spirits, had awakened three of them, allowing them to develop their own wills.
And that's not all.
Her archery, martial arts, and close combat skills using daggers were improving by the day. 
Honestly, I was wondering why these talents hadn't blossomed sooner.
However, the reason for her sigh was the catalyst for her change.
'I wonder how long I can keep it hidden...'
The death of the barbarian she used to call 'uncle' and look up to emotionally.
It's funny to even call it death.
The man himself is perfectly alive.
He even gained the title of 'Little Balkan.'
'Should I tell her now?'
When I first heard about him, I was surprised. Then, I was uneasy.
I thought it was only a matter of time before she found out.
But what happened was...
Erwen, who was locked in her room every day, dedicated only to training, still hadn't learned about it.
"Did you guys hear? It seems like the Dark Sword might become the Blacksmith's disciple!"
"Hah, where did you hear that nonsense? The Blacksmith, that noble man, taking in a mere adventurer as a disciple? How is that even possible?"
Daria, sitting alone in a secluded corner of the tavern, eavesdropped on the conversations of the surrounding adventurers, finding a sense of relief.
'It's true, the rumors are finally fading away...'
The stories that had been heard everywhere in the city at one time had been buried by new ones.
Stories like the one about the demon being exorcised, or the one about the Karui priest who ran away to the sewers and was killed.
It was a bit nerve-wracking when the barbarian's story started circulating in the tavern again...
But even that has calmed down now.
'Yes, I'll just let it be.'
Daria finally made her decision.
It wasn't really something to worry about anyway.
As someone who chose to live as an explorer, when else would she have such a chance to grow?
"Hey, elf girl. Did you come alone—"
"Get lost. You don't want a hole in your forehead."
Pushing away the approaching drunkard, Daria left the tavern.
She'd come here every evening, worried that the barbarian might cause a stir again, but...
She wouldn't be coming back anymore.
Knock, knock.
She returned to her lodgings and knocked on her sister's door. 
There was no answer.
Worried that she might be asleep on the floor, she pushed the key in.
Click.
The lock opened, and the door creaked open.
Then, I saw my sister.
She was meditating with all four great spirits summoned, her eyes closed.
But...
"I have to..."
Her lips were moving slightly, muttering something.
Daria approached cautiously, holding her breath.
Then, she could hear what she was muttering more clearly.
"I have to be strong. I have to be strong. I have to be strong. Only then can I not lose anything. I can have it all..."
She repeated similar words to herself as if trying to brainwash herself.
"Erwen...?"
Daria quickly woke her sister up.
Surprisingly, her sister's expression was simply peaceful.
"Oh, sis, you're here?"
"Are you... okay?"
"What do you mean?"
"You were... muttering to yourself..."
"Huh? I was just talking to the spirits."
I don't think she was actually talking to the spirits, but...
Daria shut her mouth.
She was under a restraining order.
"I'm training now, so can you come back later?"
"Okay..."
Daria left the room dejectedly.
She returned to her room and pondered the incident. Her demeanor wasn't something that could be dismissed as 'enthusiasm' or 'determination.'
It was almost like an obsession.
It hadn't been like this 10 years ago, during that incident...
'What's wrong? That barbarian wasn't that important—'
Daria froze.
The biggest recent change came to mind.
'Wait, could it be because of that essence?'
Daria took out a book from the bookshelf. 
It was something she had bought from the guild for a hefty sum.
'[Complete Collection of Lower-Grade Essences]'
A book containing information on all essences from grade 7 to grade 9.
First, she checked the essence she had absorbed this time.
'Where's Canibaro…?'
It was a monster that only appeared in the Witch's Forest, but I had gotten its essence when I saved an adventurer who was being chased by it and escaped from the forest.
'Ah, there it is.'
She flipped through the pages, summoned the fire spirit, and read the text.
'[Canibaro] Grade 7.
Agility (Medium), Darkness Resistance (Low), Stamina (Low), Accuracy (Medium), Intuition (Low), Hearing (Medium), Obsession (High).
*Agility and senses increase when moving.
*Magic Mine (Red)
*Hound (Blue)
*Pursuit Arrow (Green)
She read the contents meticulously and froze at a certain part.
"Obsession... is High grade?"
A sudden sense of déjà vu washed over her, and she checked the essence she had absorbed three months ago.
'[Steel Hill Pursuer] Grade 8.
Strength (Low), Physical Resistance (Low), Power (Low), Jump Power (Medium), Earth Resistance (Low), Perception Interference (Low), Agility (Medium), Obsession (Medium)
*Piercing power increases if surprise attack is successful.
*Piercing Arrow (Red)
*Terrain Eruption (Blue)
*Weakness Detection (Yellow)
'What in the…'
Obsession was there again.
And it was a Medium grade.
'Could it be, that too…?'
She even looked at the essence her sister had absorbed for the first time.
And sure enough.
'[Goblin Archer] Grade 9.
Flexibility (Low), Smell (Low), Poison Resistance (Low), Perception (Low), Perception Interference (Low), Accuracy (Low), Sight (Low), Agility (Low), Obsession (Low)
*Grants paralysis poison when using bow-like weapons.
*Sneak
Even here, there was Obsession.
Now, Daria understood the situation.
The excessive obsession with power was all because of this stat.
'What should I do?'
It's not like she could just erase the essence she had already absorbed, even if she paid for it.
But leaving it like this weighs heavily on her heart.
'Maybe... if she eats an essence that can replace it… I'll make her erase it then.'
After much deliberation, she came to a conclusion.
However, after simply washing up and lying down in bed, she encountered a new question.
'Wait a minute.'
If, before that, she learns that the barbarian is still alive...
What direction would this stat shift towards?
***
Ten days had passed since she heard the news of the dimensional collapse.
Whether it was just a baseless rumor, the truth, or just someone's delusion, I wasn't sure.
Even though I had been frantically trying to find out more, I hadn't made any real progress.
"Shernell Pergan?"
Raven, who had always helped me out when I had questions, was no help this time.
"No, I mean, even if you ask me to arrange a meeting for you, I've never heard of that name. The Tarutein mages don't really interact with us in the first place."
"I see."
"Anyway, when you come next week, clear your entire day. Someone won the lottery, you see."
"The lottery…?"
"You forgot? I told you, I'd help your seniors with their research in exchange for finding out about the paper."
No, I remember that.
I just didn't know you were going to choose a winner through a lottery.
'Ugh, this is making me even more anxious...'
If only I had ever been lucky in a lottery.
Anyway, after that, I continued to try different ways to meet this mage named Shernell Pergan, but I failed every time.
Meanwhile, rumors started circulating.
"Bjorn! Did you hear?! They say a dimensional collapse might happen soon!!"
Misha, who had been planning to go see an old friend, rushed back and started fussing over it.
If she knows, then it's already widespread.
In fact, when I went to the tavern that evening, everyone was talking about the dimensional collapse.
But the problem was...
'No one knows the source.'
No one knows who started the talk.
Or what the evidence is.
There's no such thing as a story, everyone is just fueling the anxiety and spreading the rumor.
'This… is strange.'
I felt an unexplainable sense of unease.
Shouldn't there be some kind of plausible evidence for it to spread so widely?
Now, there were various rumors added as evidence, but there was nothing like that at the beginning.
'Could someone be deliberately spreading the rumor?'
As someone who had been watching the situation closely from the beginning, I came to that conclusion.
Of course, it's just speculation...
But the current situation just felt a bit off.
'Ugh, I feel like there really is something going on.'
This is frustrating.
I don't want to just go back and forth from the tavern, I want to learn about the information that's being passed around quietly, in a more hidden place.
But the walls of reality are high.
How would a bare-handed barbarian who only gained fame through combat access that kind of information?
'If it wasn't for Ragna, I wouldn't even know the name Shernell Pergan.'
I finally made a decision.
In my hand was a letter from Ghostbusters and a pill that came with it.
They wanted to ensure complete anonymity, so I was originally going to take it after at least three months...
'But I can push it up a month, right?'
I quickly swallowed the pill.
"Character has consumed GB-027."
I wasn't immediately transported to the spiritual world.
According to the information I got from the secret library that Raven and Ragna opened, the meeting is held at midnight on the 15th of every month.
'I just have to wait three days.'
Time flew by.
And the moment I was waiting for arrived.
A feeling as if my mind was being pulled away from my body.
"Character's soul resonates and is drawn to a specific world."
When I opened my eyes, a computer was in front of me.
***
A pure white space reminiscent of the universe.
I probably wouldn't even have been able to tell which way was up or down.
If it weren't for that computer.
'What is this?'
It was a completely unexpected start, but I slowly started walking towards the computer.
It was a feeling I had never experienced before.
It felt as if I was riding a robot and controlling it to walk.
I waddled over to the computer and checked the monitor, which was turned on.
"[Please enter your password.]"
A short sentence on a black DOS screen.
Without much thought, I entered the password.
"[Rafdonia’s king, Mother fucker]"
That wasn't the PS I was talking about.
