Chapter 9 Night Companion (2)
“…Why are you giving me this?”
“Does helping need a reason?”
It felt like thorns were growing in my mouth when I tried to say something I didn’t mean, but there was no other choice.
This type of person would be more receptive to this approach.
I want to be night companions with this fairy.
It sounds trashy to say it that way, but it’s not a bad thing for her either.
She’s got injuries, lack of sleep, and a pretty face.
If you look at it, she’s in a much better situation than me.
Knowing that, she must have done that bullshit just now.
Honestly, her obsession with life from just now was enough to make me amazed.
“As I said before, take care of your injury first. We can talk later.”
“But… ”
“I’ll be on guard.”
I turned my back, ignoring her, and soon heard a rumbling sound.
It seems like she was chewing herbs for her wound.
“…It’s done.”
Already? She has surprisingly good hands.
I looked back, and I could see the bandage neatly tied between the gaps in her ripped clothes. I could also feel her wariness lessen a bit in the way she looked at me.
I should exchange names first and slowly close the distance between us.
“I’m Bjorn, son of Yandel.”
“…Erwen.”
“I don’t know what kind of misunderstanding you have, but don’t think about what you think.”
“Huh? Oh, yes…”
She feigns ignorance, but the fear in her eyes remains.
I thought this much would be enough to clear the misunderstanding, what exactly went wrong?
Finally, I asked directly.
“Why are you so afraid of me?”
“…Barbarians are enemies of fairies, aren’t they?”
“Enemies?”
“I, I’m sorry. That wasn’t what I meant… I don’t want to fight you, sir.”
My question seemed to have snapped her back to reality, and she started to grovel like before.
I was just genuinely curious…
Fairies and barbarians are enemies? That’s a first. It seems like they were quite close in the game.
How did this happen?
I just glared at her with force, and the information I wanted came out easily.
“…It, it’s the war that ended ten years ago, right? I, I don’t have any resentment from that! I really don’t.”
Ten years ago…
I don’t know what happened, but from what she’s saying, they seem more like rivals than enemies.
Well, then did she grow up hearing bad things about them and became that scared?
The situation became quite a headache.
What should I do? Should I find another person right now?
But I’d feel bad about the herbs and bandages I already gave her…
Fine, let’s try it first.
“I don’t have any resentment either.”
“Is, is that so!”
“Yes. So, Erwen, would you be my night companion?”
“…Night companion?”
“I’m tired now. You must be too, whether or not you have resentment, how about we cooperate just for today?”
“Hmm…”
Suddenly, her eyes widened.
Honestly, I wonder if it’s the same person from before.
I didn’t rush her and gave her time. Erwen, who had been frowning in earnest, accepted my offer with one condition.
“I thought barbarians valued the honor of being a warrior. Can you swear on that? That you won’t hurt me first?”
“Swear.”
“Of, of course, I’ll swear on my clan’s name too. I will never harm you first, sir.”
In Korean culture, it would be like saying to press your thumb on your tongue and your pinky on your forehead.
Of course, I could do it all day long.
However, there’s one issue I need to address first.
“Bjorn, son of Yandel. Not sir.”
I may not know, but our Bjorn is only 20 years old.
***
The agreement was established.
We didn’t sign anything, but we did something similar in this culture.
Thanks to that, I learned the fairy’s real name in the process.
Erwen Fornachi di Tercia.
She was 20 years old, the same age as me.
Phew, it’s a good thing I’m not the real Bjorn. The real Bjorn would definitely think so too. I’m one thing, but she…
I won’t say it out loud.
“So, how should we decide the order?”
“I’ll go first. It’ll put you at ease.”
“Not really, but if you do that, I’d have no choice… ”
In other words, it was an unenthusiastic acceptance.
“I’ll take that as a yes.”
“Yes.”
Whew, I’m glad it went through. If I had suggested rock-paper-scissors, I would have been blind.
My eyes have been closing since before. Please, I just want to sleep. Is it so hard to sleep peacefully?
“Wait! How do we know the time?”
Tsk tsk, that’s why beginners are a pain.
I took out a watch from my backpack and handed it to Erwen.
“It’s an expensive item, so don’t break it.”
“Yes… ”
She takes care of it like it’s a sacred relic, so I feel a bit reassured.
“I’ll be careful. Please get some rest.”
Like the man before, I leaned against my backpack, covered myself with a blanket, and curled up.
And…
Drrrrrr!
I fell asleep like I was knocked out.
“Sir!”
…It’s Bjorn, you know.
“Sir, wake up. It’s time.”
I forced my heavy eyelids open and got up. I can’t believe it.
Two hours already?
“Here, take the watch.”
Looking at the time, it was really two hours.
Now that I think about it, I didn’t even manage to properly fake-snore. I was thinking of doing it for 10 minutes, just in case…
Damn, is this the synergy of backpacks and blankets?
It’s scary.
If the man had lent me this, I wouldn’t have been able to avoid a surprise attack.
I would have been sleeping soundly, oblivious to the world.
Is this karma?
…In that sense, I should lend it to her too.
“Sleep under it. If you want to use this as a pillow, feel free.”
“Huh? But… ”
Her lips are curved upwards, even though she’s declining.
I decided to just pretend I didn’t notice.
“Well, thank you… ”
Even though I didn’t offer again, Erwen went under the blanket and curled up like a cat. Soon after, she began to breathe rhythmically.
Jeez, she’s sleeping well in front of a strange man, isn’t she?
Well, she must be tired. She must have had a hard day, just like I did.
“Whew… ”
I leaned against the wall and habitually opened the watch.
[22:50]
It feels like five days have passed, but there’s still over an hour left until the end of Day 2.
I want to go back to the city already. Honestly, it’s funny to even say that… but if I just go back, I’ll sleep for days.
‘…Seeing that I think this way, it seems like my body is really getting better.’
I put away the watch and truly indulged in my thoughts. Since I’m having a peaceful moment for the first time in a while, thoughts keep popping up.
What happened to my reality?
Was I reported missing? Surely not yet. Who would come looking for me. My company wouldn’t take it seriously for a few days.
“Kick.”
It’s not like I haven’t thought about this issue even once.
Because it just makes me sad.
There’s nothing good about going back, if I think that way, my will would break.
It’s better not to think about it.
Even if it’s nothing but self-deception, I’m pretty good at self-hypnosis.
“… ”
I intentionally divert the flow of my thoughts.
That’s right, I might as well go over what happened these past two days. I finished the coming-of-age ceremony, entered the labyrinth, fought goblins, fought the man…
I can give myself credit for doing well so far, right?
It was really a near-death experience. No one else is going to praise me, so shouldn’t I give myself credit?
Click-
I decided to save the self-praise for when I get back to the city, and when I opened the watch, it was already time.
“Erwen, wake up.”
“Five more minutes… ”
Five more minutes, what kind of five more minutes is that? Wake up already.
“Ugh… ”
Erwen rubbed her eyes and got up as I shook her shoulders with a barbaric hand.
This is dangerous, you know.
Now I understand why the man was so distrustful of me.
“Don’t even think about sleeping again, just because nothing happened so far.”
“Yes… ”
I felt a bit uneasy, but I laid down again anyway.
Maybe it’s because I lent her the blanket and backpack, but the warmth remains even after I lay down again.
It’s ironic.
How long has it been since I felt someone else’s warmth? It’s really unfamiliar.
Maybe even more so than everything I’ve experienced these past two days.
Drrrrrr!
I was a bit more energetic this time, so I started fake-snoring. Honestly, it’s more about checking if she’s not sleeping well than faking it.
…It doesn’t seem like she’s falling asleep.
I opened my eyes slightly and glanced at Erwen, let go of my worries, and fell back to sleep.
And after a while…
Tap.
I felt a presence and quickly sat up.
“Kiyat!”
I don’t know why, but I was holding Erwen’s white wrist.
From the situation, it seems like it was extended towards me…
“What are you doing?”
“I, I, I saw you sweating, so I thought you were having a nightmare… ”
I saw a handkerchief in my hand, so it seems like it wasn’t a lie.
Well, if it were a weapon, I wouldn’t have even asked for an explanation and just smacked her with a shield.
“I, I’m sorry.”
Having understood the situation, I released my grip.
Erwen then rubbed the part that was grasped, making a pained expression.
The mark was already red.
I didn’t bother apologizing. It would just be an empty word.
“How much time has passed?”
“…About 10 minutes left until the shift change.”
“I see. Then let’s change now.”
“But… ”
“Sleeping now will just make you even more tired.”
Erwen lay down, looking apologetic at my words. And after she shifted a bit…
“Sir.”
“Is something the matter?”
“No. I have a question.”
“Ask away.”
Erwen hesitated for a moment before opening her mouth.
“…Who are you, sir?”
What is it? A joke?
“You keep saying sorry in my dream… Oh, I’m sorry. I’m overstepping. You don’t have to answer. I’m going to sleep now.”
Before I could answer, Erwen finished her monologue and covered herself with the blanket.
She seems to be getting curious as she realizes that I’m not that scary.
“Kgh.”
I did a simple stretch and thought about it.
I really don’t remember anything, but judging from what she said, it seems like I had a nightmare…
I’m suddenly a little curious.
Who exactly was the man I apologized to in my dream?
There are two possible candidates.
The unnamed man who was beheaded at the coming-of-age ceremony and Hans, the man who taught me to be human.
…But if you think about it, it’s strange regardless. I haven’t done anything to apologize for to either of them.
I soon reached a conclusion.
Whatever dream I had, it’s just a meaningless dream.
***
[04:30]
Day 3 has begun. And there are about 10 minutes left before I have to wake Erwen up.
I pondered as I looked at Erwen, who was sleeping curled up with the blanket between her legs.
An after-party invitation.
In other words, whether or not to offer her a partnership.
Of course, being partners means sharing loot.
Even though goblins spawn 3 or 4 at a time from Day 3 onwards, Erwen joining would definitely decrease my income.
It has nothing to do with her strength. Well, she’s a fairy, so she’s definitely capable of doing her part…
But it’s already overpowered, isn’t it?
Even without Erwen, I can easily take down 3 or 4 goblins on my own.
It’s not arrogance, this body has been through several battles, so I genuinely believe that.
And I need to collect as many magic stones as possible to pay for my living expenses in the city and for taxes later.
“Whew… ”
A safe place to sleep, or more magic stones.
I was constantly agonizing over the most rational choice when…
Thump.
I could hear the footsteps of explorers coming from the left passageway.
It was something that happened several times during the night watch, so I wasn’t particularly tense. Most of them just take a glance and pass by.
However…
Tap-
The two explorers, who were a chubby one and a skinny one, stopped after looking at us.
Then they whispered amongst themselves.
“Is that the fairy?”
“It seems like it. The bow’s shape matches.”
The chubby one, who decided after whispering, asked me on behalf of them.
“Barbarian, what’s your relationship with that fairy?”
“As you can see, she’s my night companion.”
“A barbarian and a fairy as night companions, what a sight to behold. So, how long is left?”
“I have no reason to answer you.”
Chubby didn’t ask any further.
He just grinned and left with Skinny.
“Okay. Let’s go.”
“Huh? Oh, uh… ”
Soon after, the two disappeared from the surrounding area.
But I couldn’t relax.
What the hell are those guys? It feels just as ominous as when the tribal chief screamed right in front of me.
I slowly moved to the side and tapped Erwen’s shoulder, who was sleeping.
“Ugh… ”
Hey, you’re sleeping right now?
Wake up quickly.
It feels like we’re screwed.
