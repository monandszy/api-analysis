Chapter 67: Field Boss (3)
Pitter, patter, pitter-patter—
Black rain, the mere touch of which scorched my skin. 
I know what this is.
[Rain of Despair]
Chaos Lord Riakis’s passive aura skill. 
“Character is receiving continuous damage from the Chaos attribute.”
“Character’s Demon Resistance has drastically decreased.”
“Warning: Continuous exposure to Chaos attribute damage may inflict the [Chaos] status effect with a certain probability.”
This skill not only deals area damage but also transforms any terrain touched by the rain into a corrupted zone, nullifying all field effects.
In other words,
“Damn it…”
I’d been hoping against hope, but it actually came.
“It’s him! He’s here!”
“Hey! What are you all doing! Why aren’t you going to stop him!”
Panic broke out among the third-floor adventurers who had paid the protection fee.
And they all focused their attention on one place.
“Don’t tell me he’s going to abandon us and run away!”
“You said you’d protect us, and you even took our gear! Take responsibility!”
Dozens of voices erupted with emotional shouts.
The courteous official who had announced things for the crowd several times sighed with a wry smile.
“…It’s come to this, then.”
It’s not hard to understand his current feelings.
Having received the protection fee, the only option they had was to fight the Floor Lord with everything they had.
However…
“This expedition is going to be a huge loss.”
Surprisingly, the official’s face only reflected a mix of confusion, with no trace of anxiety or worry.
After taking a deep breath, he shouted loudly,
“Chaos Lord Riakis has arrived! Everyone, bring out what you’ve prepared!”
The command echoed thunderously.
Those with the Drazarwei clan emblem etched on their chests moved in unison.
“Each team to their designated positions!”
Mages, priests, and ranged damage dealers went towards the center.
Melee warriors headed to the outer edges.
They started using all sorts of consumables without hesitation.
“Used an Advanced Endurance Support Scroll.”
“Used a Stamina Recovery Support Scroll.”
“Used the Number Item [Sun King’s Banner].”
“The light of Ersium descends upon your weapon…”
“….”
“….”
Various types of buffing magic scrolls, disposable Number Items, and numerous equipment support consumables.
In the span of just under a minute, 
Consumables worth at least tens of millions of stones were consumed in a flash of light.
“We have plenty of supplies, don’t hold back! We’re going to make it out alive, no matter what!”
I realized I’d underestimated them.
Now that I looked, it wasn’t about lack of imagination. 
They had already considered the worst-case scenario and had made full preparations in advance.
‘But why did they still take the protection fee…?’
They simply gambled, betting on their side.
Because their odds were slightly higher.
Heh.
I couldn’t help but chuckle.
‘This world is full of efficiency maniacs.’
I need to be more humble.
These people had also reached where they are now by risking their lives countless times as adventurers.
There’s no way they got to this position just because of luck.
“To think they carry this much supplies with them…”
“As expected of a major clan!”
Rather than disdain, I should always be on guard.
Instead of jealousy, it’s more efficient to learn from their example.
“Bjorn, what’s your plan?”
“What else? We’ll observe for now.”
That was the plan from the start.
Now that we’ve encountered the Floor Lord, even leaving this place carries a huge risk.
Well, if we’re completely out of options, we’ll have to make a run for it, even if it means risking our lives…
‘But this should be enough to hold out.’
As if to prove it, a wall of fire enveloped us in a circular shape.
Not a skill from my Essence but a simple magic spell.
“The Chaos Spirit has been destroyed.”
“This location will be corrupted.”
Since the rain began,
The Chaos Spirits that swarmed in like a tidal wave couldn’t break through the wall of fire and dissipated.
Whoooooosh!
The giant barrier above also blocked the pouring rain.
Well, the wall of fire and barrier can only hold out so much.
“Bjorn, look!”
A giant shadow slowly grew in size from the direction Misha pointed.
Accompanied by heavy tremors.
Boom! Boom!
Horns sprouting from its head.
Thick, rough-looking black hide.
An ominous aura rippling across it.
[Rooooooaaaar—!]
A beast of a size that made you lose all sense of distance, the kind you’d see in a monster movie, easily crossed the wall of fire and revealed its form.
“Th, that’s… .”
“Th, the Chaos Lord Riakis!”
While the crowd trembled in fear at the sight, the clan members remained composed.
“Hold your positions! Absolutely no retreat!”
Warriors who treated battles with large monsters as their daily routine, they silently defended their positions.
Did that displease him?
Bang!!
Riakis started the battle by stomping his front leg down.
***
What’s a real raid like, compared to in-game? 
The answer to the long-held question I’d had in my heart was simple.
“Absolutely don’t try to block, just dodge! Got it!”
Not only the melee dealers but even the tanks completely avoided a direct confrontation, nimbly dodging the swinging tail and stomping claws.
After all, they’re the ones who know best.
No matter how tough they are or how high their strength stats, there’s no way they can match a monster like that in a power struggle.
‘So a real battle with a Floor Lord is like this. It’s interesting.’
Maybe because this is a role I’ll have to play someday.
It’s clear that I’m more drawn to the melee adventurer’s battles than the mage or dealer side.
There’s a lot to learn from watching them.
And there were several nerve-wracking moments.
Kaboom!!
No matter how hard they focused on dodging.
In a battle with a high-level monster like this, there’s no way to avoid casualties.
Usually, getting hit like that would mean death, not injury…
“He, he took that hit and he’s still alive… .”
“…Truly remarkable.”
They were already a weapon, having their stats boosted by numerous Essences, various scroll buffs, and the support of priests and support-type adventurers.
“Aaaaaaagh!!”
“Damn it! Almost died!”
Warriors who were completely wrecked returned to the front lines after being healed.
Of course, not everyone was like that.
“Damn it, I wasn’t supposed to die like this… .”
“Don’t get distracted, focus on the battle!”
Casualties were occurring as the battle dragged on.
One melee warrior was instantly killed by being crushed underfoot, and three ranged dealers huddled together were instantly melted by a breath of fire Riakis exhaled.
But let’s analyze the situation objectively…
‘It’s still stable.’
“Fo, four people have already died… I, is it dangerous?”
Whatever the third-floor adventurers were thinking.
The warriors were still holding the front line well.
The combined magic of the mages was also powerful enough to push back Riakis as he approached the center.
‘They seem to know the Dark Sphere pattern well too.’
“L, let’s just watch for now! It’s the renowned Drazarwei Clan, right! They’ll find a way, won’t they?”
Black orbs, rising from the corrupted earth and heading towards Riakis.
“Chaos Lord Riakis is drawing in the power of the Source.”
The thing I was most worried about, even those were being destroyed in midair by the ranged dealers before they could be absorbed by Riakis.
“Cease fire!!”
“He mustn’t feel threatened anymore!”
And seeing that they were stopping their firepower attacks from time to time to manage Riakis’s health, I was now certain.
They know the strategy.
‘So they’re just trying to hold out. If they enter Phase 2 without that item, it’s over.’
“Why are we stopping the attack? Are they all idiots? We should take advantage of any momentum we have and… .”
In a way, it was obvious.
A ten-year veteran of [Dungeon and Stone]?
He knows everything about this game?
What does it matter?
Thinking I’m the only one who knows everything in this world is just arrogance.
The Labyrinth has existed for thousands of years.
It’s not a game world, it’s reality for the people here.
They had to go in to make a living, and there were countless trials and errors.
And that knowledge would have been passed down to future generations through records.
‘True valuable knowledge is likely hoarded by a select few.’
Of course, I’m not overly concerned.
Even in the game, ‘hidden elements’ that were exceptionally difficult to find seemed to be mostly unknown to the people here.
My knowledge as a veteran is still the biggest weapon I have for survival in this world.
Click.
I checked the time on my watch.
[22:37]
It was already past three hours.
Even though the battle was prolonged, the clan members were diligently performing their roles without losing focus.
However…
‘With that much consumables used, it doesn’t matter how much protection fee they collected, it’s meaningless now.’
I suddenly understood why the major clans knew the strategy but didn’t hunt Floor Lords.
The rewards for subjugation aren’t bad…
But the vast amount of resources required.
The possibility of elite members dying.
And the enormous risk they face if they fail.
‘It’s simply not cost-effective.’
I was thinking that when…
Kaboom!!
For some reason, Riakis ignored the warriors and charged towards the center, instantly crushing five ranged dealers.
Something that could happen perfectly naturally during a raid.
Fortunately, the warriors rushed towards Riakis and forced him back to his original position…
But two melee dealers were killed in the process.
‘But they have plenty of time left to hold out.’
I re-analyzed the situation.
Total casualties so far: 11.
It amounted to 20% of their total strength, but the remaining members weren’t panicking and were doing what they had to do.
There might be some gaps, but
It’s not enough to be a fatal blow.
The problem is that there are a bunch of fools around who can’t even understand simple logic.
“This is wrong! You incompetent fools!!”
“Do you know how many people have died?!”
Even if they hadn’t stepped on corrupted ground and fallen into a [Chaos] state, panic broke out among the crowd again.
I understand their psychology, but they’re being ridiculous.
11 casualties.
That’s just counting the clan members, their actual combat power. Countless adventurers who had paid the protection fee had also died whenever Riakis went on a rampage.
‘Their judgment is clouded by the fear of death.’
From my perspective, they were right next to the raid, but they were staring blankly at the scene. That’s their mistake.
But even if I said that, they wouldn’t listen.
“Bjorn, the atmosphere is not good.”
“I know.”
“We should do something—”
“Wait. I’m thinking.”
I looked around as widely as possible.
The clan seemed to be so focused on Riakis that they hadn’t noticed this situation yet.
And then, one man raised his voice, adding fuel to the fire of confusion.
“We can’t just stand here and watch! We have to combine our strength if we want to survive!”
It was Jack Fletcher, the one who had been the first to remove his equipment and pay the protection fee.
“Do you know how many people have died? They can’t protect us. We have to protect ourselves!”
“Right!”
“But we don’t have any equipment…”
“We have to get them back! They broke their promise, didn’t they?”
His incitement drew support from the death squads who had ignored him last time, and the scale grew beyond control.
I muttered briefly,
“Misha, get ready.”
“Get ready? Ready for what?”
“We’re leaving right now.”
This place is a lost cause.
***
I quickly packed my backpack.
As if it was a riot, countless adventurers rushed towards the center where the supplies were piled up.
“Ev, everyone calm down! If you do this, everyone is going to be in danger—”
The clan finally realized what was happening…
But it was too late.
“Don’t be ridiculous!!”
“Give me back my equipment!”
They started pushing aside the clan’s mages and archers, grabbing supplies with greedy eyes.
“Give it back! It’s mine!!”
“Th, there’s no such thing in this situation!”
“Step back now! I’ll attack if you don’t!”
“It doesn’t matter if I die here or there!”
“Don’t hesitate! They’re looters now! Kill them all!”
Seeing them filled with confusion and madness, I finally erased any lingering attachments I had.
“Bjorn… .”
“Stop staring and let’s go.”
“Oh, okay!”
I grabbed Misha and ran towards the opposite side of Riakis.
Soon, the wall of fire that surrounded us blocked our path.
“Th, what are we going to do about this!”
What else?
“We’re going through it.”
Barbarian style, we’ll brute force it.
I’ll probably get burned, but at this point, even if I just spit on it, it’ll heal.
“Yo, you’re serious?!”
Ah, you wouldn’t be, would you.
“Agh! Eek—!”
I scooped up Misha with both arms and lifted her high above my head, as if I was doing a victory cheer. Then I sprinted, instantly clearing the wall of fire, which was probably at least five meters thick.
Sssshh!!
A faint scent of roasting meat.
My skin slightly burned, even piercing my pain resistance.
I asked,
“Misha, are you alright?”
“…Thanks to you, I’m fine. But look ahead!”
I lowered Misha and looked ahead. 
Chaos Spirits were swarming.
But there wasn’t time to take them out one by one.
“Let’s run.”
“Eek! Through them?”
“Do we have another option?”
They were already starting to notice us one by one and moving slowly towards us.
So we ran through them before we drew more aggro.
We needed to get to the other side as quickly as possible, since we didn’t know what was going on there…
‘Damn it.’
We had been sprinting at full speed for about five minutes.
Suddenly, everything went dark.
Complete darkness, where you couldn’t even see an inch in front of you.
“Bjorn, are you there?!”
“I’m here.”
Fortunately, I could hear her voice.
“Wh, what happened?”
Instead of answering, I let out a huge sigh.
There was no need for analysis or anything, the situation was clear.
“Chaos Lord Riakis has successfully absorbed the power of the Source.”
“The [Evil Rift] field effect has been applied to a five-kilometer radius.”
Riakis’s instant-kill, wipe-out move, [Evil Rift].
Apparently, the damn thing ate all the orbs.
