Chapter 93 Player (5)
“Did they properly confiscate the computer that was turned over to the police?”
“Yes, the memories, as well as all related traces have been erased, so there’s no chance of articles appearing like before.”
The old man nodded at the woman’s report and slowly read the documents on his desk.
Documents summarizing a certain man’s life. 
It didn’t take long to read through the contents of a single page.
“He’s tough against misfortune.”
The old man muttered a short observation and continued.
“But that’s all.”
The woman nodded in agreement.
The man’s life was full of ups and downs, to the point where “tough against misfortune” was an understatement. 
However, there were no other noteworthy features. 
His job was average, his education was average, his relationships were average.
Everything was average.
Except for this game.
“It’s utterly incomprehensible.”
That’s why the man feels even more peculiar.
[Dungeon and Stone], the legacy of Auriel Gaviss, is a failure. After much deliberation, everyone came to that conclusion.
There’s no arguing that it best captured the world than any other work… 
But it was impossible to clear.
So it was abandoned five years ago.
“... But now, someone has come along who cleared it. Could it be that it wasn’t a failure after all?”
The old man muttered and shook his head. 
Even if someone did manage to clear it, didn’t everyone agree that there was no guarantee it would produce better results than other works?
His own judgment was right.
But…
“I’m somewhat curious about how it turned out.”
The old man immediately opened his laptop and typed in the man’s name.
[Lee Han-su]
The name of the only player who cleared his legacy, which everyone said was impossible.

[GP Owned: 139,000]
Having sold information on the Floor 1 Layer Lord and Skull Island, I stopped selling information.
There were two reasons. 
First, it took more time than I expected per transaction. 
Because I had no transaction history, the buyers were suspicious of me. 
Well, I answered a few questions, and they both trusted me enough to buy information… 
It’s not that they fully trusted me, but that they trusted this community.
Because if I dared to try to scam them and got kicked out of the community, I wouldn’t be able to come back in.
And second.
Actually, this was the biggest reason, even more than time.
‘If I just keep selling everything I can, it’s bound to attract attention.’ 
There’s a saying that a protruding rock gets hit the hardest.
I want to avoid attracting any attention, whoever it may be.
I don’t need GP desperately right now either— 
BING!
A message arrived at that moment.
[Sender: Ghost Master.]
A nickname I’d seen a few times in the announcements.
In other words, a message from the community administrator.
My heart sank like a thief caught red-handed, but it turned out to be nothing special.
[Elfnunna’s transaction record exceeds 10 times. EXP +10]
[Member Rank Adjusted]
[Deadman -> Goblin.]
An automated message sent as a result of my community rank being raised.
There aren’t any major benefits to having a higher rank, but it can’t hurt.
Because sometimes there are chat rooms with rank restrictions.
TAP, TAP, TAP.
I first posted a question using the GP I had.
The GP offered as a reward was 100,000 to 1 million.
It was a declaration of my willingness to pay that much for valuable information.
[Transaction Post Registered.]
After registration, I spent time browsing the community like surfing the web.
When I saw the jokes and humor posts going back and forth in the free board, it felt like I had returned to the original world.
That was when.
‘100,000 points for 2 million stones?’
I learned the real-world value of GP while browsing the marketplace.
My current GP holdings were about 140,000.
‘Crazy, that means I earned 2.8 million stones just by answering two questions?’
My jaw dropped at first, but upon reflection, it wasn’t something I couldn’t understand. It wasn’t like the information I sold was worthless.
‘I could sit on a mountain of money just by selling information here!’
I suddenly thought, ‘Is there even a reason to enter the maze anymore?’
But…
‘Don’t think like that.’
The act of converting GP into money still feels dangerous to me.
‘Let’s not be greedy and use this place strictly for obtaining information.’
I made a new rule and resolved myself.
That was when I was browsing the community.
BING!
An alert sound was heard.
I checked the monitor, and a new message had arrived.
[Elfnunalove requests a 1:1 chat.]
Elfnunalove.
It was a kind of creepy nickname for me, but I accepted without hesitation.
Because there was only one reason anyone would contact me.
‘I was worried, but they showed up before the end of the day.’
The information seller had finally appeared. 
***
A study with a classic interior.
I was slightly surprised to smell the faint aroma of books.
‘This is really nicely decorated. How much did they spend on this?’
It was a different dimension from the vacant lot, which was the background for the newbie room, or the desolate field where I would base my interactions.
It must have cost a considerable amount of GP.
But I don’t think it was a waste of money.
‘Indeed, this alone creates a certain level of trust…’
After briefly looking around, I spotted the white man and greeted him.
“Hello.”
“Yes, hello. You’re Elfnunna, right? Please have a seat.”
I sat down, and the man immediately got to the point. 
“You want to know about Tartein School, a mage named Shernell Fergan, right?”
“That’s right.”
If I only asked about the dimensional collapse phenomenon, it would be difficult for me to tell whether the other person was lying or not.
But it’s different if I ask about Shernell Fergan. 
Like this.
“To be precise, I want to know more about what he’s been doing recently.”
“Hmm, is it because of rumors about the dimensional collapse phenomenon?”
The man immediately linked the name Shernell Fergan to the dimensional collapse the moment I said it.
This raises the reliability of the information to come.
So I asked frankly. 
“Is that rumor true?”
The man asked for 20,000 GP in exchange for an answer, and after I agreed, he continued.
“Are you asking if those words came from his mouth? Yes, that’s right. But if you’re asking about the truth of the rumors… it’s not.”
“What do you mean?”
The man took a moment to organize his thoughts and said bluntly, “The dimensional collapse phenomenon isn’t happening.”
“What’s your evidence for saying that?”
“It’s a story involving high-ranking officials and political power struggles… ”
In other words, it’s high-level information that’s too expensive to give away for 20,000 GP.
“I’ll give you another 20,000 GP.”
“If you’re so eager to hear it.”
The man nodded and continued without hesitation.
“The Tartein School focuses on the study of mazeology, specifically the study of dimensional magic. And the master of the school wanted to conduct an experiment.”
“Experiment…?”
“I can’t go into details, but it’s not a dangerous experiment. It’s just that they want fewer explorers entering the maze than usual.” 
So the Tartein School spread rumors through their own mages.
They figured that if rumors of a dimensional collapse spread, it would discourage explorers who are easily swayed by superstition.
“... Are you allowed to tell me these things?”
“It wasn’t that I was freely spreading rumors, but that I was selling them for GP, right?”
His confident attitude left me speechless.
The man smirked and continued, “Does it even matter to me in the first place? I’m not the master of that school. Besides, the royal family will soon be posting an official notice denying the rumors on a grand scale.”
“... The royal family?”
“Would the Rafdonia Royal Family just stand by? If there are fewer explorers, it means fewer stones will be collected.”
Well, that’s true, too.
I continued to listen for a short while, and the story made perfect sense. The reasons he presented were all convincing, and he didn’t seem to be lying.
I was about to complete the transaction and told him that I would send the remaining 20,000 GP separately, but the man shook his head.
“Come to think of it, I’ll pass on that. You seem like a fan of his.”
20,000 GP would be 400,000 stones, and he’s refusing to accept it because he’s a fan of the same person…
I thanked him, but I was curious. 
How many years has this guy been playing for? 
‘5 years? 10 years?’
Whatever it was, one thing was for sure.
He’s firmly established in this world, to the point where 400,000 stones don’t matter to him.
‘That’s why he knows all the ins and outs of information that I wouldn’t have known even if I’d worked for days and nights.’
My initial resolve was renewed.
15 times? 20 times? 30 times? Or even 100 times?
Well, whatever mode they cleared, it wasn’t something I should be worried about.
This is not a world inside a game.
This is the harsh reality of the survival of the fittest, where ruthless principles rule.
‘Little Balkan or whatever, in the end, I’m still a newbie here…’
I realized that the path I’ve traveled so far is nothing compared to the road still ahead.
But why?
It’s only been a moment since I renewed my resolve. 
‘It’s interesting.’
The man who bought the Floor 1 Layer Lord strategy.
The woman who wanted information about Skull Island.
This man standing before me, the place where he reached after years of playing.
A smirk.
I didn’t feel for a moment that I couldn’t reach it. 
***
A black DOS screen.
After a brief loading, a beep sounds and the log containing the player’s history fills the monitor.
BEEP, BEEP BEEP, BEEP-
The rules of the log are simple. 
It only records actions here. 
Therefore… 
「Completed the Coming-of-Age Ceremony without incident.」
「Equipped new gear.」
He chose a shield at the Coming-of-Age Ceremony.
「Character stepped on a goblin trap.」
He got into trouble immediately upon entering the maze. 
He stepped on a goblin trap and spent hours crawling on the ground in a bleeding state.
He killed a person on his first day.
He befriended an elf he met by chance.
And, starting with nothing but his bare hands, he reached the second floor on his first entry.
“Crazy bastard.”
The old man was dumbfounded as he read through the log. This was even more so because it was a log that only recorded actions.
Because every action has a reason.
The old man, who had seen many player logs, could see the reasons behind the judgments this guy made at every moment. 
He had to.
That was the right choice.
So this guy carried it out.
As if he were truly playing a game. 
It was truly amazing.
How many players have been lost in the disconnect between the game and reality and made illogical choices?
“... How many people have reached the second floor on their first entry?”
“As far as I know, it’s 117.”
117.
It’s a lot to say it’s a small number.
But the old man was certain.
Among those 117 players, there wouldn’t have been a single one who had faced such a combination of bad luck.
‘He’s an odd fellow.’
The old man continued to scroll down and read the log, but then he froze at one point. 
「Slayed Vampire Duke Cambormier. EXP +5」
「Upper Tier Variant Slayer Bonus. EXP +1」
「Guardian Slayer Bonus. EXP +3」
「The character’s soul is imbued with [Vampire Essence – Guardian]….」
The log on the screen had reached recent times.
「Bjorn Jandel」
Level: 3 (New +1)
Body: 155 (New +75) / Mind: 90 (New +44) / Ability: 115 (New +85)
Item Level: 98 (New -104)
Overall Combat Index: 381.5 (New +204)
Acquired Essence: Corpse Golem - Rank 7 Vampire (Guardian) - Rank 5 (New)
It’s hard to believe this is a character from just a few years of play.
He achieved this in just two months since waking up in an unfamiliar body. 
Of course, there would have been some luck involved.
But…
‘If it were possible just by luck, there would have been at least one similar case.’
The old man raised the player’s surveillance level to the maximum. 
That’s how statistics work.
As the sample size and data accumulate, the number of possibilities decreases, and uncertain information turns into clearer facts. Through this process, the derived ‘probability’ is surprisingly accurate, with almost no margin of error regardless of how much the sample size increases.
In other words, the variable of ‘luck’ in statistics is extremely minimal. 
However, there are occasional cases like these.
First.
The impossible becomes possible. 
In simpler terms, zero becomes one.
An irregular, beyond statistics, where the causal factors can’t even be determined because there is no comparison sample.
CLICK, CLICK. 
「Abnormal growth rate.」
「Administrator is watching the character.」
He suddenly had a thought.
When everyone agreed it was a failure,
The last words he left behind.
[I simply made rational judgments. Even if it was only one person in a lifetime, if I could successfully complete it, that would be more promising.]
Maybe he was right.
