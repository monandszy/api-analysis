Chapter 85: Baron Martoang (1)
When I emerged from the sewers, I was greeted by the setting sun and two familiar faces.
“Bjorn! You’re safe!”
“Shavin? Why are you here?”
“Why am I here? You didn’t return with the report after hours, so I came to check on you!”
Ah, I see.
It’s kind of you to come looking for me.
But…
“Both of you?”
If something had truly happened to us, wouldn’t it be reasonable to send another adventurer after daybreak?
Rather than assembling a party consisting of an administrative clerk and a librarian.
“What’s with that look? How skilled a magician is Ragna!”
Only then did I properly examine the librarian who came along.
Her appearance was definitely different from the one I saw at the library.
“Hmm.”
A gleaming robe.
Scrolls and potions hung from her belt.
And she was holding a rather expensive-looking magic staff in her hand.
I don’t know how skilled she is, but it’s clear that her equipment is beyond the reach of a typical librarian’s salary.
Was she actually rich?
“Bjorn, who are these people?”
“Shavin Emuer. He’s the administrator who assigned me this mission. And this is… Ragna Ritaniel Peprok.”
“It’s Ritaniel, not Ritaniel!”
“Anyway, she’s the librarian from the library I used to go to.”
“Hee, I see.”
After introducing them briefly, with Misha leading, I uttered a formal greeting.
“I’m sorry to have brought you out here this late.”
“No need to apologize.”
“Then thank you. I never thought you would come all this way.”
“…Thank Shavin. I was simply caught in the crossfire.”
The librarian said that and turned her head sharply.
Why does she seem colder than usual today?
Just as I thought it might be my imagination, Shavin grinned and clung to her.
“Ragna, caught in the crossfire? You were really worried.”
“Worried? When was I ever worried!”
“You said you might get lost because the sewer routes are complex.”
“Shavin, stop twisting things. I was merely stating a possibility. It’s also because it wouldn’t be a big deal.”
“Hmm, was it?”
Shavin smirked as he watched the flustered librarian. Just from that, I could tell what kind of relationship they had.
Well, that’s not important right now.
“Enough chatter, I’m going to give my report.”
I need to move quickly if I want to go back to my lodgings and rest before the end of the day.
***
The results of my sewer patrol were simple.
One vagrant discovered and killed, nothing else unusual.
There’s no evidence that I completed the mission properly because the video recorder was destroyed…
But I’m glad I brought my identity card.
“Hans Marcom. I remember him. He was wanted for robbery and murder, but he was a fugitive. I’ll pay you 180,000 stones, including the bonus for the mission. Just visit the administrative office tomorrow and you’ll be paid immediately.”
“Are you not going to ask me to pay for the destroyed video recorder?”
“Well… I’ll talk to the higher-ups about it and try to resolve it. I’m sure they’ll approve. You had such a special experience this time, right?”
“Special experience…”
That’s not exactly wrong, but I didn’t expect them to be so considerate about that.
However, rather than saying the administration is a more flexible organization than the guild, it’s probably more accurate to say that Shavin is being kind to me.
“The twilight star will guide us…”
After waiting for a while, someone arrived from the temple Shavin contacted.
Not a regular priest…
A paladin with a terrifying greatsword strapped to his back. After carefully examining the corpse we showed him, he nodded.
“It is indeed the heretic Elisa Behenk. The Order will never forget your contribution.”
His voice was kind, without arrogance, and I even felt respect for us.
But never forget?
Isn’t that a bit vague?
“Contribution, you mean the bounty?”
I asked directly, as befits a barbarian who doesn’t know how to be hypocritical.
The paladin just gave a friendly smile.
“You’re mistaken. The bounty is from the Adventurer’s Guild.”
“You mean if we hand it over to you, we won’t receive the money?”
“Haha, I will send a letter to the guild tomorrow, so don’t worry about that.”
“…I see.”
Come on, make people feel awkward.
You should have said that from the beginning.
“Hey, Paladin? I lost my memory while fighting that woman earlier… Can you check if there’s anything else wrong with us?”
“Of course.”
The paladin then cast [High Purification] on each of us before leaving. He said we needed to take the body to the temple quickly, right?
“We’ll be on our way too. I’ll have to write a lot of reports tomorrow, so I need to get some sleep.”
The same was true for Shavin and the librarian.
Since it was late, we all left as soon as we were done.
Well, have I finished everything I need to do for now?
“Let’s talk about the bounty tomorrow.”
“Ugh, finally going home!”
“You smell worse than when you came back from the labyrinth! Hahahaha!”
We dispersed and headed to our respective lodgings.
It was 11:30 PM when we arrived.
I wanted to rest immediately, but I went straight to the bathroom and scrubbed my body for a long time to wash off the filth.
Only then, when I lay down on the bed, did it feel real.
‘What a tough day.’
I don’t know why I feel this way after completing a 150,000-stone mission…
But I survived again.
***
The next morning, we all gathered to receive our bounty at the guild.
Fortunately, the paladin had processed things quickly, and we received the bounty just by showing our identity cards.
By the way, the amount was…
“Ten million stones! It’s unbelievable! Hahaha!”
Even split five ways, it’s a huge sum of two million stones each.
The faces of those who had grumbled about the sewer smell this morning were now beaming with joy.
“Now I see, Bjorn, you’re a lucky charm! I feel like money is raining down from the sky ever since I met you!”
Yeah, you’d feel that way.
Because I was the one whose head was cracked open by that psychopath.
Even Rotmiller added his two cents.
“…I don’t believe in superstition, but at this point, I have no choice but to believe. Bjorn, there’s no doubt that the goddess of fortune is with you on your journey.”
I know it’s meant as praise, but it doesn’t feel good to hear.
Why is it that my hard work, my struggles, are attributed to some nonexistent goddess?
“I’m going to leave now.”
“Huh? Where are you going? We should have a drink.”
“I also have to go to the administration.”
“Ah, they asked you to come for the mission fee. We’ll drink, so go and come back soon.”
Hm, they didn’t even say they’d come with me, even as a polite gesture.
“Bjorn! Should I come with you?”
“No, you worked hard yesterday, go get some rest.”
“Hmm, okay.”
After the bounty distribution, I went straight to the administration.
A five-story building that reminded me of the Seoul Station government building.
I climbed the stairs to the facilities management department on the third floor and easily found Shavin.
“Bjorn! You’ve arrived!”
As always, Shavin was wearing a uniform-style outfit. However, since everyone wore the same clothes, it didn’t stand out.
Or rather, is it me who stands out?
“Hey, that’s the little Balcan?”
“I heard he gets incredibly large when he uses his ability… ”
“What are you all talking about! Oh my, how scandalous… ”
Is this an all-female workplace?
As soon as I entered the facilities management department, there was a flurry of excited whispers.
I felt like a monkey in a cage.
I decided to leave as soon as I finished my business.
“Here, just sign this payment confirmation. If you don’t have a registered signature, just write your name.”
“Sure.”
I received the money and signed the document.
Just as I turned to leave, Shavin stopped me and said something.
“Oh! Right! If you have time, please visit the library.”
“The library?”
“Ragna, that girl, is so thoughtful that she prepared something for you, Bjorn.”
She did that?
Looking at his playful eyes, I knew I should filter what he said…
“Alright, I’ll visit when I have time.”
“Yes! Definitely! ”
It seems like she has a reason to call me, so I should probably visit.
***
After leaving the administration, I returned to the tavern where the others were.
As expected, it was a mess.
It was still daytime, so I thought they would be a little more restrained.
“No way, it’s true! Hahahahahaha!”
“Don’t lie, Dwarf-forgetful! How can a person’s name be Dick Johnson… Nyahaha! Nyahahahaha!”
The dwarf and Misha were drunk, chatting and laughing, while Dwarlki was face down on the table, giggling by himself.
“Kkuk, I am, the great magician Reol Warve Dwarlki…”
I sighed as I watched the scene, and Rotmiller greeted me politely.
“Ah, you’re here. How’s it going? Anything interesting?”
“That’s something I should be asking you. Why are you already in this state?”
“We just made a lot of easy money, didn’t we? Everyone seems to be in good spirits.”
“…I see.”
I replied and approached Misha.
Then I grabbed the beer mug she was holding, lifted her by the neck, and pulled her up.
“Aagh! Who… Who is… Bjorn? When did you get here?”
“I just arrived. And stop drinking.”
“Eeek! Are you our dad?”
Misha looked at me with disgust and resisted.
I was about to say something before she burst into laughter.
“Ah! That’s right! Our dad wouldn’t care about this. Nyahahahahaha!”
…This girl is really in a bad state today.
Ugh, I was going to relax today.
“Whatever, just drink this if you’re bored.”
“Okay.”
I couldn’t let her get any drunker, so I ordered tomato juice and gave it to her to drink, then sat down next to her.
It doesn’t matter about the dwarf, but if she gets so drunk that she can’t walk, I’ll have to take her home.
I’m the only one going in the same direction.
“Hahaha! You two are so weird! There’s something going on! There’s something going on!”
“Stop talking nonsense and drink some water if you’re drunk.”
“Khahaha, you’re still young. Does this look like beer to you? To me, it’s just water! Water!”
“…Do whatever you want.”
I decided to ignore the dwarf and ordered some food to fill my stomach.
As I was eating, Misha, seemingly sobered up a bit, started fidgeting and staring at me.
“Do… you have something to say?”
“I do!”
Her immediate reply made me nervous.
But I nodded anyway.
“…Go on.”
Misha slapped her flushed cheeks twice, took a deep breath, and opened her mouth.
“My dad wanted to bring you—”
“Oh! Who is this? Isn’t this Bjorn, the son of Yandel!”
“Huh? Who’s that?”
A man called out to me in a loud voice, interrupting Misha.
I recognized him.
“You…”
“You’ve forgotten my name already? It’s Hans! Hans Hoji!”
“…That’s right.”
I remembered his name immediately, but I was confused about the order.
This guy with a skinny, dried fish body and freckles, his Hans code is B.
By the way, I met him by chance at the tavern when Einar left the party. He even advised me to go to the guild if I wanted to find my comrades.
‘But why is this guy talking to me?’
Maybe I’ve met so many Hanses since then?
As soon as he spoke, I started to feel uneasy.
I had a bad feeling, like something awful was going to happen.
“Can I sit down?”
“No, I have nothing to talk to you about.”
“Hmm, it’s a coincidence we met—”
“I’m going to get up soon. So leave.”
“Well, I was just happy to see you… ”
I was building a wall around myself to avoid getting tangled up with him, and Hans B left dejectedly.
I felt like I had overcome a hurdle, though there was no evidence for it.
That’s when it happened.
Bang!
The door on the first floor opened, and a group of knights bearing the same family crest on their chests entered the tavern.
“Mozlan!”
Mozlan.
One of the city’s highest military organizations, only accessible to “knights” of noble birth.
“Why are they in this kind of backwater tavern…?”
They’re infamous for their “capture and death” methods. As soon as they entered, everyone’s attention turned to them.
The tavern, now filled with static.
“Over there.”
The commander gave an order, and the knights moved in unison towards a specific spot.
Unfortunately, it was in my direction.
‘Damn it.’
What’s going on this time?
I started to retrace my recent actions, wondering if I had made any mistakes.
[Always be wary of those who have many grudges, wherever they may be.]
I suddenly remembered what the tribal shaman said when he read my fortune.
Also, I remembered Hans B, who stayed close to me in the hallway as we were returning to our rooms.
‘Wait, those who have many grudges… ’
Could he have been talking about Hanses?
I haven’t really had a good time when I’ve been involved with them…
That’s when my thoughts reached that point.
Click.
The knights stopped in front of our table.
And they looked at us, speaking in a deep, commanding voice.
I froze, holding the fork in my hand.
“Reol Warve Dwarlki, you are under arrest for insulting a noble.”
Surprisingly, it wasn’t me this time.
