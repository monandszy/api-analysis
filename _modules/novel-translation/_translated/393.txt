## Captain Barbarian (3)
Thud.
As I finished speaking and settled into my seat, a brief silence descended upon the dining hall. It was only natural. After all, each person had been vying for the leadership position, asserting their own qualifications. I could easily guess how my words would be received.
“Are you saying you’re stronger than us?”
The aristocratic knight’s question, laced with unease, was clear in his stern demeanor. I chuckled and replied, “You’ve understood correctly.”
I felt no need to deny it. I hadn’t spoken falsehoods, after all.
“…….”
To my bold answer, the surroundings remained surprisingly quiet. The knight, though seemingly itching to retort, seemed to hold back, perhaps out of consideration for the marquis sitting beside him.
Glancing sideways, my eyes met the marquis’s.  Instead of the disgust I anticipated, he simply looked at me with gleaming eyes, clearly intrigued.
Well, what about the others? I swept my gaze across the room and noticed a myriad of different expressions directed toward me.
“I only hope your prowess matches half your arrogance.  A skilled warrior is always welcome.”
The aristocratic knight’s gaze was brimming with hostility, stemming from his displeasure.
“Ho ho, young men of that age are all the same. Why, I find it quite charming.”
Her tone was light, but her eyes betrayed her disdain. That was the dwarf woman’s viewpoint.
“Riehen Schweiz. I’ve heard of him. They call him the Blood-Spirit Knight’s man, don’t they?”
The Geartooth Clan’s deputy leader, scrutinizing me with intense curiosity, as if dissecting me.
“…….”
The Tobera Church’s holy knight, Jun, stared at me with eyes devoid of any discernible emotion.  Was it a sign of indifference? I couldn’t quite tell, but the attention directed at me began to scatter, replaced by a mutual exploration of each other’s gazes.
Now that introductions were over, they would start their assessments.  Who among them posed the greatest threat to their claim to leadership.
“This should be a joyous occasion, but the mood seems a bit tense.  We’ve all exchanged introductions, so let’s enjoy some food.”
The marquis timely intervention diffused the tension, and everyone resumed their conversations over dinner.  Of course, it wasn’t a particularly jovial atmosphere.
“As you all know, one of us will stand at the helm, leading us all.  As you’re aware, it’s a position of immense responsibility.”
A position that demanded safeguarding the lives of thirty individuals. However, no one present was ignorant of the substantial benefits that came with it. Even I had been promised generous support by the marquis.
“So, what are you trying to say, Kailslan?  That we’re unworthy?”
The dwarf woman, in her gentle voice, made it clear that she had no intention of relinquishing her claim to the position.
“Ahem, I merely wanted to ascertain if you fully grasp the significance of the role.”
The knight, seemingly disappointed, licked his lips, clearly viewing her as his primary competitor.
“Ha ha, I believe I understand. I, too, had to shoulder countless responsibilities and obligations in my ascent to the deputy leader position.”
Seizing the opportunity, the deputy leader subtly touted his credentials.  What a nerve war.
“To be blunt, Jun, are you harboring aspirations for this position?”
“There’s nothing more fleeting than human emotion.  All things are at the will of the gods.”
His words, though seemingly implying a stance of detachment, could also be interpreted as an acceptance of his participation in the competition. The knight’s expression brightened, but only until the holy knight interjected.
“However, it seems that I, among us, stand closest to the divine will.”
His words, despite the grand declarations of gods and divine will, ultimately amounted to a statement of intent to join the competition.  Perhaps due to his connection to the Trisha Church, the knight’s expression grew clouded with deeper anxieties.  He clearly considered him a formidable adversary…
“Indeed.”
What’s with this?  Why didn’t he ask me?  How rude.
***
After the seemingly endless barrage of veiled hostilities, the knight, with a resolute glint in his eyes, nodded and took charge of the conversation.
“There are many who desire it, but only one position available.  Ultimately, we must determine who amongst us is most suited for the role.”
“Oh, so you have a method in mind?”
“Let us start by each outlining our ideal leader.”
In simpler terms, he suggested that they delve into their personalities and desires.
“Fine by me.  I have no objections.”
The knight’s proposal was met with enthusiastic agreement from the dwarf woman and the deputy leader.  Jun and I, seeing no reason to oppose, allowed the proceedings to continue.
“It was I who brought up the topic, so I’ll go first.”
As expected, it was the knight who, from the outset, enjoyed being the center of attention, stepping forward.  With the confidence of a seasoned soldier, he declared in a booming voice:
“A collective, by its nature, can only reach its full potential when it acts as one.  In my opinion, the most crucial quality for a leader is the ability to command.”
“That’s rather abstract.  What exactly do you mean by the ability to command?”
“It is the power to establish and uphold order.  Control starts there.  Perfectly disciplined troops, without deviation, will march toward their designated objectives.”
I could already envision him as a leader.  A rigid individual, interfering in every detail, crushing the freedom and individuality of his followers.
He continued his impassioned speech, elaborating on the kind of organization he aimed to build and its advantages.  After what seemed like an eternity, he finally concluded.
“That’s my ideal.”
The instant the knight’s turn ended, the dwarf woman seized the opportunity to speak next.
“I heard you loud and clear.  Now, let me share my thoughts.”
Unlike the knight’s overly rigid approach, this woman’s words were quite intriguing.  She was a top explorer, after all.  What would she prioritize?
“From time immemorial, problems in the labyrinth have been solved by explorers.  Historically, the involvement of armies has been extremely rare. Why is that?”
“It’s because the royal family respects the explorers’ methods.”
“That may be part of it, but the real reason is that it’s more efficient from the royal family’s standpoint.  Within the labyrinth, anything is possible.  They need individuals capable of dealing with any situation, and that’s where explorers come in.  It’s simply too disadvantageous to deploy hundreds, even thousands, of soldiers in the labyrinth.”
“So, Akraba, are you saying an ideal leader is an explorer?”
“That’s not quite it. I just believe that if someone is to lead within the labyrinth, that person needs a profound knowledge and experience of the labyrinth, along with the judgment to react proactively.”
Akraba’s qualifications were indeed highly plausible.  Honestly, I’d feel far safer under her command than under that knight’s.  While her statement wasn’t completely flawless, it still held merit.
“With all due respect, Akraba, don’t you lack any leadership experience?”
Akraba’s brow furrowed at the deputy leader’s question. It seemed she hadn’t expected her junior to use such tactics after initially expressing his admiration.
However, even as she glared, the deputy leader finished his statement.
“Even during our team activities, I recall you leading all aspects of the operations.”
“….. I have previous leadership experience.”
“Interesting. However, leading a small team is vastly different from commanding a large group of thirty individuals.”
Man, what a hypocrite.  Then again, it’s funny to talk about morals in a business meeting.
“Anyway, I’m done.  James Kalla, your turn next.”
“I wouldn’t miss it for the world.”
The deputy leader, having subtly dissed Akraba, proceeded to present his ideal qualities for a leader.
“In my opinion, the most important asset for a leader is information.  Akraba said it herself: one must be able to react proactively in any situation.”
“So?”
“With prior information, it’s possible to avoid those situations entirely.  And even if you do encounter a crisis, you’ll have a wider range of options.”
The deputy leader, perhaps with the aim of undermining Akraba, pointedly looked at her before continuing.
His act was so over the top, it was ridiculous.
“Well, that’s certainly not a wrong statement. If you possess that level of information, that is.”
Akraba retorted with more irritation than usual, and the deputy leader, as if waiting for this response, immediately spoke up.
“I’m backed by the Alminus Trading House and the Explorer’s Guild. Of course, that doesn’t mean I know everything about the world, but… ”
“…….”
“At least, my ears are the sharpest amongst us.”
Akraba couldn’t retort.  If the Alminus Trading House and the Explorer’s Guild were his patrons, he could gather information exceeding even the royal family’s resources, at least within the labyrinth. 
He might be weak in terms of top-level intelligence, though.
“That concludes my remarks. Who’s next?”
“I shall go.”
It was Jun’s turn after the deputy leader, and he began his sermon, almost like a priest conducting a service.
“All things begin with faith, and that includes leadership. Strong faith and trust will instill courage that will not falter in the face of any evil….”
Man, this guy sure does talk a lot.
“The world is filled with trials. Some overcome them, while others succumb and lose their faith. But do you know?”
His eyes shone with an intensity I hadn’t seen before.  Initially, I’d mistaken him for a stoic fellow.
“Those who have always overcome trials have been those who held onto their faith. Only faith can bind people together, and only that united faith can save us in the midst of adversity.”
Whew, repeating the same thing over and over with such elaborate wordiness just gets tiring.
“Ahem….”
I couldn’t help but yawn.  Jun, with a tightly closed mouth, glared at me.
“My discourse on faith seems to bore you.”
No, it’s just boring, okay?  With a look that implied “What did you expect?”, I stared back at Jun, his brow furrowing.
“Well, why don’t you speak?  Your turn, I presume.”
Jun was about to relinquish his turn, when the others showed their eagerness.
“Yes, that’s a good idea.  I was curious.”
They, too, seemed tired of his faith-related drivel.
“Riehen Schweiz, what kind of leader do you think should lead?”
The deputy leader asked me.  His voice held a subtle hint of addressing a voter rather than a competitor.
No, it’s not just him.
“Given your personality, I’d say you’d want a strong, controlling leader.”
The knight threw in his two cents, subtly touting himself.
“Maybe if you were a soldier.  As an explorer, I’m sure you understand how crucial what I said is.”
Akraba quickly jumped in as the knight stepped up.
I couldn’t help but laugh.  Why do they expect me to agree with them? I’d already made it abundantly clear.
“…Why are you laughing?”
Of course.
“I find it funny that you’re wasting time arguing about who’s the most suitable.  Honestly, what are you trying to convince us of?”
I’d been diligently chewing on meat throughout their impassioned speeches, and now, I finished my meal, wiping the sauce from my hand.
And then…
“It’s simple. Whoever wins gets the position.”
I slammed the cup I’d just finished down on the table.
The impact reverberated through the dining hall.  However, no one flinched.
“Ah… I had a feeling this would happen.”
“So, Schweiz, are you saying that ‘power’ is your goal?”
Their eyes held a hint of contempt.  They’re all putting on a facade.  Or maybe they just lack imagination.
“It seems you’re a fool, clinging to your meager power.  Do you really think you can convince us with that?”
“Yeah.”
“A true leader cannot be achieved through power alone… what?”
“Is there any reason you wouldn’t be convinced?”
I’m well-fed, ready for some exercise.
“Stop talking, and fight.”
I leapt to my feet, and the knight who’d been meeting my gaze panicked.  He looked like he was wondering if he could even do this in front of the marquis.
“I’m not going to interfere with whatever method you choose.”
The marquis, having decided to leave this matter to me, entirely deferred to my decision.
“That’s how it is, then.”
I shrugged. The dwarf woman, sneering, piped up.
“Even if you defeat him, it won’t change anything.  If someone who relies solely on force assumes that position, then—“
What’s this old woman talking about?
“Would you have been convinced with any other words?”
I explained the fundamental reason I’d dismissed their grand declarations as a waste of time.
I met the eyes of each individual and said, “Strong control. Judgment based on experience. Extensive information gathering abilities. And trust.”
All the qualities of a leader they’d mentioned earlier.
“Yes, none of those are bad.”
I meant that. But there’s a big problem with all that.
“But even if you talk about it all day, are there any people who would be convinced that he’d be a good leader?”
What everyone wants cannot be obtained through consensus. Even more so if you’re trying to sell them on such intangible values.
However…
“Are you saying you’re different?”
“Yeah.”
Power is different.
“So, fight.”
“Don’t be a fool. Even if you were to actually defeat him —“
They won’t accept you. I know that.
But…
“Who said it had to be one?”
My life as a barbarian has taught me this.  If brute force cannot secure the agreement of your opponents, it’s because…
“All of you.”
Their strength is inadequate.
“……?”
I grinned at the four individuals whose minds seemed unable to keep up.
“All of you, fight together.”
There’s no mage amongst them.
