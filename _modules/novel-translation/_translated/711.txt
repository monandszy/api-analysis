## Special Forces (2)
The possibility of an inside man among the noble families.  This wasn't just a casual remark, I meant it. You can't truly know a person's heart, and among hundreds of noble families, it wouldn't be surprising if one of them had ulterior motives.
"Are you sure you want to go to the Duke's house?"
"Yes, the Duke himself could be the inside man."
Of course, that was just a throwaway comment.  The Duke wasn't crazy; he essentially acts as the king's representative, wielding immense power in the kingdom.  Why would he align himself with them?
The possibility seemed incredibly low.
"Hmm… but it's not completely impossible, right?"
Frankly, I couldn't entirely dismiss it.  The Duke, that bastard, has more than a few suspicious aspects.  He harbors secrets. This was the chance to search his house.
"Can... can I use the restroom for a minute?"
Ah, I knew it. He's trying to sneak away to contact someone...
"No."
"But, I really need to go."
"Is relieving yourself more urgent than saving this nation?"
"..."
As usual, 'nation' silenced Mu-mu, leaving him speechless.
"Just go in your pants."
"..."
That settled the restroom issue.
However, he was showing signs of trying to escape, so I prepared a countermeasure.
"Raven."
"Yes?"
"I heard there's a magic that disrupts communication with the outside, even while moving. Can you use it?"
"Not over a wide area unless you have a supporting magical artifact. Around 3 meters in radius."
"What about blocking only outbound communication, not inbound?"
"Hmm, that would let me cover a larger area."
Oh, really?
"Do it now. This mission is top secret."
Raven immediately cast the spell, effectively cutting off Mu-mu's ability to contact anyone outside.  He stared at me, stiff and awkward, then forced a smile.
"What are you laughing at? Let's go."
After inspecting the special forces unit's security, we headed straight for the Duke's mansion.
Predictably, Raven stuck right next to Mu-mu, even though I hadn't instructed her.
"Wouldn't it be better to walk by Baron Yandel?"
"No, I'm comfortable here. Why should I move?"
"..."
He should just give up and follow, but he stubbornly persisted.
Such people rarely live long.  I mean, why would a lizard abandon its tail when every bit of it is precious?
"..."
As Mu-mu fell silent, the other members started whispering among themselves.
Their concerns were simple.
"Is this really alright?"
"Then you try stopping him."
"But… Baron Yandel does have a point. It's the Chancellor's unit, so we don't need to worry about repercussions…"
"What are you saying! We're about to ransack the Chancellor's home!"
"Ah, right. It is that."
"..."
"If this goes wrong, we'll all end up in court, won't we?"
They were deeply uncomfortable about raiding the home of the Duke, who was practically the ruler of Raphdonia.
However…
"Let's go anyway. What else can we do?"
"Right..."
They understood the old saying 'the barbarians are closer than the law'.  They murmured their anxieties but took no action.
"Baron Yandel, what brings you here…?"
We arrived at the Duke's mansion. The head butler, a face I'd grown quite familiar with, greeted me with a perplexed expression.
"I haven't received any notice from the Duke.  Unless you have an appointment…"
"I'm not here as Baron Yandel today."
"..."
"Today, I'm the leader of the Special Search Unit, part of the Military Command."
When I revealed my new identity, the butler looked even more confused. It was understandable.  He had no idea what the 'Special Search Unit' was, and…
"The Special Search Unit…  What brings you here…?"
He couldn't even fathom it.  Living as the head butler of the Duke's mansion, where even tigers would bow to a mere puff of his breath, had stunted his imagination.
"The reason we're here is simple."
"..."
"We're going to do a quick search."
"..."
The butler remained speechless, but I ignored him and walked inside.
Some of the soldiers hesitated to follow, but I had no patience for their reluctance.
"What are you waiting for? Get in!"
"..."
They hurriedly followed me, and the Duke's soldiers, who'd been wary initially, stood awkwardly in our way.  However, did they perhaps remember the last time we caused a ruckus here?
"Baron, I… We… You shouldn't be here."
"If the Duke knew about this…"
They seemed more inclined to solve the situation through words rather than resorting to force.
If they could solve it with words, I wouldn't have come here.
"I'm Baron Yandel, leader of the Special Search Unit, part of the Military Command! Move aside!  If you obstruct us or interfere with our mission, you'll be considered a traitor in league with the Noarks and dealt with accordingly!"
I wasn't intimidated by the Duke's name, despite being the one intruding.  I met their hesitation with bold assertiveness, leaving the butler and the soldiers flustered.
Did something happen? Did I know something?
They were all frozen, unsure what to do, when…
"Some of you are smart."
A few of the soldiers, with sharper judgement than the others, charged at me.
"This is the mansion of the Duke Terselion, Chancellor of this nation!"
"It is my duty to protect this mansion."
"Woooaahhh!!"
Of course, they were all knocked out with a swift punch to the face the moment they attacked.
One might think they'd have been better off just standing there if they were going to be knocked out so easily, but I actually respected them.
Because, if you can't stop something anyway, it's better to fight and be knocked out.  At least you'll keep your job, unlike those clueless fools.
"Oo…."
"Oo…"
The soldiers retreated with each step I took.
Watching them, I wondered how many people would be jobless at the Duke's mansion after I left.  But it was none of my concern.
Where are there any lifetime jobs in this day and age?
"Sir… Sir… Sir, you really entered the mansion…"
My soldiers, having entered the mansion behind me, trembled, worried about the consequences.
It was time to showcase my leadership.
"Don't worry. I'll take responsibility for everything.  You'll be safe."
A hero who keeps every word he speaks.  A warrior among warriors, incapable of lies. 
Thanks to my reputation, my soldiers' faces lightened slightly.
"Your only task from now on is to search this mansion thoroughly with me and find anything suspicious."
"..."
"Now, let's search! Opportunities like this don't come every day!"
After a quick pep talk, we began our search of the mansion.
Clang!
We smashed a statue that might have been hiding a Noark with a hammer.
Creak.
We brutally ripped off a frame, just in case a Noark was hiding behind it.
"Hmm, nothing here either."
"Sir, are you sure this is alright?"
"This isn't 'alright', it's how we do it.  This is how searches are conducted."
The royal search team, being lectured on searches by a barbarian, turned pale, but seeing me take the lead…
"Ah, I don't know!"
"Tear it apart! It's a noble mansion; there has to be a secret passage somewhere!"
Like chicks learning from their mother bird, the search team followed my lead, throwing aside any thoughts of the consequences.
Crack-
Clang.
Creak, creak, creak.
The Duke's mansion was quickly turning into chaos.
The head butler, who had greeted me so warmly before, watched the search in a daze, as if struck by lightning.
His reactions were quite entertaining.
"Ugh! How much did that cost…!"
He flinched, as if his own money was vanishing, then…
"No! Nothing! There's nothing behind that frame, so stop ripping it off!"
"It's even more suspicious now.  Hurry, rip it off…  Nothing, huh?"
"AAAAAAAHHHHH!!!"
He'd yell in anger, then…
"I'm done… I'm done…"
He would drop his head and mutter to himself, as if sensing his own future...
"Faster, faster! We don't have time to look at everything in detail, so hurry!"
It was a race against time.  The Duke had to have learned about our actions by now.
Thus…
First floor, second floor, third floor…
We swiftly and efficiently ravaged Terselion's mansion.
But perhaps it was because this was the mansion the Duke grew up in, the mansion where his grandfather grew up, a precious home...
"This is…"
It was incredibly stress relieving.
"BEHELLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!"
We enthusiastically smashed things, and when no one was watching, our hands moved faster than our eyes, stuffing expensive-looking objects into our pockets.
How long had we been searching?
"Finally found it."
We reached a room that seemed to be the Duke's study.  We ripped off a bookshelf attached to the wall, revealing a hidden steel door.
"Of course, there had to be a hidden room."
"What are you going to do? It looks pretty sturdy."
"What am I going to do?"
Like this situation wasn't new to me…
"The character is equipped with No. 687 Siege Slayer."
I swiftly switched weapons.
KWAAAAAAAAAAANG-!
I swung the mace towards the steel door, and swung again.
But the door was incredibly thick.  Each swing only made a dent; it didn't show any signs of breaking.
"This is going to take a while…"
What should I do?
As I pondered, one of our search team members stepped forward.
"May I try?"
Ah, right.  We had a few knights among us.
"Go ahead."
I stepped aside, and the knights began to cut the door with their aura.
Whatever metal it was, it resisted the aura, but they managed to slowly carve through it. Eventually, they severed the lock, and the door swung open.
"The Chancellor's secret room…"
What would be hidden down those stairs?
Intrigued, I was about to descend, but…
"Baron, I'm not going in."
"Neither am I."
Our brave soldiers, who had diligently searched the mansion, backed out at the last moment.
The reason was simple.
"We value our lives, too."
"Knowing when to not see what you shouldn't see is how you survive."
Tsk.  It was understandable, though.  For them, this was a life or death situation.  Because we were about to pry into the Duke's secrets.
"Alright. I'll go alone."
"Sir?  Alone?"
Raven seemed inclined to follow, but I shook my head.
Thinking about it again, it seemed safer to quickly check this place alone.
Therefore…
"I'll be right back. Just stop anyone who tries to enter."
With that, I descended alone into the hidden staircase behind the steel door.
The stairs weren't as deep as I expected, and a space large enough for someone to live in appeared soon.  I couldn't find a light switch, so I took out a candle from my bag.
Then…
Whoosh-!
The moment I activated my barbarian candle mode, the stone chamber was bathed in bright light.  I scanned the room, then froze.
Bookshelves lining both walls.  A small desk and chair for working.  At a glance, it looked like an ordinary secret study, but…
"Whoa, damn it…"
I swore out loud.  Even if this room held secret plans to kill me, this was something else.
Because the bookshelves, the desk, the walls, even the ceiling that I had to crane my neck to see…
"..."
They were covered with portraits of a woman.
It was like a stalker's room.
