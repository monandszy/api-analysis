## The Strategic Marriage (5)
Albreniv Kalstain, the leader of the Red Feline tribe.  It was comical, him even making such a statement. He and Misha weren't exactly father and daughter, and he'd always disliked me intensely.
"But to interfere at this juncture...," I thought. Could it be that I'd become strategically valuable now? The possibility was high, yet I still couldn't meet the gaze of the clan leader. Not just him, but the Dragon Lady and the Fairy representative as well. 
"Speak," the clan leader demanded.
"Is the clan leader's statement true?"
"Do you think I would lie?"
It felt like I was surrounded by three fathers-in-law. The Dragon Lady was relatively better, considering her lack of affection for her daughters. 
But the clan leader and the Fairy representative. Why did those two make me so uncomfortable? I'd rather sit on a bed of thorns. Physically or mentally.
"Perhaps I shouldn't have come?"
Just as I began to regret my participation in this interspecies council, a beacon of salvation emerged from an unexpected source.
"Shouldn't we all show some restraint?"
The Dwarf leader spoke, his voice laced with both firmness and discontent.
"I understand the feelings of a father who has a daughter. You'd think this was a matchmaking session."
"..."
"Besides, we all know this is strategically wrong. The five races, excluding the Humans, have avoided deep interaction, maintaining a balance. If someone starts crossing the line, that line loses all meaning."
The Dwarf leader's words were sound both in logic and justification. However...
"Hmph, I believe that line has long lost its meaning."
The Dragon Lady, clearly disagreeing, immediately launched into a counterargument.
"This fellow is already a representative of a tribe and holds a title in the Royal family. Have we ever seen such a case before?"
"Wasn't that issue… settled by the Royal family, saying they wouldn't interfere?"
From what I could tell, the Dwarf leader had apparently voiced complaints to the Royal family about my acquiring the title of tribal leader. 
"Well, it's understandable, given he's from the Dwarves. Their minds are naturally narrow...," I thought, feeling a bit indignant.  The urge to take the useless chair he was sitting on arose within me, a natural response. 
"That's why maintaining the line has no meaning anymore. The Royal family's intervention itself breaks the balance."
I quelled the urge and focused on the conversation. It sounded important, after all. 
"The Royal family seems to be leaning toward the idea of the five races harmonizing... What are your thoughts, Baron?"
The Dragon Lady's initial jab at the Dwarf leader now turned toward the Human representative, Baron Maxiland. It felt like the question had been building up to this.
"Haha, how could I know what the Royal family thinks...?," he replied, wriggling out of the question with a hollow laugh. 
It was astounding, him being the Human representative, yet still managing to be so shameless with his words. 
"Then, I was wrong?"
"I'd appreciate it if you considered me absent from this discussion. Is that too much to ask?"
He finally spoke firmly on this point, revealing that Baron Maxiland wasn't someone to underestimate. 
"He's here for a reason, of course."
When the Dragon Lady remained silent, the Baron, who had briefly turned serious, began to laugh again, his face now looking foolish.
"Haha, embarrassing, but this is my first time in such a gathering. Today, I'm here to learn. Excessive attention is too much for me."
"Learn, huh... That's enough. We understand how the Royal family views us."
"..."
The Baron remained silent, as if suggesting that he should figure it out himself. And with that, the topic was concluded. 
We returned to the original discussion.
"Ahem, my opinion remains unchanged. A tribal leader marrying someone from another race is unacceptable."
The Dwarf leader, glancing at the Baron who was quietly smiling in the corner, continued.
"Balance must be maintained. It's the only way for us interspecies races to demonstrate loyalty to the Royal family."
The Dwarf leader seemed to be trying to appeal to the Royal family in this situation. "We Dwarves aren't some harmless race." 
"This old man is so timid. Is it because he isn't an explorer?" I thought. The Dwarf leader was unlike any Dwarf I knew, but as someone who'd experienced the weight of responsibility, I understood his actions. 
Not that I intended to simply laugh and let it go. 
"So, you're saying I should marry someone from my own tribe?"
"That's the ideal scenario, but not necessarily the only option. If it's a human woman, be it a Werewolf or Fairy, there'd be no strategic concerns."
In other words, Erwin and Misha are out. 
"Strategic concerns...," I said, chuckling. I was listening, but it was getting harder to remain silent. 
"Dumoca, something came to mind. Is it alright to ask?"
"Go ahead."
Looking at the Dwarf leader, who responded like a forgiving senior, I asked straight up. 
"Why do you keep telling me what to do?"
"..."
"Are you my superior?"
I tilted my head slightly to match his eye level, just for good measure. Naturally, being a Dwarf, he was much shorter.
"...I apologize if I offended you. It was simply advice."
"Oh, then I have advice for you as well."
I saw the Dwarf leader looking at me with a confused expression and said firmly, "I'm the tribal leader of the Barbarians, a Baron of the Kingdom of Raphdonia. I'm also the master of the Anabada Clan."
He probably already knew all this, but...
"Above all, I am a warrior."
I didn't think he truly understood, so I continued, glaring down at him like a threat.
"So, from now on, never—"
"..."
"Give me orders."
Ah, but ending it like that would be a little too forceful to be called advice. Suddenly, I felt the need to add a final sentence, concluding my words of wisdom.
"Unless you want to duel with me."
Well, this is advice enough.
"..."
That Dwarf leader, who had never stepped foot in a maze, wouldn't say a word.
"..."
Be it Clan leader Kalstain, who once made me cower with a single glare.
Be it the Dragon Lady, the leader of the Dragonkin, a race known for their power.
Be it the Fairy who is said to be loved by all spirits.
Anyone.
"Do you all understand?"
I won't lose now. 
***
Thinking about it, actually. No, I don't even need to think. 
I stared directly at the Dwarf leader, whose face seemed to be frozen in shock from my strong words. "Isn't it funny, saying we need to maintain balance now?"
After all, Barbarians were the weakest race for so long.  A truly abysmal survival rate. We always lacked talent, and funds were always tight. We also lacked a natural talent for politics and business, which also contributed significantly to our weakness.
"I was the first Barbarian to become a nobleman in the long history of Raphdonia."
It wasn't like I was discriminating against Barbarians. It was something I always grumbled about in jest, but it wasn't made up out of thin air. 
The days when we had nothing. When I, Bjorn Yandell's son, lived as a weakling.
"I have experienced countless instances of contempt, ridicule, and discrimination against Barbarians in this city."
"Inside the city, our warriors couldn't hold normal jobs. And in the Maze, we had to fight looters who targeted our hearts."
"Back then, we couldn't even provide proper shoes for our young warriors. All we could offer was a weapon and a seven-day supply of rock bread."
And the important part was...
"What were you guys like then? Did you think about maintaining balance then?"
"That's—"
"Probably not."
I cut off the Dwarf leader, who was about to offer an excuse. I didn't need to hear it.
"If you had, you wouldn't have ignored the plea the former tribal leader made in this council."
There were misunderstandings back then, but the former tribal leader wasn't someone who just stood by while the Barbarians fell. He lacked the finesse, but he tried. Bringing up the issue of banning the research of the Tower's cores in this council was one of his efforts, trying to help our warriors.
"...Was that it? Did that day make you resent us?"
The Dwarf leader, as if finally understanding me, spoke with a gentle tone like he was comforting a child. "We couldn't do anything that day. We had to avoid conflict between the Tower and the Barbarians. It was for your tribe's sake—"
What is he rambling about?
I wasn't talking about that.
"You seem to have misunderstood something."
I interrupted him, clarifying once again. "I know."
I'm not a naive Barbarian, after all. After becoming tribal leader, I reviewed records, studied history, and dug up the hidden details. 
"I know that you Dwarves secretly supported the Fairies during the Sacred Artifact War, even though you were supposed to stay neutral."
"I know that you Dwarves met secretly with the Tower's mages right before the interspecies council."
"I even know that the rumour that Barbarians couldn't hold normal jobs in the city originated from the other races."
I know it all.
But...
"I don't harbor any resentment."
I meant it sincerely. I don't hate you for not helping us when we were struggling, or for stabbing us in the back. 
"I just hate it."
"..."
"This hypocritical attitude of talking about balance now."
So, basically...
"Please, don't ever say that again in front of me. All that nonsense about harmony and balance."
After my request, a heavy silence descended. And I found the silence anything but uncomfortable. Was it because I finally got to express the thoughts I'd held for so long to the representatives of each race? 
This silence even felt refreshing.
But...
"Hmph...,"
Unfortunately, the moment didn't last long.
"Bjorn Yandell, I understand what you mean."
The Fairy representative nodded. "I also have no intention of forcing you into marriage with anyone. I will support you, no matter what you choose."
The Dragon Lady followed with her agreement.
"But then...,"
Clan leader Kalstain, taking the lead, asked, "Who are you going to marry, then?"
Ugh, I'm going to puke.
