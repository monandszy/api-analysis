## Chapter 364: Responsibility (2)
Rihën Schwitz. 
Thinking about it, living under that name wasn't bad. 
With my current stats, even with my power concealed, I could accumulate enough wealth to retire in a few years. 
Of course, that meant giving up on returning…
'But who cares.' 
I had already adapted. 
This world, once a source of dread, was no longer so terrible. Lately, I even found myself thinking it was better than my old life. 
Here, I had people I could trust. 
People who believed in me. 
Relationships that never existed in the life of Lee Han-Soo. 
But…
'There's no guarantee I can hide my true identity forever.' 
How long could this new identity of Rihën Schwitz last? 
Well, no matter how careful I was, it wouldn't last forever. 
One never knew what the future held…
'There are already too many witnesses.' 
Eventually, the truth about Rihën Schwitz would leak out. 
Even if Raven submitted a false report, the jester was there. 
He would brag about meeting a fascinating fellow at the roundtable. 
The roundtable included the Stag's Horn, making it inevitable that the royal family would hear about it. 
'And I also showed them how to use the Essence of the gachapon.' 
It was a rare essence, but eventually, through research, they would uncover its properties, including its effect on bone density. 
That would lead them to realize my true height was much greater. 
Well, there was another crucial reason. 
'Auril Gaviss.' 
I still didn't know what that old geezer had done to me by giving me that hollow 'gift.' 
Simply put, hiding my identity and living in the shadows didn't guarantee safety. 
And so, the conclusion was the same. 
Just as when the fortune teller told me about my destiny under the guise of fortune telling. 
'I need to become stronger.' 
Strong enough to weather whatever storm may come. 
***
Hooong-!
While the officers were discussing their future plans in the operations room, the crystal ball on the desk vibrated. 
"This is the military message stone, directly connected to the command. Looks like we'll have to resume our conversation later when we have time." 
After all, it was impossible to focus solely on us during wartime. 
Honestly, even I began to wonder if this was sustainable. 
"We'll go out." 
"No, there's no need. We're nominally your guards, aren't we? Just try to be quiet when they call."
"If you say so."
Raven, after receiving the call from command, responded with a professional demeanor. Soon after, she summoned the officers within the unit. 
And…
"Deputy Commander, but those…." 
"Don't worry about them. They're my escorts."
"I, but we're in a meeting…"
"Do I need to repeat myself?"
"…"
Wow, this girl is really cut out for being a commander. 
She's so small, yet her voice exudes an aura of cold. 
"Okay, let's begin the meeting. Command just sent an order. They said they can't detect any enemy bio-signatures within the barrier."
Anyway, we were able to keep an eye on the situation while standing next to Raven. 
The enemy troops who had encircled the lake disappeared instantly. This happened two hours after they retreated to their warships and withdrew their entire force. 
"It could be a trap. They might be trying to lure us off the ships."
"I don't know. I think it's more likely that they truly retreated."
"Quiet down, everyone. Speculation is meaningless anyway. Command has decided to dispatch troops from each unit to search the area."
Raven, as if she had already planned who to send, selected members without hesitation and assigned them to the search team. 
How long had it been? 
Information was updated in real time through the troops dispatched on the search. 
[There's nothing to be seen around the lake.]
First, the lakeside, previously overflowing with the jester's undead, was completely empty. 
And also…
[The second search team reported finding traces of a large-scale magic spell.]
Traces of magic were found. 
Upon closer inspection, it was a multi-instantaneous teleportation magic circle. 
[The Golden Wall] being activated prevents anyone from using teleportation magic to enter from the outside, but not the other way around. 
Command also concluded that the enemy had withdrawn. 
But…
"We've received a standby order. It might be a bit uncomfortable, but we'll remain on the ships until the Golden Wall collapses and the main force returns. We'll also maintain our current alert status."
"Yes, I'll relay that to the explorers!"
Following the command's decision, the entire force remained on the warships, not venturing out to the lakeside. 
Time passed further…
Shooosh!
The Golden Wall, reaching the end of its activation period, crumbled into particles of magic, and the main force, which had gone on an expedition, rejoined the unit. 
Only then did we also go ashore to the lake and began to clear the battlefield. The main force waited for about a day, confirming the area was safe, and then left again for their expedition, leaving behind a small force in case anything happened. 
"The main force's objective is to find the Noirarc base, right?"
"Yes. Specifically, the entrance. It's most likely connected to a certain area, like the center of the crystal cave. If we can find and secure that place, we can research how this was all possible."
Wow, the main force must be super busy. 
They're searching on the 7th floor with a massive army. 
While I was having those thoughts, Raven let out a long sigh. 
"…Still, I'm glad it ended without any major incidents."
It wasn't completely incident-free…
But hey, no one died or anything. 
The aftermath of this incident is over, and I'm definitely getting that feeling too. 
But…
"Please, let there be no more incidents until we return."
Hey, there's a saying about words becoming reality. 
Raven's mutterings made me feel uneasy, but I couldn't believe something else would happen. 
We have a sizable force now—
"…Patrol squad?"
That's when I noticed a line on one of the documents on the desk. 
"Ah, that? They were a bit noisy about this from higher up due to the recent incident. Even though they were a small group, we didn't notice them until they infiltrated."
"So that's why they decided to deploy a patrol force?"
"Yes." 
Raven, busy with paperwork, answered concisely and returned to her work. 
Wow, doesn't she get bored being stuck here? 
I'm so restless, it feels like my mouth is dry. 
"Mister, are you bored?"
"A bit?"
"Then, shall we go for a walk together?"
"Then who's guarding Raven?"
"What, is that a problem? That woman will stay here, anyway."
Erwën's words made Amelia bristle. 
"…Who says so?"
"You're so sensitive. We'll come back, and then you can go rest." 
Wow, they'll start fighting again. 
"Both of you, stop it. I'm not interested in a walk." 
I mediated them, sat on a chair, and stared blankly at the wall. 
But the boredom grew. 
'Speaking of the patrol squad….'
It might be impulsive, but I felt much better going out than staying here. 
The patrol squad goes outside, doesn't it? 
We'll encounter monsters, which means I can naturally gain the experience points I haven't accumulated yet. 
'If I'm lucky, I might even reach level 7 this time.'
My decision was swift. 
"Raven, how do I join the patrol squad?"
"…You can't."
"Why not?"
"We've already selected all the members. Besides, it's against the rules to change assignments once you're given one. If we didn't, everyone would want to do the easy jobs. It's a matter of fairness."
Oh, that's right. 
I nodded and asked again. 
"Still, I feel like there's another way?"
"…It is possible to change assignments at the discretion of the commanding officer of the unit."
What? So you were just teasing me? 
That's mean. 
"But you're the commanding officer. You can just change it—"
"So I said you can't go. I won't let you."
"…Why?"
"I won't, okay? I'm not letting you go while I'm away. What if you cause some kind of accident there?"
Raven didn't even look my way as she coldly drew the line. 
Of course, it wasn't a big deal. 
I wouldn't give up just because of that. 
"Haha! That was the problem?" 
I chuckled, acting as if it was nothing. Raven tilted her head. 
"…"
What's with those eyes? 
That's why bookworms don't do well. 
Their brains are hardened, making them lack flexibility in thought. 
"You say there's a problem because I'm not there?"
"…"
"Then, why don't we go together!"
I offered a solution. Raven narrowed her eyes and looked me up and down. 
And…
"Just curious, but does your world have barbarians or any similar species?"
Ah, uh, hmm…
"…"
I was asked an unexpected question. 
***
As a result, I joined the patrol squad. 
Raven is a rationalist, after all. 
"Let me go!"
"…"
"Let me go! I promise I won't cause any accidents!"
"…"
"Let me go!"
The Barbarian Parrot mode, the mode that worked so well back in the crystal cave. 
I activated that mode, and Raven, initially ignoring me, couldn't help but respond. 
"No, you're so stubborn in the worst places!" 
"Then let me go!"
"…I said no! And you didn't answer for over an hour!! You need to know when to stop and listen!"
"I don't understand, so let me go!!"
"Sigh…"
If your opponent stops their anger and sighs, it's a sign of resignation. 
I continued to push that opening and finally, Raven gave her permission. 
She decided that it was better to deal with my interference for a while than to have me stay here. 
Oh, it wasn't just because she had to give in to my stubbornness. 
"Ugh, really! Why are you pushing so hard!! You could just stay here and behave for a few days!!"
"…Because there are monsters out there."
"…"
"Didn't I say it? I need to become stronger."
"Ugh… You say that, but what am I supposed to do…."
So, the OK sign was given. 
Oh, of course, Raven didn't come with me, as I had initially suggested. 
I wanted to go together, but the command wouldn't allow it. 
"I'm the only one who can use the Golden Wall in this place. I need to stay here in case something happens."
Now that I think about it, she's a valuable asset. 
"Then, leave Emily or Erwën behind."
"If it's because of my escort, there's no need. I was fine without Yande… I mean, Schwitz here, even before."
Hmm, but I'm still worried…
"I'm fine, really. Just don't cause any trouble out there. Don't use [Giant Form] under any circumstances. Don't slack off on the patrol duty just because you're hunting monsters. And also…."
She gave me instructions like a primary school student going on a field trip. Finally, after giving me a long list of warnings, Raven contacted higher-ups and changed my unit. Only then was I able to leave the barracks. 
Luckily, a patrol squad was just about to leave. 
"Welcome, newcomers. It's an honor to meet you, Tersia."
Once we arrived at our destination, the patrol squad leader greeted us and checked our stats. 
"Bloodling Lady, your main skills are bow and spirit magic, so you'll be in the center formation…  The other two, are you both melee-based?"
"That's right."
I nodded. The squad leader then asked for a more detailed breakdown of our positions. Amelia, the agile damage dealer, was placed on the left wing of the formation. 
And me…
"Seeing your heavy armor and shield, you must be a tank—"
No, this small body of mine can't take a hit. 
I cut him off before he could label me a tank. 
"I'm the one who smashes things."
"…Huh? Then what's that shield?"
"It's for show."
I put the shield in my subspace and gripped the Crowl's Devil Crusher with both hands. 
"I'll be on the right wing."
I won't be able to rampage while using [Giant Form], anyway. 
It's okay to be a melee-based character for a change.
