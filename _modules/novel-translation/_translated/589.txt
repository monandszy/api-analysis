## 589화 Boss Run (2)
Amelia Rainwells.
A top-tier talent, she could wield aura and possessed the "Guide" aptitude. 
Her class was…
"Probably something like a Shadow Rogue."
At any rate, her current level was 8, and she had one empty Essence slot. She had deliberately cleared out one just before descending to the 1st Underground Level.
[Affinity]
Essence of Kapravara, a 5-tier monster with a passive skill that prevented monsters from attacking first.
It might have been useful when she was alone, but now, traveling with us, it had become an unnecessary Essence.
Well, there was another Essence with a similar effect.
"Emily, when we return to the city, clear out Esgen's Essence too."
"Esgen's Essence…?"
"What's with that surprised expression?  As I mentioned before, your days of traveling alone are over."
"……………I'll think about it."
Think about it?
With [Unquenchable Flame], even if we brought a priest, they wouldn't be able to heal properly.
‘Why is she so reluctant to clear it out?’
If we had companions, Esgen's Essence could be easily replaced with potions or other items.
Why is she so attached to this Essence?
‘…Does she not fully trust us yet?’
Well, it was possible.
She must have relied on that skill countless times in the past to overcome near-death experiences when she was on her own.
She'll need more time to adjust.
"……Alright, think about it. It's not like we have a priest in our clan yet."
I ended the conversation by deciding to persuade her about this issue later.
Just as I was about to move on to the topic of the boss…
"It… seems to have been resolved, hasn't it?"
Amelia abruptly interjected.
Seeing my questioning gaze, Amelia cleared her throat and continued in a low voice.
"I'm talking about Misha Kalstain."
Ah, that's what she was referring to.
She hadn't received a proper explanation after that, so it made sense that she was curious about the inner workings of the situation.
"Thanks to you, it was resolved well.  I also confirmed that there were no more secrets to hide—"
"…Confession."
"…What?"
"That… I heard you received it. From Kalstain."
Oh…….
I could only feel genuine surprise.
"Seeing your expression, it seems that what I heard is true."
"True or not, how in the world do you know about that?"
"I heard it from Tersia."
"From Erwen…?"
"She said she went looking for you that day and overheard you talking in your room."
"Ah…."
I just stared blankly, and Amelia cautiously asked,
"So… what did you say?"
Was it right to talk about what happened that day without Misha's permission? While pondering this question, I decided to honestly tell her about that day's events.
Amelia had helped me with this matter, after all.
"We are… just friends…."
"Right, that's how things ended, somewhat neatly. So you don't need to worry—."
"It'll be a mud-slinging battle."
"…What?"
"No, it's just mumbling."
Despite the incredibly meaningful statement, I couldn't get a response when I asked what she meant.
Amelia brought up a new topic as if trying to avoid the conversation.
"Yandel, just in case, I'm asking this."
Her serious tone made me anxious about what she was about to say—.
"Do you, by any chance, like men?"
"…What?"
"Don't worry. I don't have any prejudice against that sort of thing. I've met many people who shared that preference in Noir—."
What is she even saying?
"Mind your words, Amelia Rainwells."
I barely managed to speak, suppressing the bubbling rage in my lower abdomen.
"I like women. And I like them very much."
"……R, right? Oh… well… I, I didn't know you liked them that much—"
"So don't ever say that in front of me again. It was far more humiliating than when you called me 'Hans' by mistake."
"…I'm sorry. I'll be careful. It won't happen again. I promise. I swear on my sister."
Amelia's prompt and sincere apology calmed me, and I sighed, suppressing my anger.
"Huh…."
This is strange.
It's not like I hate homosexuals or anything, so why am I so angry?
I don't know why, but Amelia continued what she was saying, even though she was watching my reaction carefully.
"Anyway… that's good."
"Good, how so?"
"You're a noble now, aren't you?  In this world."
"What?"
I tilted my head in confusion, and Amelia avoided my gaze for some reason.
"W, well… I don't know what your original world was like… but… it's okay here."
"……"
"Even if you like women very much."
How did the conversation get here?
I have absolutely no idea, but I let out a roar from the bottom of my abdomen.
Even if she was a valuable comrade, there was no choice.
When I needed to scold her, I had to scold her.
The spirit of Hongik Ingan and Confucianism.
The one who inherited both.
And, a true-blooded Korean who was born inheriting the lineage of the Joseon Dynasty's Yi clan.
The one who knows only Korea, Korea, and Korea.
A KKK-Barbarian, so to speak.
"Gal—!!!!"
This is simply unacceptable.
***
"Gal…?"
Amelia had never heard the Confucian yell before.
As one who had a duty to benefit the world, I quickly explained the meaning of that yell.
"It's a common expression used in our world when scolding someone."
"……Does that mean I said something that deserves scolding?"
Humph, does she still not understand the logic?
Even if she deserved a three-day scolding, I calmly opened my mouth, because she was a comrade.
"Of course. In our royal family, we don't have such promiscuous culture."
Amelia was taken aback by my words.
"Our royal family…?"
"I didn't tell you because I was afraid it would burden you, but my surname 'Yi' signifies that I'm a descendant of the Joseon Dynasty."
"You're saying… you're royalty?"
"………………Yes, but a branch lineage."
My conscience was pricking, but it wasn't a lie, was it?
There's room for interpretation according to the records.
Due to the nature of a single ethnic group, there's a high possibility that our blood is slightly mixed.
"……Royalty. That's surprising."
Surprisingly, Amelia readily accepted it.
However, she seemed to have one question.
"But didn't you say the country you lived in was Korea?"
"Joseon is… an ancient kingdom that has already perished."
"I see… so you're saying you were a descendant of a perished ancient kingdom."
Oh…….
"Yes."
There is room for that interpretation as well.
It's a bit more prestigious than just being a commoner named Yi A.
"Now I understand. Why you were so obsessed with survival… You must have been in a situation where you had no choice but to do that since you were young. You must have had a sense of duty as well."
"……"
I took the stance of remaining silent.
However, perhaps revealing my identity sparked her curiosity?
Amelia began asking me various questions.
"Joseon was a truly peculiar country. Even the royalty could not have multiple wives."
I had no answer for this one either.
Technically, Joseon practiced polygamy.
In fact, they had concubines, not just wives.
…And a lot of them.
‘Perhaps… polygamy is a fundamentally sound social institution?’
That thought crossed my mind, but I shook my head.
No, it can't be.
The current Yi dynasty, the K-government, who inherited Confucianism, practices monogamy, doesn't it?
‘…But this is a different world, isn't it?’
Thinking about it, even murder is considered a grave offense in Korea, under the rule of the K-government.
And right now, I'm a mass murderer who has killed hundreds of people.
‘But is there a reason to get so hung up on it?’
The demon dwelling in my left arm suddenly whispered, but I covered my ears and eyes.
I didn't need to make excuses about Confucianism or social institutions. It's just that I grew up in that world, so my body instinctively rejects these kinds of stories.
Did she notice that?
"…It seems it was a sensitive topic for you. I'm sorry."
Amelia apologized again, and I accepted her apology because I felt like I had reacted too harshly.
Of course, accepting her apology didn't mean I understood.
"It's fine. But why did you bring it up so suddenly?"
When I asked her the reason, Amelia said it was simply because I seemed to need advice. Then she mumbled in a small voice,
"I didn't think it wouldn't be a mud-slinging battle."
A voice that seemed to hold a sense of doom.
"In the end… there'll be bloodshed."
"……What are you talking about again?"
"Ah, it's just mumbling. Don't mind it."
No, even if you say that, I do mind!
***
What is more befitting of the KKK spirit?
After my conversation with Amelia, which made me ponder that question, we finally got down to discussing the boss strategy.
And…….
"Are you sure we just have to jump down?"
Finally, we arrived at the boss room…
Or rather, the entrance to the boss room.
Whoosh—!
A cliff that exuded a chilling coldness.
All that could be seen below was an abyss of darkness.
"Don't worry. There was no fall damage."
"Fall… damage…?"
"It means there's no falling damage."
Despite my explanation, Amelia still couldn't quite understand.
She seemed to have a slight aversion to falling as well.
So, I just carried Amelia on my back and jumped down.
"……!"
Normal people would scream, but Amelia was different. She might pull my hair and resist, but she wouldn't even moan.
Boom-!
The thud of impact as we arrived at the bottom of the cliff.
After a brief moment, Amelia regained her composure and stepped off my shoulder.
Then, she glared at me and sighed.
"You could be so delicate sometimes, but why do you always…."
"What did you say?"
"……"
"Forget it, Barbarian. So where's the enemy?"
She called me Barbarian instead of Yandel, so I think she's a bit miffed, but I'll deal with that later.
"It'll come out soon."
As I raised my shield in warning, the entire space vibrated.
And then, it appeared.
Boom-!
Its size surpassed even that of most Ogres.
Three horns jutted out from its forehead, and it had a single, cyclopean eye.
Its chest area was torn apart as if rotted, revealing its ribs…
Slurp.
A grotesque tongue, sticking out from the gap, darted out.
As if eyeing its prey.
Oh, of course, those details didn't bother me at all.
‘…This one doesn't talk either.’
It had always run away throughout the progression of the rift, but now, after finally being lured, it was swaggering.
"Get ready, Amelia."
"You, are you calling me by my—"
"We are only two here, aren't we?"
"Yandel, mistakes always happen."
Oh, she's really laying into me.
It's not like I can't call her by her name after all this time.
"This is all because of you—"
"Behel—raaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!"
Before she could nag any longer, I activated [Gigantification] and charged forward.
As I held it in place by bumping into it, Amelia stopped talking and started doing her thing.
"Amelia Rainwells has activated [Self-Replication]."
As expected of a Shadow Rogue, she summoned her clones first, filling in for the lack of manpower as if trying to compensate all by herself. She attacked it from both flanks.
Smoothly and naturally, like twin swordsmen who had honed their art for years.
"Amelia Rainwells has activated [Suragak]."
She landed a kick on the beast's head, which was several times larger.
"Amelia Rainwells has activated [Abyssal Strength]."
She even used aura to slice through its tough skin.
I felt the difference compared to when I came with Raven, a mage.
While a mage takes a long time to unleash a powerful blow, Amelia, as a melee class, unleashes high DPS continuously.
And…….
‘It’s definitely got a high value, so its damage expectancy is high.’
Even when calculated in terms of time, Amelia deals significantly more damage than Raven.
Well, that's assuming she can deal full damage during that time.
‘The biggest problem is resources….’
Amelia’s instantaneous firepower is second only to Erwen.
However, the duration of that firepower is drastically short. Due to her Essence combination, her MP is bound to run out quickly…
‘That drawback stands out more now that she has to deal damage solo.’
[Self-Replication]'s MP consumption is among the highest.
This is because the consumption value for a clone using a skill increases fivefold.
Up until now, she'd been surviving by relying on her increased MP thanks to [Abyssal Strength]…
‘This is something I should have solved a long time ago.’
The fact that this flaw hasn't surfaced yet is entirely thanks to Amelia's physical abilities.
Look at this.
"Amelia Rainwells has activated [Switch]."
She only uses the clones to draw attention and attacks mainly with her actual body.
Even then, she carefully targets the vital points and maintains her own pace, ensuring her MP never falls below a certain threshold.
That’s why she only uses aura sparingly, only when necessary.
Just like this.
Slicing-!
Amelia's aura severed the beast's neck at the end of the long battle.
I was ready to intervene actively if she looked too tired.
‘To showcase this kind of performance with this half-baked character….’
I couldn't help but smirk.
"Helljaw Herja has been defeated. EXP +6"
"Guardian Defeat Bonus. EXP +3"
It's always a happy occasion when a comrade grows stronger.
