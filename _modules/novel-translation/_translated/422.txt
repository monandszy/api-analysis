## Chapter 422: Ice-Cold (Part 2)
I had abandoned all hope of being rescued. I had abandoned the food, abandoned the equipment. Even after running, I was forced to helplessly watch my comrades die, overtaken by the enemy.  Survival is always about that, isn't it? Giving up, and giving up again. Deceiving yourself by choosing the most rational option in an irrational situation.
That's why I burned everything I had, using it as fuel to move forward. But...
"An enemy! New enemies have appeared!"
What else must I abandon now?  Damnit, I already know the answer.
"Jun, I'll leave this place to you for now."
I hastily handed off the task and headed back.  As soon as I turned, I saw a group of ranged attackers charging towards us from behind. The enemy was close behind.
"Master...!"
"Erwen!"
"There are about a dozen of them! They don't look like knights, but they use Aura! Right now, Gerod is holding them off alone!"
Bentis Gerod. An ability user belonging to the third team.  He was a cheerful man with a smiling face, always positive in a way that got him a lot of teasing, but he was well-liked by everyone. 
"Thank you for letting me know. Follow Akuraba and join the main force."
"...Be careful!"
By the time Erwen and I reached the rear, he was lying on the ground, a pool of blood staining the cold earth.  The blood steamed as it touched the frigid air.
"So... another one dead."
If it hadn't been for him, more would have been injured and killed.
My heart constricted, but this harsh reality didn't allow for mourning. 
I lifted my head and looked directly at the enemy.  A dozen or so enemies were standing over Gerod's corpse.  Seeing them, I recalled a conversation I had with the leader of the Orcullis in Noark.
[Human female.]
[Red Aura, shaped like a needle, specialized in daggers.]
[All hallmarks of the Rose Knights.]
Rose Knights.  The royal family's direct special forces, responsible for tasks such as assassination, infiltration, and espionage.
So, this is where we finally meet.
The woman with the dagger, dripping with blood, stood motionless, her gaze locked on me.  It was similar to Amelia the first time we met.  An emotionless gaze. And...
"Viscount Bjorn Jandel."
A voice as barren as a desert.
"According to information, you possess at least a level 2 or higher sword defense ability. Your estimated combat power is two levels higher than each of us, so proceed with caution."
The moment her business-like briefing ended, they all assumed an attack stance. 
I hadn't felt this way in a long time, but I genuinely shivered.  I'm not afraid of someone who doesn't even know me shouting that they're going to kill me. But these are different.
Professionals trained solely for the purpose of murder.
My warrior's heart thumped, anticipating a difficult battle, even though we hadn't clashed weapons yet.
But...
What am I supposed to do? 
"Did the Duke send you?"
I asked, ready to respond immediately, but no answer came.
"..."
Their eyes were fierce.  Are they refusing to talk to someone they intend to kill?
Their professional demeanor extinguished even the slight hope I had.  But there's at least one thing I want to know.
"How did you know to be waiting here?"
"..."
"What? Tell me. I can't figure this one out no matter how much I think. Do you not feel sorry for us?"
Despite my sarcastic tone, the woman didn't change her expression and simply stared at me before quietly speaking.
"..."Someone insisted, so they were on standby just in case. Even the Intelligence Department considered it unlikely that you'd actually reach this place."
"Unlikely..."
I couldn't help but chuckle.
After all, how likely is it that we'd complete the mission after such a difficult journey, be abandoned by our allies in the heart of the enemy's territory, and yet still find a way to reach this place using our own strength? 
Especially a makeshift expeditionary force formed just a few days ago.
It's an understatement to say it's unlikely.
"..."Why are you laughing?"
"I just feel like you guys can't handle us."
After all, what kind of sense does it make to station this kind of force on standby just to cut off even that unlikely possibility?
It feels like I'm being squeezed in from all sides by a giant wall.  There's no escape, no matter which way I turn.
"I guess that means the conversation has failed."
The woman muttered, her gaze locked on me.
"Failed?"
"Someone who's lost their will wouldn't make that kind of expression."
What? So, you were answering me because you wanted me to be devastated?
I whined.
"That's strange. I was already feeling pretty despairing."
"So are you going to die here?"
"No. I'll fight as long as I can."
"Right, there are people like you. They never see death as a refuge."
My answer caused a flicker of change in the woman's expression.  A very subtle change, but it felt like a hint of pity.
Of course, I can't know for sure. Maybe I'm just seeing things.
But even if I am right, nothing will change.
"I guess it's time to end the conversation."
I stated.
"..."
She didn't answer. We both knew it was true. 
"Behellâ€”laaaaaaaa!!!"
There was no need for further conversation.
***
Aura-resistant Essence, Voll-Herchan. 
Thanks to this, I evolved into a being that knights feared, but that doesn't mean I'm invincible. This isn't [Dungeon & Stone] for a reason.
The daggers, while not slicing me like tofu, still inflict minor injuries that add up with each hit.  The priest's Divine Power has long since run out, so healing is out of the question.  In the midst of all this...
[Character has been poisoned by Royal Blend.]
[Character's Physique stat is over 700.]
[Poison resistance stat is over 100.]
[Poison effect reduced by 70%.]
Whatever they've coated these blades with, a stinging sensation radiates from the wounds.  They've even added a wound deterioration effect, as even natural regeneration is blocked.
The wounds continue to pile up.
Hooooooong-!
I swing my hammer like swatting away flies, but it just cuts through the air once again.  
They climb walls, perform somersaults in mid-air, and abruptly change direction with impossible deceleration.  They dodge every single one of my attacks, but even a slight opening is enough for them to slice me with daggers.
The wounds might be small individually, but...
Serr, serr-
My already relatively slow body becomes even clumsier, increasing the number of times I'm injured.  
If the terrain were wider and a dozen of them were attacking from all sides, I would have been torn to shreds and collapsed on the ground by now.
"...Ugh!"
My body lurches forward.  A dagger swings towards my neck.
"Now!"
I put all my strength into my leg and swing my hammer.
But...
"Damn it, get hit already!"
This isn't working either?  It's like I'm fighting against machines, not humans. 
I can't help but utter a sigh of frustration.
[Character has used [Soul Dive].]
[Soul Power regenerates in proportion to the amount consumed.]
I immediately use [Soul Dive], as it's finally off cooldown, to replenish my rapidly depleting MP.
At that exact moment.
"We're here to help!"
Reinforcements arrive.  It's Ravien and Amelia, who should have been holding the line against the Noark bastards.
"What about the front? What happened at the front?"
Amelia answers my question.
"They've retreated outside the Glacial Eye boundary, and they're in a stalemate so far."
Right, they're recovering.  Waiting for us to weaken while we're fighting them.  After all, even if they don't know the full picture, it's a wise decision, as they aren't sure if the Rose Knights are on their side.
"Damnit, why do I have to be caught in the middle?"
I raise my shield to protect my upper body.
Kung-!
The dagger deflects, as if hitting a solid wall.  
But there's no pain in my legs, even after a while.  Usually, they would have been attacking my legs with daggers by now.  
Why?
I look at the Rose Knights, who are maintaining a vague distance, and understand.
"Ah, it's thanks to these guys."
They're too busy guarding against Amelia and Ravien on my flanks to attack my legs.  Right, weaklings should be dealt with by weaklings.  
"Phew, at least I have some breathing room now."
I shout loud enough for Akuraba in the rear to hear.  After all, I'm a tank and the leader of the expeditionary force! I have to fulfill both roles.
"Akuraba, if you can, keep them in a stalemate with the Noark bastards!"
It pains me to give the Noark bastards time, as I was just about to finish them off, but there's no other way...
"Huh?"
What's this?  They're ignoring me.  Not just ignoring me, but they look like they're not even hearing anything I'm saying. 
"Amelia, is Sound Control magic active right now?"
"Ah, it seems the mages who came down here activated it."
"...Came down?"
What is this nonsense?
Ravien, blocking a dagger aimed at my shoulder, replies.
"As soon as the attack began, the priests and mages used Float magic to escape together."
"Escape? You mean... there are enemies above?"
"Yes. The Roita Mamen, the priest, was killed by a surprise attack."
"...I see..."
I'm getting nothing but bad news.  It's not enough that the dozen enemies weren't the full force, they've killed one of our priests too.
"We're down to 19... "
The expeditionary force, which started with 30, has already dwindled this much.  Even if we manage to return alive, we'll be less than half the original number. 
Kwak-
The pent-up rage boils inside me.  I have been giving up, and giving up again.  I haven't even abandoned the dreams of a golden future.  I've fought and bled for that future, a future that's nothing but rolling through a pigsty.
But why does this irrational situation continue endlessly?
I want to scream, curse, and blame God.  But...
"Aaaaaaaargh!!!"
I let out a burst of air, desperately trying to control the heat rising in my head. 
We don't need hot rage right now.  
At least, not me. Not at this moment.
"...Akuraba!"
"Yes, Master!"
"You don't need to help here.  All of you, recover as much as you can.  We'll have a big job soon."
There's only one chance. 
***
"It's a crazy plan."
"If we follow you, we'll all die."
No one said anything like that.  
"...Okay. I'll do what you said."
Akuraba immediately follows my orders, and so do the other members.  
Have I earned some recognition as a leader during this expedition?  If so, it's a little satisfying.  It's not like all my hard work has been in vain. 
"Behellâ€”laaaaaaaa!!!"
With the support from the rear cut off, the Rose Knights' attack intensifies.
"Jandel is facing over ten enemies alone! Do anything you can to stop him!"
To add insult to injury, the Noark bastards, who had finished their preparations, finally launch their full attack.  
And we do only one thing.
"Hold on!"
We hold on.  
The priest has run out of Divine Power, and the ranged support has stopped.  
We maintain a front on both sides, buying time.
"Aaargh!!!"
We're surrounded, and they're giving us a hard time, but it's surprisingly manageable.  
"They must think we're already dead."
The Noark and the Rose Knights are engaged in a silent game of chicken,  assuming we're already finished.  
"If we all die, they'll have to fight each other again, huh?"
Whatever my personal feelings, the enemy's complacency was a positive sign. 
Because it finally came. 
Drrrrdrrrdrrrdrrrd. 
The gorge shakes as if an earthquake has struck.
Sooaaaahhhh-
A frigid white mist rises from beneath the cliff, where there had only been darkness, like an abyss.
[Character has been exposed to [Frozen Belief].]
[Binding Magic is deactivated.]
The Glacial Mage, Kariadera.  The bastard, after struggling to crawl up from the bottom, finally arrived.
"Damnit! Break through!"
A panicked cry erupts from the Noark side.
"..."Do it as quickly as possible."
Their demeanor is more polite, but the Rose Knights are clearly just as surprised.
I can't help but chuckle.
"I guess I was the only one who calculated the time it would take for the boss to arrive."
Well, it explains why they were so relaxed.
[Grrrraaaaaaaaah]
Thousands of skeletons flail their arms in the mist, and the Elder Lich, Kariadera, stares at us with blood-red eyes from the center of the mist.
"Jandel, everything is ready!"
The "big one" I asked for from the ranged damage dealer line is ready just in time. 
So...
"Fire!"
There's nothing left to do but try.
[James Kala has used [Piercing Light].]
[Erwen Fornach di Tersia has used [Elemental Synthesis].]
[Titana Akuraba has used [No. 1911 Pavel's Broken Pocket Watch].]
[Versil Goulond has used the level 3 offensive magic "Annihilating Flame".]
[Mackely Riaders has used the level 3 offensive magic "Condemnation".]
[Liard Ashed has used the level 3 offensive magic "Magic Ray".......]
Not just the ranged damage dealers, everyone with a ranged skill joins in.  
They unleash their skills with all their might, as their cooldowns and MP allow.
It's not against the Noark, nor the Rose Knights. 
Kwakwakwakwakwang-!
It's against the Elder Lich, who just revealed himself.
[The Glacial Mage Kariadera's first Soul Vessel has been destroyed.]
Phew, our firepower was enough, huh?
[Kieeeeeeek!]
The banshees, summoned from the mist, wail in agony and glow.
And simultaneously...
Drdgrk, Drrdgrk, Dkdrd, Kkgrk.
The Elder Lich, having instantly restored his shattered bones, raises a hand towards us.
[The Glacial Mage Kariadera has used [Soul Extraction].]
[Soul Extraction].  The pattern he uses in phase 2.
I take a deep breath and close my eyes.
"Phew..."
There's nothing I can do.  The dice have been thrown in the midst of this raging storm. 
[All characters within the area are stunned.]
All I can do is pray for a good roll.
