## Chapter 658: Outsider (2)
Beyond the city walls, a place known for millennia as a wasteland where no living creature could survive due to a witch's curse.  I don't know much about it. The day the royal army descended into the underground to vanquish Noark, a mysterious mage appeared, rescuing the Noark forces and leading them to escape beyond the city walls. It was on that day, the 2nd of June in the 154th year of the Great Opening.  
Players who were among the Noark forces first shared the news in the community, and it quickly spread throughout the city.  There were two things that felt strange about it. 
Firstly, the news spread with an alarming speed as if it were intended to be known. Secondly, there was not a single piece of substantial information accompanying the news.  The circumstances raised a reasonable suspicion of organized information control.  
Even the loquacious jester rarely divulged any information about the area beyond the walls during the Round Table discussions.  The only noteworthy comment he made was this: 
"Having ventured outside the city and explored various areas, I’ve come to realize that, while there might be slight differences in terrain and structure, this land bears a striking resemblance to the seven-layered Dark Continent!"
According to the jester, this continent, where the Last Fortress, Laphdonia, resides, shares similar geographical features with the seven-layered Dark Continent. 
"If his words are true, that hypothesis might hold some truth."
"Are you referring to the hypothesis that the Labyrinth is not a portal to another dimension but rather a dimension created by someone?"
"The Crystal Cave, the Rock Desert... perhaps they were all modeled after real places."
The Round Table members voiced their opinions on the topic, their speculations partially correct.  After all, we had discovered it firsthand through our explorations. 
'Most of the locations within the Labyrinth are based on real places.'
Through countless adventures and explorations, we had gathered direct evidence, and I harbored no doubt about this premise.  
But…
'That’s what makes it even more unsettling.'
Ancient maps of the continent are all lost, leaving no available records.  Yet, there are remnants of these records.
"It’s one of the few families still clinging to the Middle Continent naming conventions."
"It’s understandable why you find it unfamiliar. Families like ours, whose bloodline is so strongly tied to the Eastern Continent, are few and far between in this city."
"It's a South-Middle Continent naming convention."
Some of the Laphdonia residents still hold onto their ancestral history and the identity of their family lineage. The Barbarians, for instance, are a prime example.  
Records state that the Barbarians were a tribe that survived by fighting beasts in the treacherous terrains of the northern and southern regions of the continent.  
The problem is…
'They said it took over two years to travel from the north to Laphdonia.'
This is the distance mentioned in the records.  
However, in the Dark Continent within the Labyrinth, it takes only a month or two to traverse from one end to the other. 
Where does this discrepancy arise?
'Well, this is nothing compared to what I’ve learned later.'
In the first basement floor, the vampire gentleman told me:
"In that era... were there only humans?"
In ancient times, no other races existed.  
And if that’s true, then all the history and records of this world are fabricated. 
What is the truth? 
What secrets are concealed in this world?
Up until now, I haven't been overly proactive in uncovering the truth, content with focusing on my own tasks.  
However, the situation has changed.  
Noark has aggressively invaded and occupied a section within the city walls. The royal family's response is also suspect.
'...I need to know.'
Only by possessing the same information as they do can I prepare for the future.  
It's like in a game, right? 
If you don't know something, you just get hit and suffer the consequences. 
"...Yandell?"
"Ah, sorry. I was lost in thought."
Having finished my ruminations, I returned to where the others were.
"Hahaha! Did you see that? My spear is stronger than an arrow!!"
"...I was holding back, fearing you might get hurt! Again! Let’s do it again!"
"Huh? Where were you, mister?"
Alright, let's take a break today. 
***
The next day, after the welcoming ceremony that continued late into the night, I set out for the sewers with three guides.  Amelia, Erwin, and Versil.
“Wow… It's been ages since I last visited the sewers.  But why are we here, mister?"
“I'm looking for something."
"Ah! So that’s why you called us!”
Amelia and Erwin were the most skilled searchers among the Anabada members, and Versil was our only mage.
"Can I… ask what you are looking for? I'd feel more at ease if I knew what we're looking for so that I could actively contribute."
Versil’s inquiry prompted me to reveal the purpose of my visit.
“We are here to locate the passage that connects to the outside world."
"The... outside world…?"
I nodded in confirmation, and Versil, who had been taken aback, regained his composure and asked cautiously:
“...Do you plan to venture outside the city walls?”
“Yes. I believe I need to experience it firsthand to determine what is true and what is not.”
"Ah…"
"Keep it a secret.  Just between us, understand?"
I didn't want to divulge the information to anyone who might blab about it, so I merely gave a brief warning before continuing our journey.  It's not like a hidden passage to the outside world is just sitting around in the sewers where vagrants reside.  We'll need to head further down the sewers, all the way to the underground fortress of the (former) Noark.
Thud.
Amelia, who was leading the way, stopped and signaled for us to be quiet.  Erwin nodded slightly, indicating he also sensed something. 
'Slowly.'
'Back up.'
'Over here.'
Following Amelia’s signals, I turned into a side path and concealed ourselves. Soon, even my dull ears could detect footsteps.  
Squelch, Squelch—
At least two individuals were patrolling the sewers, and the sound of their footsteps grew louder. 
'Vagrants?'
My first thought was of vagrants, but if they were, Amelia wouldn't have tried to hide us.
We waited, holding our breath, until they passed by our hiding place. 
'...Knights?'
Not just any knights.  
These were not affiliated with a specific family but rather full-plated knights bearing the royal insignia.
"Emily, what is it?  Why are those fellows roaming the sewers at this hour?"
"Didn't you know? Knights have been patrolling the sewers periodically since the incident a few months ago. Security has been heightened."
"I think I read about that in the newspaper. They say it has eliminated the vagrant population in the sewers…"
Well, maybe I haven't been reading the newspapers enough lately.  
Regardless, I was taken aback by the sudden appearance of the patrolling knights.  
You know what they say:  A guilty conscience needs no accuser. 
I thought they might have deployed them here knowing we would be coming.
"Let's keep moving. There are fewer patrol forces stationed in the sewers, and it doesn’t seem like they are searching very thoroughly, so we should be able to avoid detection unless we're incredibly unlucky."
"That's good to hear."
It was a redundant statement, but seeing the patrolling knights didn’t trigger any particular anxiety.  
I trust Amelia's infiltration skills, but it's also because things are different from the old days.  
Even if something goes wrong, I can turn those two knights into ex-knights in the blink of an eye.  
In essence, if we don't want anything bad to happen, it's not us who need to be careful, it’s them. 
"There's a device here, as usual.  Just wait a moment."
Upon reaching the path leading to the Noark fortress, Amelia knelt in front of the entrance and touched something with her hands.  
Then...
"You can enter now. I've deactivated it carefully, so no trace will be left."
Ah, so that was the device.  
In movies, they use something like that, right?  They place a small piece of paper in the doorway to check if anyone has entered.
Thump, thump. 
We descended the stairs, and unlike the sewers, the underground space we entered was an unfamiliar, dimly lit place.  The ceiling height and wall structures varied, creating an illusion of a three-dimensional maze. 
'Come to think of it, this is the place… where I fought that Karui priestess.'
Was her name… Elisha? It was so long ago, when I had just devoured the Orc hero’s essence, that I can’t recall clearly. 
Anyway…
She was a formidable opponent, but with my stats and the overall improvement of the Half-Punk team’s capabilities, we managed to take her down.
'None of the team members from that time are here.'
Should I have brought Misha?  We could have reminisced about those days.
'Ah, come to think of it, Amelia was there too.'
Of course, she wasn't a teammate back then.  She was actually closer to an enemy.  Still, she's quite nice, so we all managed to survive that fight.  
"Thersia, do you sense anyone's presence?"
"No."
"Good.  I don't sense anyone either.  Seems like they don’t patrol beyond this point, so let's pick up the pace.”
We resumed our journey with renewed speed, and soon the maze section ended, leading us to our destination. 
"This must be the Noark…!"
A vast cavern, so expansive it seemed impossible to be underground.
Versil exclaimed in amazement as he beheld the colossal stone gate, even grander than the royal palace gate.  
"Mr. Goulton, is this your first time here?"
"This is my first time coming so deep. I did participate in the first extermination, but as you know, we couldn’t even reach this place back then."
"Ah… I heard it was really bloody…"
As I listened to their conversation, I was reminded of a Canadian player I met in the community.  He had been dragged into the community when he was stabbed in the neck during a battle. 
'I promised to let him know when I went back…'
Funny how I completely forgot about him despite the fact that I still remember the address he gave me and the words he left behind.  He made quite an impression. 
"What’s the matter?  Not coming?"
"Ah, I’ll be there…”
Lost in my memories for a moment, I was startled by Amelia, who opened a side door subtly positioned next to the massive gate.  Versil tilted his head in confusion.
"Eh?  We’re not going through that gate?"
"No need. There are no guards, but is there any reason to take the hard way when there's a comfortable path?"
"That's true. But there are usually guards?"
"There were.  He wasn’t famous in Laphdonia, but he was one of the strongest fighters within Noark."
Amelia was about to step through the side door when…
"Hahaha! I appreciate you giving me such a grand title!"
A boisterous laugh erupted from behind us.
“!”
Erwin and Amelia, who had been completely oblivious to the presence, were startled and turned around.  I was no different.
"I wouldn’t have imagined encountering other guests in this place, especially such renowned figures!  I am Rex Aures, the former gatekeeper of Noark!"
The man, who had been obscured by his comrades, stood in the forefront, a figure as sturdy as a Barbarian.  His presence was far from subtle.  But the reason he could approach without us noticing was quite simple.  
Because [Dungeon & Stone] is a team game. 
"It’s fate that we’ve met, so let's greet each other!  Rex Aures, the former gatekeeper of Noark."
His companions emerged one by one, hiding behind the muscular man who stood in the front line. 
“And these are my comrades.”
‘One, two, three, four…’
A total of five. 
They outnumbered us, and even with a quality advantage on our side, it wouldn’t make much of a difference.  
Would it make sense if our team lost the quality advantage?  
Thud.
The world is all relative, after all. 
"Huh?  Baekho! Why are you so quiet today?  Didn’t you say you were friends with Baron Yandell?"
…To think I would run into these guys here.
