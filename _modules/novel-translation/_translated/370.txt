## The Black Star (3)
The claim that the Lion was Bjorn Jandel first emerged at this roundtable, voiced by the Soul Queen. The basis for this allegation was the Lion's disappearance immediately following Bjorn Jandel's death.  In simpler terms, it meant that if they could just solve the alibi issue, the matter would be resolved.
The moment the notion that the Lion was not Bjorn Jandel became an absolute premise, their suspicions lost much of their potency.
"Wasn't he said to have consumed the Ogre's essence?"
"I doubt he'd bother setting up a substitute and using a nickname."
"Then it would make sense that the Magician of Gold omitted this report."
"The possibility of a staged death exists."
These suspicions ultimately stemmed from the possibility that the Lion was Bjorn Jandel. The jester's reaction proved this.
"Pfft, what are you all talking about? Bjorn Jandel is dead."
Firmly believing that the Lion couldn't possibly be Bjorn Jandel, the jester was the only one who didn't react to these suspicions.
"Hmph, this guy is truly a different breed inside and out."
On the outside, I just want to smash his head in and kill him, but surprisingly, there's a charming side to him when we meet at the roundtable, I suppose? Ah, no time for such thoughts.  They seem to be getting back on track, I see. 
"..."
"..."
In the heavy silence, the Fox was the first to break the ice. 
"...22 years ago?" 
Her voice was tinged with an overwhelming shock that defied mere words.  It was only natural. 
"Th-th-that can't be right! If that's true, it means the Lion has been playing for over 20 years…"
As the goblin trailed off, the Deer Antler smoothly interjected.
"It's not impossible. GM, that's the time he was said to have been brought in, isn't it?"
The estimated time of entry, which could be considered a simultaneous start with GM, known as the longest-playing player. 
"Pfft, I wonder if I can become like the Lion if I kill people for another 10 years?"
Yes, jester, you've been playing for about 10 years, haven't you? The others seem to be around that time, too. 
"But Queen, why are you silent? Pfft."
The jester mocked the Soul Queen with a teasing remark. 
"Shouldn't you apologize, bow your head, and admit your mistake? The Lion is Bjorn Jandel? What kind of nonsense are you spreading?"
The jester, enjoying his position as the sole "truth teller," glanced at the other members.
"You're all the same! Bjorn Jandel? Even if he were somehow alive, could that weakling ever compare to the Lion? Huh?"
"Hahaha... It was just a thought. We didn't really believe it...," the goblin said awkwardly.
Deer Antler, on the other hand, didn't try to evade responsibility and reflected on his own words.
"In the first place… now that I think about it, it was a huge leap to assume that Bjorn Jandel was alive."
"...I honestly can't bring myself to believe that Bjorn Jandel was an evil spirit. The royal family's announcement also seemed a bit suspicious… I've actually met him before."
The Fox said she had met me personally? This woman was a high-ranking official who escaped through a dimensional portal, wasn't she? Hmmm, maybe she met me by chance, even if it wasn't then? 
'I'll think about this part later.'
The jester soon echoed the Fox's sentiment.
"Pfft, I agree. That clueless barbarian being an evil spirit? That's just ludicrous!"
This time, even Deer Antler, who had been at odds with the jester, uttered a word of agreement. 
"Indeed… that act he displayed at the investiture ceremony was hard to see as a performance."
"...You mean the incident where he pushed Duke Kudo in front of the Grand Chancellor, even with countless nobles watching?"
"Huhu, I heard about that later. He was shouting that the Duke was doing a forward roll at his expense, wasn't he?"
…How embarrassing. What does she mean by praising me so directly?
'Anyway, I think the suspicions are completely cleared up now.'
As I glanced around, the Soul Queen, still detached from the conversation, caught my eye.
'What is she thinking so intently?'
As I observed her, wondering about her inner thoughts, the jester changed the subject. 
"Queen, how long are you going to keep this up? It's your turn now. Don't you see the Lion waiting?"
Apparently, he misinterpreted my keen gaze at the Soul Queen.
This is ridiculous.  Why is he so eager to speak for me?
"A-ah! Yes. That's right… I should…,"
Whatever the reason, did the jester's urging have an effect?
The Soul Queen, as if regaining her composure, took a deep breath and slowly began to speak.
"...The royal family already knows GM's true identity."
This was an intriguing piece of information.  
***
The scholar, Yurven Havellion.  The head of a school and an idol to countless magic makers. This was just the surface story, however. His true identity was different. 
The Ghost Busters, the community of evil spirits. 
GM, the head of the community and a legendary figure among players.  That was his true identity.  
But…
Shooosh-!
The green light that illuminated the roundtable confirmed that the information the Soul Queen had revealed was true and something most were unaware of. 
"The royal family knowing his identity…"
This implied only one thing.
Beyond intentionally releasing GM—
"Then it's likely they were in a cooperative relationship, the royal family and GM."
It made sense. Their behavior during my confrontation with them, seemingly excluding any threat from the royal family, could now be explained. 
So, why did the Soul Queen reveal this information at the roundtable?
The reason became clear soon after.
"Pfft, so GM is a hypocrite, just like the rest of them. No wonder rumors about him never spread in the city, no matter how hard we tried."
It was likely a piece of advice and a warning. Don't waste your time spreading rumors. They'll be meaningless. 
"Wait a minute, but isn't this a bit strange? GM clearly defined the royal family as his enemy?"
The goblin pointed out the inconsistency, and the Crescent Moon sighed and replied. 
"Nothing is as meaningless as believing in forever. Even more so if the object of belief is a person."
Meaning that, while the early GM might have been different, no one knew if his purity had been preserved until now. 
"This could destroy the community itself."
The Deer Antler muttered in a tone of lament. 
"Yes, if news of GM siding with the royal family spreads, all the players will be in a state of panic. That goes for me too."
The Fox stared at the Soul Queen, drawing the other members' attention. 
"Queen, tell us. You're on the administration's side, aren't you? What was GM's intention in joining forces with the royal family?"
"I can't tell you that."
"So, you're telling us to interpret it ourselves—"
"But I can tell you this with certainty."
The Soul Queen cut off the Fox.
And…
"If the turn is over, let's start from me this time."
She then placed her hand on the gem at the center of the roundtable.
"GM acts and lives for the players more than anyone else."
"..."
"The royal family will never sacrifice any other player to him.  In fact, it's impossible with the functions of this community."
As she removed her hand from the gem, a green light emanated from it.
"Haha, I feel a bit more reassured now that you say that."
The goblin, uncomfortable with the awkward atmosphere, laughed to break the silence.  And with this, the atmosphere of interrogating the Soul Queen vanished.
"It's a good thing it's technically impossible."
That was the decisive factor. GM's heart could change in the future, but if they could technically avoid the worst-case scenario, their anxiety subsided.
"If GM had the authority to find out our identities, this situation wouldn't have happened…"
"It's more likely that he's in a give-and-take relationship with the royal family rather than being under them."
"So, it's your turn now."
The Soul Queen, unwilling to prolong the discussion on this topic, quickly wrapped it up and passed the turn to the jester.
"Pfft, since we heard such interesting stories from the start…"
The jester trailed off, as if choosing the information he would reveal. 
But did he quickly come up with something suitable?
"Aha, this is perfect!"
The jester clapped his hands exaggeratedly and placed his hand on the gem.
"...I only learned this recently, but it's quite an amazing story."
"You said dragging it out would only make you look pathetic."
"Pfft, but the goblin and I are different, aren't we?"
The jester shrugged, and Deer Antler nodded slightly. 
"Why are you nodding…,"
The goblin whined, as if hurt. 
But no one at the roundtable paid any attention to the goblin. After all, the jester had just begun to speak.
"The Dark Continent is a real place."
The jester's words, uttered in an excited tone, were difficult to comprehend.
"...It's green light, anyway."
"More importantly, what do you mean? I don't understand."
"Pfft! It's exactly what it sounds like!  I went out of the city and explored, and I realized that this land we stand on is eerily similar to the 7th Dark Continent, even if there might be slight differences in the terrain or structure!"
It was a piece of information that finally piqued the gamers' curiosity.  
"..."
"..."
"If this is true, then that hypothesis might be true too."
"The hypothesis that the labyrinth isn't a portal to another dimension, but a dimension created by someone?"
"The Crystal Cave, the Rock Desert… maybe they're all based on real places."
If that's truly the case, it's quite ironic. Someone created the labyrinth based on this world, and then someone else created the game based on the labyrinth city.  
'I'm curious about the outside world too.'
Will I get to explore that side someday?
***
The second round, which had started in reverse order, went smoothly without a single red light, but unfortunately, that was all. 
'The Queen and the jester were good, but the rest of the information wasn't really all that helpful.'
It wasn't about the objective value of the information; it was information that wasn't beneficial to me.  
Take the Fox, for example. 
The Fox received a green light for her information that the Blood Queen had purchased a mansion for a significant sum and had also taken out a large loan using the mansion as collateral.
Crescent Moon?
He sighed and said that the Blood Queen likely used that money to purchase essence.  
And...
"Buying essence after getting her a new home… pfft, that woman is really intense!  It's not like Bjorn Jandel will come back to life just because of that."
The reactions here were a bit hurtful.
"...Rihen Suitz, I don't know who he is, but he doesn't seem like a good guy."
"But he's really strong, isn't he? It seems like he'd need more than just a few essences to become that strong…"
"It's always the ones who already have it, isn't it?  To use a woman's wounds to get what he wants, what a disgrace to men."
"Oh my, Deer Antler, you're quite the romantic, aren't you?"
"Ahem…,"
"We should also investigate this matter on the Fairy race level. We only knew that she bought essence; we didn't know she gave it to someone else…"
Ugh, this means I'm going to be investigated everywhere after the roundtable is over.
'If I could just access the Explorer Guild's data, I could feel a bit more reassured.'
I need to find an answer as soon as possible.
"Haha, it's already my turn!"
Anyway, the goblin and the Deer Antler, who followed after, weren't much different in their situations.  Like the two pieces of information before, while not related to me, they didn't feel like essential information.
'Well, you can't expect to get only useful information every time.'
With a lingering sense of disappointment, I glanced around.
Was it because it was my turn already?
The atmosphere in the room was different from before.
"..."
Everyone's eyes gathered, anticipating what information I would bring.  The air was so quiet that the word 'quiet' couldn't even describe it.
And in that silence…
'What should I do…'
I pondered one last time.  
However, I never once considered changing what I had already decided.  
I opened my mouth.
"I've met the creator of [Dungeon and Stone], Auril Gavison."
This is something that needs to be hammered in for sure.
"..."
"..."
So that they wouldn't even think about the Lion being Bjorn Jandel.
***
"Ugh, I'm tired…"
As soon as I returned to my room, I threw myself onto the bed and closed my eyes, recalling what had happened at the roundtable. 
'I guess it's been a while since we went for three rounds.'
We had a third round even after completing the two initial rounds.  
There was some useful information, but most of it wasn't really all that important.  
Therefore...
"It's not like anything changes with one less goblin. Everyone else, just keep going, yeah?"
"It's not like something exciting is going to come up anyway."
I stood up, coldly ignoring the jester's disappointed look. 
After all, if the goblin left, the majority rule wouldn't apply, would it?  
As always, at this point, even if I didn't take the lead, one or two more people would leave.  I thought it was better to make the first move.
'…The fact that we wouldn't get any high-level information is probably true.'
Okay, resting for a bit got my head back in the game. 
I'll just surf the web to kill time for the rest of the day.  
Click, click.
I got up from the bed and started browsing through the community posts.
"Kkhkh, these crazy fools…"
It's just a trolling comment, but why is it so funny?  What's wrong with their brains?
"Kkkeuk…"
As I sat with one leg resting on the table, I was scrolling through the internet, chuckling away, when...
"...Huh?"
I quickly adjusted my posture.  
Even when I rubbed my eyes and leaned forward, the words on the monitor didn't change. 
[Korea Independence Forever] - 1 person is currently online.
Online?  Who is it?  
Could it be Lee Baekho?
No, GM wouldn't have unbanned him already…
'Even if he were unbanned, it's impossible for him to log in right now.'
Maybe it's someone who just logged in to kill time?
Or a real Korean? 
'…Maybe there was a Korean among the newcomers recently.'
Whatever the reason, I'll find out when I meet them.
With that in mind, I double-clicked the mouse.  
And…
Click, click.
My vision turned white, and the space around me transformed.  
Instead of the default chatroom space, which was just an empty lot or field, I was in a lavishly decorated noble mansion.  
The place Lee Baekho, the room owner, had personally decorated.  
'What the heck, it's a woman?'
I could see the side profile of a woman sitting in front of the fireplace.  
[HS123]
While I couldn't tell her nationality from her nickname alone, it was clear she was East Asian based on her hair color and complexion.
Hmmm, so she's a real Korean then?
'Well, I'll know when I talk to her.'
While I'd prefer a guy, I'm not not happy to see a woman.
If she's a fellow Korean, I'm willing to lend a hand, just like Lee Baekho did for me.
Thinking that, I made my presence known.
"Kkhm, khm."
"Yik!"
The woman sitting there flinched, her shoulders trembling.  
It seemed she was unaware that I had entered the chatroom…  She had the strong aura of a true newbie, something that couldn't be faked with acting—
"...Uh?"
The woman startled, turned around, and our eyes met. 
And at that moment.
"Uh…?"
"Uh."
The woman's eyes widened.  
No, my eyes widened too, to be honest.
"Uhhh?"
What is this?  
Is this a dream? 
Why is she here? 
"Uh…"
My thoughts stalled.
My mouth gaped open, flapping like a goldfish, unable to produce any coherent sounds.  
The same was true for her.
"Uh, uh."
"Uh…"
"Uhhh?"
But she recovered faster than me.
"Hansoo… oppa…?"
She asked with a look of surprise, more than joy. 
"Hyeonbyeol…?"
I asked back, dazed, while looking down at her.
She was wearing a neat blouse and a formal skirt that reached her knees. And…
"Hah… You haven't changed a bit, oppa?"
...She was wearing black stockings.
