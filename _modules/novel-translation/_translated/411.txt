##  A Legacy of Bitter Fate (1)
When despair struck, most people instinctively turn to hope.
"If I do this, and then this, and then this..."
They convince themselves that all will be well.  They endlessly speculate about hypothetical situations, blinded by the faintest possibility, losing precious time in the process.
Years, even decades.
Though we had stumbled through a labyrinth of dangers, our expedition remained a single entity, a collective of individuals bound by a common fate.
"You're saying we're leaving?" 
My decision, announced to the group, was met with immediate disquiet.
"A rash decision, Captain!"
"But surely we should wait here a little longer? Maybe something happened on their end, and they're just delayed?"
"Indeed! The Noark bastards are everywhere! How far can we possibly go on our own?"
The dissent spread like wildfire.
Understandably so.
It was the most hopeful option.
If the rescue team arrived, everyone would return alive.
The crisis would be over, and we would go back to the city and our lives, the hardships we endured merely a tale to share over drinks.
But...
'It's dangerous.'
I knew.
That the situation wasn't yet truly desperate. 
Real despair would come when our window of opportunity closed, and even this flickering ember of hope was snuffed out.
At that point, there would be nothing left to do.
Therefore, if we were to act, now was the time.
"What are you all talking about? Have you all lost your minds?"
I used strong language, knowing it would provoke a backlash.
A shock tactic.
"There was a mole in the Ice Rock. When we reached the Celestial Eye, we couldn't get through, no matter how many times we tried. And now?"
"..."
"Three days have passed, and there's still no word. Just a little delay? They're on their way? That's ridiculous. If they were, there wouldn't be Noark bastards swarming around here. They would've been recalled to the front lines to stop the royal forces."
I paused, letting the gravity of my words sink in.
"Listen carefully, everyone."
"..."
"We've been abandoned."
Though I didn't truly believe it.
I judged that this level of bluntness was necessary to shatter their false hopes.
"Why would the royal family abandon us?"
Well, I don't know either.
Perhaps they truly had a pressing issue preventing their arrival.
I believed that possibility was more likely.
But so what?
Their circumstances don't change the outcome.
"If they hadn't abandoned us, why haven't they come yet?"
"That's..."
The team member who trailed off clenched his jaw.
"So you're saying we should move?"
"Yes."
"All of us, in this weakened state? Do you think we stand a chance? We'll all die—!"
"What's the difference if we stay here?"
The voices grew louder, but the mages had activated ‘Voice Control’ with their depleted mana, allowing me to shout back without hesitation.
"Open your eyes!"
"..."
"No matter how we spin it, the fact remains they're not coming to save us!"
My shout silenced the entire group.
They couldn't refute it. Not truly.
They felt it in their hearts.
The possibility of my statement being true.
If they hadn't harbored those doubts, they wouldn't be this anxious now.
"..."
"..."
In the silence that followed, I spoke.
"I have no intention of dying in this place."
"..."
"Do you?"
The Kaislan team member responded.
"...Who wants to die?"
"Then that settles it. Follow me. Kill the enemy, protect your comrades. At least, it's more meaningful than waiting here for death to come."
I said, glancing at the team members sitting on the thick branches.
Their expressions didn't suggest my words had resonated deep within them.
Naturally, it was to be expected.
Rhien Schuitz.
An unknown explorer, someone they had never met before joining the expedition.
Even if I showed various aspects of myself here, how trustworthy could I be in this situation?
Their eyes naturally turned to their respective team leaders.
And then...
"Let us follow the path illuminated by the Light."
It was Jun who stepped forward first.
He looked at me with excessive formality, as if he was trying to assist me or perhaps appear divine.
"The Fourth Team will walk alongside you in the hardship you've chosen."
Next came Kaislan.
"The Raffdonia Royal Family has appointed Rhien Schuitz as the leader of this expedition. Questioning his judgment or expressing disagreement could be construed as disloyalty to the royal family."
His lengthy speech could be summarized in a single sentence.
"The Fifth Team will follow your command."
Was it an attempt to empower me, just like Jun?
Kaislan, kneeling on the uncomfortable branches, bowing his head all the way down to his knee.
That was unexpected.
During the leadership council, he looked at me with displeasure.
"The Second Team is a bit different."
Akuraba spoke then.
"It's not about blind faith or fear of the royal family's martial law. I simply agree with this man. It seems the royal family won't be able to come to our rescue."
"So?"
Akuraba smirked at my prompting.
"The Second Team will also follow you."
Okay, only one team left.
The third team led by James Kalla, the vice-commander of the Sawtooth Clan.
All eyes turned to him, and James Kalla wore a flustered expression.
"I..."
He seemed overwhelmed by the performance of the previous team leaders.
Perhaps he thought it didn't suit him?
"Same here. It's not like anything will change just because I'm the only one who objects. An ordinary person like me always has to go with the flow."
It was a bit boring, but a typical response from this guy.
His straightforwardness, sprinkled with a hint of humor, seemed to resonate well with the other team members.
"..."
"We're already screwed."
"What do you mean, 'already decided'? What are we supposed to do?"
"Haha, I never liked them anyway. How many times have they let me down? I'll find my own way."
"I'll make sure to give the royal family a piece of my mind. But first, we have to get out of here alive."
I clenched my fist as I glanced at the murmuring team members.
Tightly.
Alright, let's do this.
***
"We spotted more patrol troops. They must've realized they're dead. What should we do?"
What should we do?
The plan going forward is simple.
"We're using the multi-teleportation magic."
First, we're escaping from the heart of enemy territory using the mass teleport.
Sure, it's not completely without issues...
"After such a large-scale spell, the mages will be incapacitated for a while. Our location will be exposed."
Noark's scouts will definitely follow the lingering magical aura and track us down.
But we have no other choice.
"There's no other option than to take the risk. No matter how stealthily we move, it's impossible for this many people to avoid detection."
"That's true, but..."
"Since the Celestial Eye is destroyed, they can't communicate freely. Using the multi-teleportation magic to gain distance is the best option."
The team leaders expressed some concerns about my decision, but they didn't voice them aloud.
Okay, that issue's solved.
"What's next?"
The plan going forward is also quite straightforward.
"Whether they pursue us or not, we're heading north."
Our destination: the northern hemisphere of the Dark Continent.
"...Not the south where our allies are?"
"Yes."
There's one reason why we chose the north over the south.
The scouts can only track where we teleport to.
They won't know where we'll go next.
Simply put...
"You're trying to mislead them by making them think we're heading south. If they send their troops south, the north will be wide open."
"That's right. We'll hide in plain sight, right under their noses. Until the closing day."
"Understood. Did you come up with this too, Captain?"
I can't believe you think I came up with this.
Fine, it's not important anyway.
"Everyone, get ready. Once the magical chant starts, the Noark bastards will swarm like a pack of dogs."
"..."
I shared the strategy with the team leaders, and each of them relayed the instructions to their members.
All preparations are complete for the execution of the plan.
Thud.
We descended from the tree where we were hiding.
There's no way we can hide using magic while the mass teleport spell is being cast.
"It feels strange to be walking on solid ground again after three days."
For a moment, I felt unfamiliar with the sensation of the ground beneath my feet. The five mages in the expedition immediately split up and began drawing the magic circle on the ground.
Woooosh—!
Two multi-teleportation spells are needed to transport 28 people.
With such a vast amount of mana being used, anyone with keen senses will notice the anomaly.
Ah, please, let it be even a little late.
"..."
We faced the giant tree, with the mages at the center, forming a semi-circular protective formation.
"Captain, someone's coming. They're moving extremely fast."
Erwen, who had exceptional senses, muttered in a low voice.
A while passed.
"...They stopped after seeing us. They're turning back now, rushing in the opposite direction."
Right, they're going to call for reinforcements.
Woooosh—!
Before I could give any orders, Erwen fired an arrow towards the dark forest.
But...
"Did you kill them?"
"No. It hit a tree."
"I see."
It wouldn't have mattered even if she'd hit them. We would've just bought some time.
I licked my lips and yelled.
"All units, prepare for battle!"
There's no need to keep silent when we've already been spotted, right?
The Noark bastards will come swarming in, excited to take us down.
And we'll hold them off until the mass teleport spell is complete.
Swoosh.
Taking advantage of the relative calm, I checked behind us one last time.
"Coordinates! This coordinate input is wrong!"
"Ah, I apologize. I'll fix it now!"
The mages, realizing the urgency of the situation, drew the magic circle with more haste than ever before.
I appreciate their efforts, but I can't deny my regret.
'...How I wish it was the Dimensional Gate magic.'
Of course, it's unavoidable.
In the original game, only a grand mage who had reached the first tier could use the 'Dimensional Gate' spell. And the price to pay was the caster's life.
The Dimensional Gate commonly used in the current labyrinth is an improved version of the original.
Or rather, a downgraded version.
The improved Dimensional Gate can be used even by a fourth-tier mage.
Furthermore, it can be used only once in a lifetime, and it doesn't necessarily result in death.
But...
'It can't be used on the 7th floor or above.'
The improved version of the Dimensional Gate has this crucial penalty. That's why I'm feeling regretful about another aspect.
'...I should've tried to get a first-tier mage.'
I requested it, but it was rejected by the Viscount.
First-tier mages are incredibly rare, even in the Tower of Mages. The royal family has only one.
Even if we destroy the Celestial Tower and the entire expedition returns alive, if a first-tier mage dies, it's a huge loss.
Unless the entire expedition is sacrificed.
'Damn it, is this really it?'
The thought crossed my mind, but I shook my head.
The premise itself is flawed, isn't it?
It's wrong to put a first-tier mage and the lives of our expedition on the same scale.
Ultimately, the final plan involved sending the main force to rescue us, didn't it?
Of course, the rescue force would suffer casualties, but considering the prestige of the expedition members, the royal family could easily accept that sacrifice.
So, the reason the rescue force isn't coming is—
'...Let's just stop thinking about it.'
Why didn't the rescue force come?
It was a question that had plagued my mind countless times, but I decided to stop thinking about it now.
It's not like we won't know the answer if we return alive...
"They're coming..."
And if we don't return alive, knowing the answer won't change anything.
Boom, Boom.
I felt a slight vibration through the ground.
"Woooooo!"
"Kill them!"
As soon as the enemy emerged from the darkness, I cleared my mind.
Now is the time to think about only one thing.
「The character has cast [Gigantification].」
「The character has used a Transformation-type ability.」
「The [Primordial Cells] effect reduces the Soul Power consumption of the skill by half and increases the highest stat by 1.5 times.」
Survival.
