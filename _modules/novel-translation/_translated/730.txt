## The Betrayer (4)
Inspiration.
A sudden, brilliant idea or stimulus that sparks creative work.
"Good idea…? What is it?"
Seeing Raven's slightly anxious expression, I grinned.
As for the philosopher who yelled "Eureka!" after stepping into the bath, these inspirations suddenly strike unexpectedly, just like now.
Right now, as it happens.
[Tura, Piare, Buamine Yandel, Harpu.]
"Requesting immediate support, Sector 8, arson, perpetrator is Yandel."
The goal is simple.
To draw attention, allowing Amelia to escape more easily from Sector 4. 
And, in a sense, drawing attention was something that both Bjorn Yandel and ‘Lee Hansoo’ excelled at.
It's a talent everyone has, a basic skill for any ordinary man in South Korea who's poured their teens and twenties into gaming.
[Tura No, Tekkai, Jigenu, Remgak.]
"Sector 8-2, access restricted, support forces are en route."
Besides, this isn't my first rodeo.
Sure, my body is stronger now, so my brain has to deal with less stress. Back in the days when I was so weak that a breeze could knock me over, I had to use all my knowledge of ‘Lee Hansoo’ to draw attention.
Yes, so…
"Vivian."
I made one final confirmation.
"Can we send that message?"
"Yes, but there's a high chance of my line being cut off, as it's sure to draw attention."
Right, so it works?
I was secretly worried it wouldn't, but that final hurdle had been cleared.
"So... what should we send?"
Vivian seemed quite curious about my "good idea." I simply said,
"You'll understand when you hear it."
"... What?"
"Translate what I'm about to say into code. Not a single word should be omitted."
"Oh! Wait a second!"
Vivian adjusted her crystal pendant as if making some kind of adjustment, then confirmed that she was ready.
Now it's time to send my message to all the commanders of Noah's Ark.
"Ricardo Luehenpraha."
I spoke slowly.
"Mom."
"... What?"
"Not here."
It's time to go back to basics.

*Crackle—*
Numerous messages crackled through the crystal communication pendant strapped to his waist, but the man barely paid attention, listening with one ear.
[Requesting immediate support, Sector 8, arson, perpetrator is Yandel.]
‘That guy’ had appeared in Sector 8 and was wreaking havoc.
[Sector 8-2, access restricted, support forces are on standby.]
The situation seemed quite serious, but…
*Thud—*
It wasn't something he should get involved in.
He was in Sector 4, quite far from Sector 8 anyway.
Unless he was specifically requested for support, he intended to let them handle it.
Yes, he had definitely decided to let them handle it.
[Ricardo Luehenpraha.]
Until that familiar female voice reached his ears.
‘Riranne Vivian…?’
He knew instantly who it was.
After all, he was the one who personally brought that young girl, filled only with malice, and nurtured her growth until she became known as the ‘Screaming Witch.’
‘She's in Sector 8… and calling me…?’
It seemed like a request for support.
‘Could she be in danger?’
He thought as much, but even if that was the case, he couldn't go.
It was wartime.
And ultimately, he had gathered everyone, one by one, to form ‘Orcullis’, all for this day.
[Mom…?]
…Even if the situation was dire enough for her to call for her mother, nothing would change.
*Thud—*
There were more important things right now.
He should pretend not to hear this request and ignore it—
[Not here…!!]
…?
"..."
His mind went blank for a moment, his feet momentarily halting.
However, he quickly started walking again, thinking that he had heard wrong or she had spoken incorrectly.
But it didn’t take long for his steps to stop again.
The voice began to flow out once more.
[Ricardo Luehenpraha! Mom, not here!]
The message repeating itself, confirming that he hadn't misheard.
The man was genuinely confused, encountering this situation for the first time in his life.
What was going on?
He couldn’t understand, but the message continued.
[The Rose Knights….]
"..."
[They’re going to kill her! That’s why Mom is not here!]
The content was so shocking, so surreal, it made his head spin. But it also chilled him to the bone.
He was smart enough to recognize this.
‘…She’s being forced to send this message.’
Riranne Vivian didn’t want to send this message.
It was highly likely she was captured and forced to send these messages.
But the problem was different.
‘…Who is it?’
Who was sending these messages, for what reason, and how did they know about the feud between him and the Rose Knights?
It was a story known to very few people.
*Thud*
His priorities shifted in his mind.
Chasing the woman who was Bjorn Yandel's companion and used similar aura to the Rose Knights was important, but…
"Captain…?"
"I'll leave the pursuit of Emily Rains to you."
"Yes, sir…!"
He decided to leave the pursuit to his subordinates for the moment, pulled out the crystal pendant from his waist, and activated it.
[Ricardo Luehenpraha characteristic 1, he’s smaller than the Corpse Collector….]
There was only one way to find out who was forcing Vivian to spout such nonsensical words.
To speak directly to them.
[…Who are you?]
He spoke into the activated pendant, his voice low.
But the only answer he received was ridicule.
[Ricardo Luehenpraha characteristic 2, you’re not scary at all, but you’re all about pretending to be tough….]
It seemed inconvenient to translate everything into code, so he dropped the code and continued to mock him in the language of Laphdonia.
A certain figure flashed in his mind.
The Dragon Slayer, Regal Vagos.
The Corpse Collector, Avet Necrapeto.
The Eye, Roland Banozant.
All the people he had encountered personally, as if in unison, had advised him to ‘be careful what you say’.
"Bjorn Yandel…."
If it was really him, his actions made sense.
He was chasing his companion at the moment.
Inside information leaked, and he used this to draw attention to himself? It was a perfectly plausible scenario, but…
‘If so… how does he know about what happened between me and the Rose Knights?’
He didn’t know, so he gripped the pendant again.
[Ricardo Luehenpraha characteristic 3, you tremble so hard you can’t say anything….]
The mockery continued, but the man didn’t care.
He was even more calm than usual.
His breath was just a little rough and his body was trembling because he had run for a while.
[…Where are you?]
He asked again, wanting to confirm who it was. Fortunately, the answer came instantly.
This time, it wasn’t Vivian’s voice.
[Sector 8.]
A deep voice that conjured up the image of a sturdy build, just from hearing it.
[If you’re so tough, come and get me.]
He was a man, and the message mentioned Sector 8, where Yandel was spotted.
‘My prediction was right.’
Of course, he was still bewildered.
[Ricardo Luehenpraha characteristic 4, you only ask where they are and cower too much to actually go.]
Where on earth was this the kind of speech someone who was the hero of the city, the leader of a species, and even held the title of Baron would utter?
It was too frivolous and vulgar for that.
But that’s why the opponent’s intention became even clearer.
‘He probably intends to lure me out.’
Now, what should I do?
He didn’t have to think long.
[Ricardo Luehenpraha characteristic 5, no father either.]
He didn’t like the idea of falling for this obvious trick, but…
[Don’t think about dying peacefully.]
Maybe I should give him the benefit of the doubt.
I’m curious to know how he learned that.
[Oh, you’re like your parents?]
The moment the mockery continued, the pendant in the man’s hand couldn’t withstand the pressure and shattered.
"Must have been defective."
He envisioned the fastest route to Sector 8.
But somehow, the words the guy had said kept replaying in his head.
No, it was the ‘voice’ that was echoing.
[Sector 8, if you’re so tough, come and get me.]
He had heard countless stories about Bjorn Yandel, but this was the first time he had actually spoken to him.
But why?
‘Something… feels familiar….’
There was a strange sense of deja vu.
It was as if he had heard this exact same voice before, a long time ago, a time he couldn’t quite remember.
‘When was it…?’
The man furrowed his brow, trying to recall the memory, but his steps began to quicken.
No matter what this feeling was.
*Thud—*
He would know when he met him in person.
***
Have you ever been inside a closet?
Sven Parav, the (former) knight of Laphdonia, had.
To be precise, it wasn't ‘Sven Parav’ who went inside the closet, but his original body, but anyway…
"..."
"..."
If you’re in a closet, you have to hunch over, you can’t straighten your neck, and the floor isn’t as soft as a bed.
But it's surprisingly comfortable.
No, to be precise, it's not your body that's comfortable, but your heart.
Because, if you’re in here, nobody can find you.
That’s why he’d always go inside the closet when he was scared.
‘I never thought I’d be coming back to this, at this age.’
He was crammed inside the closet, his body having grown much larger.
He wasn’t alone, either.
"I, I’m sorry… are you uncomfortable with how heavy I am?"
He had a roommate, and the sweet scent coming from that roommate forced him to lean further back in the cramped closet.
But he had no choice.
This was the only place nearby he could hide.
"Oh, no… I'm the one who’s sorry. It’s because of me…."
"... Don't apologize. We’re both still safe."
Sven Parav felt immense gratitude at those words.
It was all his fault he was stuck in this cramped closet.
In the middle of a crucial battle with his comrades, he had a seizure, and Ririss Marone got caught up trying to save him.
"It’s strange, though… How did you suddenly feel better, after coming into here?"
"Haha… I, I don't know."
Sven Parav chuckled awkwardly and changed the subject.
He felt both sorry and grateful, but there was a secret he couldn’t reveal to her.
‘…I can’t tell her it was intentional, not for the life of me.’
It was an exaggerated performance, a fake seizure.
He did it to naturally detach from the group.
‘Why this closet…?
’Sven Parav stroked the side of the closet, wondering.
There was nothing special about it, externally.
The abandoned house looked ordinary from any angle.
And the closet, seen through the broken window on the second floor, was only visible from its upper section.
But as soon as he saw the closet in the midst of the battle, an overwhelming ‘intuition’ gripped him.
‘I need to go.’
This closet is safe.
I will never die as long as I’m in this closet.
‘I need to go.’
As if possessed, Sven Parav detached from the group.
He had to pretend to have a seizure because of Ririss Marone, who saw him and followed, but anyway.
This closet was worth going to these lengths for.
It was like some kind of cure-all.
*Thud—*
The chronic anxiety that had taken over his body since he returned to the city had vanished, and he had a strong sense of security—that he would be safe even if the world collapsed, as long as he was in here.
‘…I’m sorry to my comrades.’
This could be seen as a betrayal of his comrades.
He felt guilty, but Sven Parav couldn’t bring himself to leave the closet.
‘As long as I’m in this closet, I can live…!’
For Sven Parav, intuition was something he had to follow.
Absolutely.
