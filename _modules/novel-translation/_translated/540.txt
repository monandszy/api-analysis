## The Wall of Aegis
No. 7777, Garpas's Necklace.  It wasn't really an efficient item, though it guaranteed a Number Item above No. 35.  You had to invest a whopping 1.5 billion stones to reach that point, though.
"It's only worthwhile if a single-number item drops."
If a 'Ten Number' (No. 10-19) appeared, it'd be close to breaking even.  Anything above No. 20 usually resulted in a loss.  There was also the risk of the necklace exploding during reroll, leading to catastrophic losses.  It was a risky gamble of an item, basically...
"Bjorn...? Why are you silent?"
I snapped out of my thoughts as I saw Einar, her expression filled with concern.
"Is something wrong?"
Nothing was wrong.  Quite the opposite.
"Good job, Einar. You're the only one I can rely on."
I expressed my sincere affection, but Einar ignored it completely.
"Oh! If you say so, then this must be a good item! So, what's this shield about?"
Ah, that.  While Einar's reaction stung a little, it was a minor issue.  I mean, I almost got devoured by that Abyssal Claw, after all.  To be honest, I'd even laugh off three punches to the face, no questions asked.  And speaking of, 'Let's pull it out.'
I quickly pulled out the item contained within the necklace before any other variables could arise. 
Swoosh-! 
A kaleidoscope of light erupted the moment I pressed the confirmation button.  The light swirled in the air, coalescing like clay, taking shape.
"A designated item has been created."
No. 3, Aegis's Wall.  In-game, it's called The Wall of Aegis.  The undisputed graduation shield for shield-wielding barbarians.  'Now I only need one shield, so does this mean I've graduated from shield-farming?'
Actually, I'd hoped for something else.  Or rather, I'd been hoping for something that would be realistic and allow me to stop.  Something like a ten-digit armor for me, or a No. 21 shield, the second graduation shield.  A single-digit Number Item for a frost dual-wielding swordsman would be amazing, too.  If a 'Rift Generator' had dropped, I would've chosen it, knowing the future benefits.  Even if it wasn't that, I was willing to stop if a graduation weapon for Erwen or Amelia had dropped.  But...
'Could I actually get this?'
I still couldn't tell if I was dreaming or awake.
"The Garpas's power imbued in the necklace has been permanently damaged due to the excessive concentration of magical energy."
One of the Number Items had been reduced to a regular necklace, but it was hardly a loss. 
I cautiously lifted the gray shield.
"The character has equipped No. 3, Aegis's Wall."
"The character's overall item level has increased by +18,600."
I was stronger.  Much stronger.

The shield itself was far from flashy.  It was gray, for one, and lacked any gem-like decorations.  But who cares?  A shield just needs to be sturdy.
"This shield... Is it a single-number item?"
"Wait a minute... If it's No. 3, that means there are only two shields above this... This is a treasure beyond compare!"
"Aegis's Wall! To actually see the legendary shield I've only heard about!"
My comrades were buzzing with excitement after discovering the true identity of the shield.  Amelia, of all people, seemed the most elated.
"Oh! Everyone seems to be impressed, so this must be quite a treasure!"
"Tsk, it's not just 'quite a treasure.'  Aegis's Wall hasn't been seen since a certain explorer died in the Labyrinth 120 years ago."
Well, it wasn't really a surprise anymore.  This girl absolutely loves these things.  A complete Labyrinth nerd, you could call her.
"The only other one besides the one owned by the royal family is the one Jandel, that kid, has.  By the way, according to records, this shield is indestructible."
Was she trying to show off her knowledge?  Amelia explained the equipment's options to everyone, stepping in for me.  The explanation was fairly professional, but...
'The information in this world always lacks precise numbers.'
It's unacceptable for someone like me, a hardcore gamer.  So, let me clarify:
'Top-tier indestructible.'
'When using 'guard' with the shield, immune to all damage.'
'Reduces all magical damage received by the user and their allies within a 10-meter radius by 30%, and grants immunity to 5th-tier magic and below.'
'Increases all defense-related stats of the wearer by 20%.'
'When using Aura skills, the radius and effects are doubled.'
'When the threat level reaches 500 or above, all monsters prioritize attacking the user.'
And lastly, 'One active skill effect.'
Damn, this is what a graduation item should be.  My heart is pounding so hard.  Should I just grab this and go out to fight right now?  I'm itching to get into action, but I told them today was a day off, so I had to resist.  Well, I do need some time to adapt.
'It's incredibly light.'
Is it because the one I was using before was absurdly heavy?  It's much heavier than a normal steel shield, but it feels considerably lighter.
'Should I try out the hammer?'
I held the Devil Crusher in my other hand and checked the weight balance.  I'm not in a simple game world.  Even a minor difference in feel and weight could lead to a serious disaster.
Whoosh! Whoosh! 
I swung my weapons in the air, adapting to the change in weight, all alone in the cave.  Then a thought struck me.
'How come I finished the weapon side of my build first?'
No. 87, Kraul's Devil Crusher, and No. 3, Aegis's Wall.  Those two are pretty much it for weapons.  The Devil Crusher still has room for upgrade, but considering its acquisition difficulty, I might as well call this a weapon graduation.  'All that's left is armor, shoes, and a belt.'
At least, that's the case for the core items crucial for building my character.  The Barbarian's Genesis Amulet is also a core item, but that's impossible to get now.  It's a shame, really.  The Genesis Amulet is part of what makes shield-wielding barbarians OP.  'Anyway, I think I'm getting used to it.'
After getting used to my new gear, I started experimenting.  I tried out the active skill effect, checked the performance of the magic-immune aura on the shield.  And...
'10-meter radius...,'
I got a firm grasp of that 10-meter distance.  I have a hunch it'll be essential somewhere.
After all that, I took a break, and the leadership council met to discuss the future exploration plans.  But it was more of a briefing than a discussion.
"Lord Bjorn, are we resuming the Giant Island exploration tomorrow?"
"No, we're putting that on hold for now."
"What?"
"We've been searching for a while now, but we haven't found anything."
I know there's a secret hidden on Giant Island.  But to uncover it, we'll probably have to defeat that colossal Giant we saw.  The problem is...
'I haven't seen it since then, and I'm not sure if we can even win if we do find it.'
"Where are we going then?"
"Our next destination is the Library Island."
"What? Oh, you mean the island you mentioned earlier?"
"Yes."
I plan to level up on that island first.  Previously, we could only hunt up to 3rd-tier monsters due to our limited numbers, but things are different now.  I'm also a bit curious to see how things have changed over time.
'I cleared almost all the books on the lower levels back then. I wonder if they've respawned?'
Well, I guess I'll find out when we get there.
As the meeting was about to end, Amelia raised a question to me.
"Jandel, are we giving up on Hipramajant?"
"We're not giving up, just putting it on hold for now."
"Why? I remember you were eager for its essence."
Well, yeah.  But I'm not confident we can get past the three-fold probability: a successful warp magic, an essence drop, and that essence being [Gigantification].  Even if we manage to overcome that probability, the immediate returns are low.  'No matter how I think about it, I don't think the skill will stack.'
Hipramajant's essence is a substitute essence, a superior version of the Orc Hero essence.  And I have two essence slots remaining.  It'd be more beneficial to fill them with other essences for power increase.  It's not like I can immediately swap the Orc Hero essence for Hipramajant's essence even if we get it.  But...
"Hmm, I see. I understand."
To be honest, this is just a secondary reason, not the main one.  'I've taken care of Erwen and Einar, so...'
The remaining comrades need to level up too.  Don't they all still have an essence slot free?  We'll be able to fill them up during farming on the Library Island.  Oh, and Amelia is included, of course.  'She's been stagnant for too long.'
"...What kind of look is that?"
"Nothing."
Just thinking.  I don't know when we'll be able to escape from here, but when that day comes...
'This will be fun.'
How much stronger will we be by then?
***
After sharing our exploration plans, I spent the rest of the time pondering my future build.  What should I do to become a bigger and stronger shield-wielding barbarian?  I prioritized what needed to be done and made a step-by-step plan.
There was one thing I could do right now on the first floor:  get an essence on the Library Island.  And my target essence is just one:  Bellarios, a 3rd-tier monster.  That's all I need for now, and the next level-up will have to wait until after we escape.  Swap the Orc Hero essence for Hipramajant's essence.  Max out Soul Carving to level 9.  Farm 2nd-tier Guardian essences and Number Items on the 8th-floor Rift.  Then, erase the Stormgush essence and farm Floor Essences.
I can't attempt any of that until we get back to the city.  And so, after our day off...
Day 75.
As soon as the day began, I left the cave.  I headed toward the coast to go to the Library Island.  I was about to summon a ship when...
Swoosh-!
Something flew out of the water at high speed.
"Defense successful."
"Aegis's Wall absorbed all damage."
Thankfully, I instinctively raised my shield to block it.  But what was that?
"An ambush!"
My comrades panicked at the sudden attack, but I checked below, ignoring them.  I saw a red spear lying on the sandy beach, where silvery waves were retreating.
'Green Spear...?  What the heck?'
Why is that here?  The question didn't last long.
"The Heavenly Spear Keeper, Milaiel, has cast [Return]."
In the distance, something slowly emerged from the receding silvery waves, walking towards me.  And...
"The Heavenly Spear Keeper, Milaiel, has retrieved Green Spear."
"The power of [Return] will slightly increase until the battle ends."
The spear keeper picked up the spear lying on the ground and spoke to me.
"I won't miss you, mortal."
I'd heard that line countless times when escaping earlier, but this time it felt different.
'...Is this guy crazy?'
Did he swim across the ocean to get here?
***
The Heavenly Spear Keeper, Milaiel.  A Rift Guardian appearing in the City of Light, Kalheum.  The first emotion I felt when I saw him again in an unexpected place was shock.  But once I calmed down, a different feeling arose.  Joy.  And...
"This is good."
Excitement.
"I thought I'd never see you again."
"I won't miss you, mortal."
I grinned as I saw Milaiel, stubbornly repeating the same line.  'Don't make me laugh, I'm not even thinking about running anymore.'
Back then, Erwen was unable to fight.  We were surrounded by monsters, and you never knew when a 2nd-tier or higher monster would pop up.  We had to make a full-on dash toward the coast.  But now, things are different.  I don't know if this dumb bastard knows that, though.  The rain season is long gone.  And I've got a new shield now.  So, you could say...
'A combat power gauge would be great.'
I shouted at my comrades, who were seemingly awaiting my orders.
"Combat ready! We'll kill him right here!"
Of course, you can't just kick a pumpkin that rolled in.
