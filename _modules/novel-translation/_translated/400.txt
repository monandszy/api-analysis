##  Chapter 400: Ice Rock (1)
The Grand Expedition to the Dark Continent, venturing past the 8th floor. We allotted 20 days to traverse Ice Rock, and packed enough supplies for three months. It wasn’t a matter of over-preparing for any unforeseen events. Ice Rock was not a place one could afford to be leisurely. It simply demanded sufficient rations. 
Here, food consumption was three times the usual due to the [Famine] effect, and there was always the risk of spoilage. All thanks to this accursed phenomenon:
“Ice storm!”
A blizzard that blew in every 30 minutes to 6 hours, with a fickle frequency.
“Field effect - ‘Pustulent Chill’ activated.”
“The decay rate of affected targets is accelerated.”
This maddening storm could spoil even frozen food. The only solution? Prioritizing food over our own comfort, and shielding it with magic. 
Naturally, this presented its own challenges.
“Riard Ashid has cast the 4th-grade Spatial magic, [Barrier].”
“Mckelly Reiadirs has cast the 4th-grade Spatial magic, [Barrier].”
“Vercile Goulond has cast the 4th-grade Spatial magic, [Barri……”
The mana expenditure for the 4th-grade [Barrier] was significant. Maintaining constant readiness for its use further exacerbated the already substantial drain. Even at night, shifts were a necessity.
“Ashid, go rest by the sleds.”
“Yes? But……”
“Don’t worry. I’ll call you if it gets urgent.”
“……Sorry.”
As if.  The other team’s mages were all sitting comfortably on the sleds, enjoying the ride.
“Field effect - ‘Pustulent Chill’ deactivated.”
After the blizzard subsided, we resumed our journey.
Squelch, Squelch.
The snow sunk up to our ankles with every step.
Rrrrrrrumble—
My stomach growled with hunger, but rationing was paramount.  We couldn’t afford to indulge. While we’d managed to protect the food with [Barrier] so far,  there was no telling what the future held. 
What if a blizzard hit us during a fight, and we lacked the mana to shield a crate?  That would be truly disastrous.
‘Well, things aren’t exactly peachy even now.’
Day 3 of entering Ice Rock. Everyone was weary. Even idle chatter or playful banter had vanished, replaced by the grim determination to manage our stamina and keep moving. The expedition, stripped of its leisure, was shrouded in an atmosphere of heightened tension.
‘How am I supposed to lead these guys into a war against those Noark bastards?’
There’s a saying that “morale” is key in warfare.  It was far from clear whether we could even complete the mission in this state. 
The only silver lining was the rapid XP gain.
“Frozen Spirit slain. EXP +4.”
“Corrupted Snow Sprite slain. EXP +6.”
“Frost Guardian slain. EXP +7.”
“Lich slain. EXP +6.”
“Ice Giant slain. EXP +7.”
“Frostfire Turtle slain……”
“……”
Ice Rock was teeming with high-level monsters, resulting in a remarkable rate of experience accumulation. 
Still, the path ahead was long.  Even if we managed to slay every monster in Ice Rock, it wouldn’t be enough to reach level 8.
‘It’s a tough place to get to, though, so I should farm as much as I can.’
How much longer did we fight monsters, our bodies heavy with exhaustion, as we pressed onwards?  The sun began to set, and we established camp at the edge of a cliff.  We retrieved tents from the sleds and set them up, putting sleeping bags inside. And then...
“Used Heating Stone.”
Placing a few activated magic tools inside the tent, our cozy haven was complete.
“We don’t have anyone assigned to watch over the camp tonight, so rest easy.”
Just a little heads-up, there were only two night watchmen in the entire expedition. Our turn was tomorrow, so we could finally get some proper sleep. 
Thanks to the four priests. Those guys could keep the monsters at bay with just [Divine Banishment], and it was highly unlikely any raiding party would be operating in this barren wasteland. Even if there were, no sane individual would attempt to attack a group this large.
Unless they were braindead.
“Sleep well, and see you tomorrow, old man.”
The tents, each meant for three people, were segregated by gender.  Even among us informal explorers, there was a certain line one didn’t cross. I’m also more comfortable sleeping with other guys. 
Well, it might get a little cramped for the old geezer and the mage.
“Ashid, Aldi.  You two can sleep first.”
“Are you on patrol?”
“I’m the expedition leader, after all.”
After sending the old geezer Aldi and Ashid to rest for the night, I took a quick look around the camp, checking for any potential problems.  Despite having just set up camp, I could hear snores coming from every corner.  Well, everyone was exhausted.
‘Looks like everything’s in order. I guess I’ll hit the hay too.’
With that thought, I started to head towards our team’s tent.
Squelch.
A sound caught my attention, and I turned around to see a familiar face.
“Kaislan, you weren’t asleep?”
“I had something to tell the expedition leader.”
“What is it?”
“Let’s talk while we walk.”
We started to stroll around the edge of the campsite, having a conversation.
“There’s been growing discontent among the expedition members lately.”
Discontent, huh?  It was predictable.
“Most of it is probably directed at me, right?”
Kaislan nodded grimly in response to my question.
“Humans, when they’re happy, they don’t seek reasons, but when things are hard, they’ll always find a reason.” 
A poignant observation about human nature.
“So, is that all?”
“If that was all, I wouldn’t have bothered you in the middle of the night.”
“So there’s more?”
“……There are those spreading malicious rumors within the expedition.”
“Rumors? What kind of rumors?”
“That while everyone else is rationing their supplies, our 1st team is hoarding for themselves.”
“Yeah, that’s true……”
I involuntarily sighed in front of Kaislan. I couldn’t help it. 
Ugh, this isn’t a game for kids.  
Is this the best that the royal family could muster?  
“Do you know where this started?”
“Pike Neldain.”
“One of James Cara’s team members.”
For the record, he was a warrior like me. At the banquet, he’d come up to me, smiled, and introduced himself. Such a big guy, being so sneaky.  
Ah, maybe his big size made him so hungry his brain couldn’t function properly?
“What are you going to do?”
“I don’t know……”
Kaislan offered me a few solutions.
“If you want to discipline him, it’s best done through me.”
“Because you can deflect blame?”
“I’ll make a huge scene out of it, in front of all the members.  So big he won’t even think of blaming you.”
Wow, I never thought this guy would be so loyal. It was a surprising sentiment, but I listened to his suggestion.
“Or you can use Akuraba. Supply management was her responsibility, and whatever the reason, she failed to uphold it, leading to this mess.”
It wasn’t wrong. Akuraba should have secured the supplies, regardless of whether the formation crumbled or not. But……
“She’s a renowned explorer now, so everyone’s shying away from assigning blame, but if you mention it, everyone will want to pin it on her.”
That’s what I don’t like about her.
Before I could respond, I decided to ask just one thing.
“Kaislan, what’s your reason for trying to help me, even if it means becoming a scapegoat?”
Just in case there was some ulterior motive.  Kaislan stared back at me with unwavering eyes, his reply immediate and without hesitation.
“For better or worse, you’re the one leading the expedition.”
It was an unexpected answer.
“In a situation like this, if you waver, this expedition is doomed.”
To be honest, I thought he’d be the first to try and take my place if my position was threatened.  Maybe it’s the soldier in him. Kaislan seemed to prioritize the mission above his own selfish desires.
“So, tell me, what’s your plan?”
He offered two choices, but in essence, they were the same. 
Akuraba or this guy.
He wanted me to make someone else the enemy, instead of myself.
Thanks for the advice, but I’ve already decided.
“I’m not doing anything.”
Kaislan tilted his head in confusion at the brief reply.  He asked cautiously.
“If you don’t do anything, they’ll blame you for any mistakes.”
Yeah, they will.
So what?
“I don’t care what they say.”
“……?”
“That’s why they’re the members, and I’m the leader.”
I never intended to only enjoy the privileges.
***
Day 9 of entering Ice Rock. 
The expedition, riddled with problems from the start, had finally reached its halfway point. 
We left the plains and came face to face with a massive ice mountain. We weren’t climbing it; instead, our path lay below it.
“Found the entrance!”
James Cara’s team, in charge of scouting, quickly located the passage to the next field. We followed that passage, entering a massive ice cave and descending into the depths.
Thump, Thump.
The sound of boots echoed against the hard ground. 
It wasn’t as gloomy as before, though. Isn’t that how it is in army boot camp?  You endure hardship together, and a strong bond naturally forms.
“The ice here is so clear, like glass. It’s as if we’ve entered a fantasy world.”
“Ha ha. I felt the same.”
The improved atmosphere was undoubtedly due in part to having more physical stamina. 
Half the expedition members were first-timers, so they struggled in the beginning.  Now, everyone had adapted to a certain extent. 
“Ugh, I’m starving. Now I understand why everyone hates Ice Rock.”
“I used to look at photos of my baby to keep going, but that doesn’t work here. I should’ve taken her picture out of my subspace before we landed.”
“Oh, you have a child? How old?”
Ah, it wasn’t just the atmosphere that had changed.
The creaky expedition was finally starting to move as one.
Like this:
“Monsters sighted, flank and front!”
“1st team holds the front, 2nd and 3rd teams handle the flanks!”
My instructions were followed promptly and without question.
“Frozen Webtur slain. EXP +5.”
“Unmelting Cocoon slain. EXP+6.”
“Frostfire Goblin slain. EXP +5.”
Combat was much smoother than before. Were they finally becoming true elites? As they started to work together, they were finally able to unleash their full potential.
Ah, there was another positive.
“Schwietz, you’re an absolute monster in a fight.”
As expected of the explorer community, which respects the strong, my reputation was beginning to rise as I stood at the forefront, taking on the most dangerous tasks. The rumors of me gorging on food in the middle of the night had vanished.  
As they say, actions speak louder than words.
Zzt, Zzt—
What?
A sudden noise in my ear set off my instincts.
“Erwin, what was that?”
“I don’t know. I think it came from behind……”
Behind?  
I turned around and confirmed with my own eyes.
Zzt, Zzt.
The ground was cracking like a spiderweb, unable to support the weight.
‘Damn it!’
And it was right where the trolls pulling the sled were.
“Recall! Recall the summons!”
I shouted as loud as I could. The summoner, still dazed, followed my order and recalled the trolls.
But was it too late? 
Kzzzt, Kzzzt.
The sound of cracking intensified.
“……Everyone, move!”
The explorers at the center of the crack scrambled to safety.  A few brave souls prioritized the cargo over their own well-being.
“Cargo! Secure the cargo!”
“We’re finished without this!”
“Move it!”
The explorers carefully shifted the weight, pulling the sleds as hard as they could.
But the ground collapsed faster.
Kwang Kwang Kwang—!
The ground collapsed like a sinkhole, swallowing a sled that hadn’t been moved, and two explorers struggling to push it into the unfathomable darkness.
And then.
“Riard Ashid has cast the 5th-grade auxiliary magic, ‘Float’.”
Two explorers floated upwards as if by a miracle. As the expressions on their faces shifted from despair to relief, a sound came from below.
Splash—!
Huh, there was water flowing beneath us?  We’ll never be able to retrieve the sled now.
My heart sank, but I quickly issued orders.
“Everyone, move as far away from the cliff as possible! Don’t bunch up, just in case!”
The explorers, finally shaking off their shock, obeyed my commands. I cautiously approached the edge and looked down.  I used the mage’s light to illuminate the area, and as expected, there was water flowing below, making it impossible to even locate the sled.
“Akuraba!!”
“Yes! Yes!”
“What was the ratio of food on that sled?”
“Um, about half!”
Ugh, our already dwindling supplies had just taken another hit.
“……”
Akuraba started to watch me nervously.
“Um……”
“Quiet. I’m thinking.”
“……”
I couldn’t make sense of it.
‘First the ground collapsed, and now it’s happening again?  This is insane.’
No matter how I thought about it, it didn’t add up.
Which meant…….
“Akuraba.”
“Yes. What is it?”
“Go ask everyone right now.”
We needed to confirm the obvious.
“Is there anyone who changed their name? Was it Hans?”
This should give us a clearer picture.  Was this a series of unfortunate coincidences? Or was it something else?
“Confirm as quickly as possible. This is important.”
Was this a man-made disaster, the result of someone’s malicious intent?
