## Betrayer (1)
“Why are you here?”
The words were expressed only through his eyes. I considered that he might have talent in acting, but at the same time, I understood his feelings.  After all, I had been involuntarily held by the king for days, never even showing my face outside.  It must have been an unexpected sight. 
Well, the information about my appearance in District 5 before coming here could have been leaked…  But if so, wouldn’t they have been even more surprised? They would have wondered why I was in District 9 instead of where I should be, in District 5.
“Ah, long time no see.”
A chuckle escaped my lips.  He seemed to snap out of his daze, his stiff facial muscles barely moving as he replied.
“…Fissit. I’ve been receiving quite a lot of support lately, you see.”
He answered as calmly as ever, but I could clearly tell he was not as relaxed as he seemed.  After all, once summoned creatures reach a certain level, they react and behave according to their summoner’s will, without needing explicit orders.
And…….
“Fissit… ”
Before he could finish his awkward laugh, the chimera he was riding began to back away, retracting its front leg that had been aggressively reaching out.
“Where are you going?”
I asked, crushing a swarm of nearby Corpse Soldiers with a single swing of my hammer.  He stuttered as he responded.
“I, I thought… It would be cowardly to ambush you at night, you see… Fissit… I, I’ll see you again later!”
Did he even know what he was saying?  I didn’t know, but the instinct of a warrior who never missed an opportunity had been triggered. 
The Necromancer, who should have been in the rear, appeared at the front line.  Honestly, I don’t know why. Maybe he just wanted to show off…  Anyway, that’s not important.
Thump—thump—thump—
If I could crack this guy’s skull right here…
‘Well, it wouldn’t be bad, would it?’
No, I’ll correct myself.  It’s not just not bad, it’s the best possible scenario.  After all, he’s on my kill list as well.
“Where do you think you’re going? Come here for a minute.”
I gestured with my outstretched hammer, but the chimera turned its back and ran away.
“No, just for a minute, come here. I just wanted to talk—.”
Despite my repeated attempts to persuade him, the four-legged chimera only sped up, running in the opposite direction.
“I, I’m busy, so I’ll be—!”
Look, I just wanted to have a word.  This guy’s really got sharp eyes.
“Behel—laaaaaaaaaaa!”
I then enlarged his body using [Gigantification] and rushed forward.  I knew that since I’d gone outside the gate, there wouldn’t be anyone to stop the Corpse Legion…
‘They’ll figure it out.  This should buy them enough time to prepare.’
Moreover, it wasn’t a complete waste.  I’d used [Gigantification] to increase my stride, but there was an unexpected effect.
Whoomp! Whoomp!
Just running with heavy footsteps was enough to crush and explode the Corpse Soldiers modified for battle. 
Just like this.
Crack!
Of course, the distance wasn’t closing easily despite this.  It would have been a great help if I had a movement skill like [Leap], but unfortunately, my Shield Barbarian doesn’t have that ability.
Whoomp! Whoomp!
So, I followed him stubbornly, dragging my massive body along, and he tried every trick in the book to shake me off.
“Avet Necrapeto has cast [Corpse Explosion].”
He detonated modified Corpse Soldiers to spew out venom.
“Avet Necrapeto has cast [Stone Curse].”
He used CC skills.
He tried to block me with a huge Corpse Monster.  He even tried to obscure my vision with strange smoke. 
He tried everything he could, but it was impossible to stop a Shield Barbarian who was almost 70% complete in terms of combat skills.
“Ugh…! This is cheating!”
In a way, this kind of praise was also expected.  A tank that couldn’t be stopped by any means was nothing short of a disaster for a ranged class.
“Just give up and stop! I will try to resolve this through dialogue if you stop now! I swear on the honor of a warrior—.”
“Don’t lie! You’re just trying to have a physical conversation!”
Whew, how did he know?
Whoomp! Whoomp!
In the end, I gave up on persuasion through dialogue and continued to walk silently.  Honestly, there was no rush.  I just had to keep running, and the distance would gradually close.  It seemed that he, like me, lacked proper movement skills…
‘This is kind of funny.’
He was a lot more impressive back in the day.  Now he just turns his back and runs away at the sight of my face.  A lot of time has passed since then.
Whoomp! Whoomp!
Anyway, as the conversation ceased and the distance gradually closed, he began to complain.
“Ugh! Bjorn Yandel…! Why are you here in the first place!”
“…Huh?”
What’s he talking about now? It doesn’t sound like he’s just saying this out of shock.
“Get a move on, everyone! Will you just let that monster rampage?”
He yelled, as if talking to his comrades.  However, no support magic flew in, nor did anyone appear like a hero to save him.  His voice, filled with resentment, grew louder.
“Are you going to keep ignoring me? This is all your fault! You guys are the ones who said we should distract them by going after District 9 while Bjorn Yandel was in District 5!”
Oh, so that’s how it is?  I’ve stumbled into something big by accident, but ultimately, my appearance in District 5 disrupted their plan—
“Oppa, why is that our fault? If you want to blame someone, blame the Guild Master or Vice Guild Master oppa.”
A voice came from above.  I looked up and saw a familiar face riding a single broom at a low altitude. 
Lilianne Vivienne, the Screaming Witch.
“And we told you from the beginning to stay behind and not go crazy.  But I remember you being the one who insisted on taking the lead!”
“Is that important right now?! Why did you show up now? Any magic will do, just stop that guy—.”
“Ugh… I don’t want to.”
The Screaming Witch refused with a disgusted expression.
“…What?”
“Don’t you remember? How am I supposed to stop a monster that reflects every spell I cast?”
It sounded like she was talking about the ‘Essence of Gachabon’ that had already disappeared, but it didn’t really matter.  I had a much better defense skill now.
“Character has cast [Greedy Scales].”
Therefore, I activated Dragon Mode in advance as a precaution.  Of course, this skill doesn’t have a ‘reflection’ mechanism…
It doesn’t really matter, though.  I now have a new passive skill called [Aegis Dragon Scale] that allows me to stack up a value proportional to the amount of damage I receive and explode it all at once.
‘Tough luck.’
I might as well just let them hit me and help me stack the gauge.  Of course, it would be terrifying for the enemies facing me.  But what’s it to them?  This is the truth—
“So, let’s join hands, oppa.”
Huh?
“Join hands?”
“It’s going to be a bit of a squeeze if we’re both on it, but… We can’t be picky at this point, can we?”
As a Barbarian, I was about to go completely crazy.
‘Damn it.’
Orculis elites running away from the very start?  If this continues, I’ll end up like a dog chasing chickens, just staring at the roof.  Therefore…
‘Ah, right, I have that.’
I threw the hand axe I had pulled from my spatial inventory as hard as I could.  It didn’t come to mind immediately because I rarely used it in battle, but thanks to my constant practice, the axe flew powerfully toward my target.
“Ack!”
Vivienne, who had been about to grab hands, quickly changed direction and barely dodged the axe.  Then…
“Hurry!”
Vivienne stretched out her hand again and approached at the urging of the Corpse Collector.  I threw the axe again, and this time, they were prepared for it.  They immediately activated a shield.
Ah, it didn’t really matter, though.  Even though it was a simple axe throw without the help of any skill…
Whoooosh!
My abnormally developed strength makes my skills indistinguishable from my natural abilities.
Crackle!
As expected, the shield shattered instantly upon impact.
“Ack!”
Vivienne, hit on the temple by the handle of the flying axe that had shattered the shield, screamed and fell from the broom, rolling on the ground.  And…
“Damn it!”
He cursed, but instead of going back to help his fallen comrade who had tried to save him, the Corpse Collector continued forward.
“Hey, where are you going?!”
“…I, I can’t help it! You can replace a mage, but you can’t replace me!”
“Cut the crap and come back! Come back and give me a ride, you bastard!”
“You gotta look out for yourself… Fissit…!”
Even I, who was chasing after him, was speechless at such a cowardly line.
“Hey! You goddamn bastard!”
Vivienne finally screamed in anger, but the Corpse Collector didn’t turn the chimera’s head back.
***
Should I keep chasing after the Corpse Collector?  Or should I finish off this one?  I hesitated for a moment, but eventually I stopped in front of Vivienne, who was lying on the ground with a broken ankle.
“I can’t believe this.”
I felt my legs go weak from seeing such a shocking scene.
“…I surrender.”
What are you talking about?  This isn’t a surrender, it’s a defeat.
Thump.
Vivienne, seeing me approach without a word, started grinding her teeth, making a rattling sound.  Surprisingly, it wasn’t me she was glaring at.
“…Oppa, can you just let me go? I’ll make sure to kill that bastard… Okay?”
Her gaze was filled with 100% sincerity.  I thought it might be beneficial for me to just let her go, but…
“Nope, no can do.”
I firmly refused, raising my hammer.
“No, really…! I, I can do anything you want… Okay?”
Vivienne tried to use her appearance and gender as weapons, but she was sadly wrong.  After all, I’m a K-Barbarian who was born and raised in Korea, and I know what true gender equality means.  If I put away my hammer right now, won’t the men who died for me feel wronged?
Slide.
Men and women are equal.  The evidence is that when hit with a hammer, both men and women’s heads crack open the same—
“Comrades!!  You’re trying to get to your comrades, right?!”
Huh?
Vivienne, who had been tightly closed, slowly opened her eyes and looked at me.
“…Oh, no?”
She’s trying to probe me even in this situation.
“If you have something to say, say it now.  I don’t have time.”
“I, I can take you to your comrades! I, I can do it safely and comfortably!”
Hmm…
“I can help you in many ways, too!  M, mage, you don’t need one, do you?”
I already have one.
“Especially if you’re going to catch that goddamn bastard, I can even give my soul to you—!”
How am I supposed to deal with this?  If I just crack her head open now and chase after the Corpse Collector, I might be able to catch up… 
‘Let’s think about it for another 10 seconds.’
Just as I was pondering that, a word came out of Vivienne’s mouth.
“…Betrayer!”
I tilted my head in confusion.
“…Huh?”
“I can also tell you who the traitor is among your comrades!”
…Well, I guess I should hear what she has to say.
