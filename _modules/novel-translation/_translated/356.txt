## Chapter 356: Isolation (3)
The first-stage effect of the [Evolved Carapace] grants 50% resistance to sword-type attacks. The second stage reduces piercing damage by half. So, what would happen if this effect were to increase by 1.5 times? The answer is quite simple.
75% resistance to sword-type attacks. And a 75% reduction in piercing damage. It's worth noting that when combined with the sword resistance, this effectively renders you immune to piercing damage from swords, even in your base state. 
However, there is one drawback...
"If only it weren't for the limit, I could have gotten a sword-immune judgment."
The limit for sword resistance is around 85%. Therefore, even with the passive enhancement of [Transcendence], I can't achieve full immunity.  
To summarize the final results:
"Immune to stabs." 
Slashing attacks might still work, but the Ogre's passive skill [Iron Hide] would stand firm against those.  
And...
"With [Iron Hide] combined with my current physical resistance..."
Well, at this point, it wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that I've become a nightmare for all knights. 
Perhaps because he didn't know about these details, was he worried?
Thud.
The moment the Blood Knight's foot slammed into the ground, someone exclaimed:
“He’s going to hit you!”
It was Raven’s voice. 
It’s quicker to show than to explain, right?
Swish. 
Just as I thought that, I blocked the Blood Knight's thrust with my shield.
Clack!
It had been a while since I heard that sound from the tip of a sword.
“!”
The Blood Knight’s face contorted in surprise as he witnessed his aura being blocked by my shield.
“How…?”
How, you ask? 
[Unification], the enchantment I obtained through the 6th stage of the Undead mark, implies that my equipment becomes one with me. This means that it also applies to my equipment when I use [Gigantification]. 
The same applies to the [Evolved Carapace]…
"Ah, I wonder if he wasn’t curious about this?"
I doubt the Blood Knight would have been questioning such detailed aspects. He was probably just wondering this.
How did I block the aura?
There’s a long story behind it, but…
In this world of survival of the fittest, it can be explained in just one sentence.
“I.”
I pushed the Blood Knight’s sword away with my shield and said,
“Am stronger than you.”
What else needs to be said?
In this world where only victors and losers exist.
Whoosh!
I swung my hammer with all my might, determined to engrave that truth into his mind.
Thud.
As expected, the Blood Knight nimbly dodged backward.
I wasn't disappointed.
Catching a fleeing enemy is easier than catching a falling star.
“The character has activated [Eye of the Storm].”
“Due to the powers of Transcendence, the abilities inherent in this skill are unlocked.”
A combination of [Transcendence] and [Eye of the Storm].
Wooooooosh!
A sudden gust of wind caught the Blood Knight’s hair as he was retreating, pulling him towards me. Or, to be more precise, towards where my hammer was about to strike.
But unfortunately...
Clack!
Right before the hammer could connect, the Blood Knight’s body blurred into a mist, swiftly shifting through the air to avoid it.
"Right, you're not just aura-wielding, are you?"
I readjusted my grip on the hammer as I thought that, and Raven, unable to shake her old habit, quickly yelled:
“…Bloodline Entry! It’s a 4th-grade ability that temporarily accelerates the body, allowing for aerial movement!”
I appreciate the sentiment, but I already knew that.
Besides, you mentioned it far too briefly.
It's not just simple acceleration; it’s a boost to agility.
And...
"You also left out that it decreases Strength, and because of the phantom-body judgment, physical damage won't hit him."
I licked my lips as I watched the crimson mist, moving like a fly through the air.
I got the Demon Crusher as well, so I thought I'd get to enjoy some good action this time around.
"As long as he has that, it's better to leave the damage dealing to the others."
It's a shame I can't handle it myself, but I don't plan to be stubborn.
Isn’t teamwork the essence of being a tank?
“Erwen Fornachi di Tercia has activated [Elemental Synthesis].”
Fire, water, wind, earth.
And darkness, Erwen's main attribute after signing a contract with the Spirit King.
An arrow made of all five elements flew out, pursuing the crimson mist.
However...
“Aura is truly overpowered.”
The Blood Knight’s swing shattered all the arrows.
But did the Blood Knight consider the arrows a threat?
Fwhoosh!
The Blood Knight, who had been preoccupied with fleeing, turned around and swooped towards Erwen. He figured he should take care of the ranged attacker first…
But will that work?
To the tank’s disappointment.
“Erwen, behind me.”
The moment the Blood Knight swooped in, Erwen disappeared behind me.
That's why tanks are so important in dungeons.
They act as a wall, a safe haven for the DPS, no matter when or where they are.
Whoosh!
Even though Erwen vanished behind me, the Blood Knight still swung his sword.
It wasn't a pointless attempt.
He probably thought the aura being blocked was due to the shield, so this time, instead of aiming for the shield, he went for the seam of my armor, targeting the joints where my skin was exposed.
Ah, of course, the outcome didn’t differ much.
Whack!
A slash instead of a stab.
While it wasn’t a complete immunity, [Iron Hide] activated, leaving only a slight cut on my skin.
In other words, I withstood the aura bare-handed.
“!”
The Blood Knight’s eyes widened in astonishment at this rare sight.
Surprised again, aren’t you?
Didn't you believe me when I said I was stronger than you?
“Sheter Evon!”
Raven's curse magic struck the Blood Knight as he momentarily paused to attack me.
I didn't need to think about what kind of magic it was; I’ve encountered it countless times during exploration.
[Materialization].
An 8th-grade curse magic that forces physical immunity to be lifted when it hits a phantom-type monster.
Yes, this is what teamwork is about.
When I was in Noirk, there were no mages, so there were many frustrating things.
Wooooosh!
The moment the Blood Knight’s body, previously hazy like mist, became clear, I swung my hammer down.
However, he dodged it again. 
I’m sure I can knock him out with just one hit.
“I’ll help.”
Soon Amelia joined the battle.
By the way, she was still busy dealing with all the corpses swarming from all sides, using the clone she summoned earlier…
“…Who are you?”
The Blood Knight asked, looking at us. 
He was unable to counter our relentless attacks, but he was curious about this.
I wasn’t obliged to answer.
“Regarding those like—”
“Woooooooooosh—!”
Instead of calling upon the name of my ancestors, whom I can no longer summon, I roared with all my might, swinging my hammer repeatedly. This forced the Blood Knight to focus solely on dodging.
And…
“…”
The Blood Knight continued to fight back, unleashing various skills, but he was quickly overwhelmed.
It was an expected outcome.
After all, [Dungeon and Stone] is a team game, and even individually, our current team lacks nothing.
Take Erwen, for instance.
“Erwen, back!”
I kept hiding her behind me whenever she became the target, but that doesn’t mean she’s weaker than the Blood Knight.
Her innate agility and various utility abilities using spirits allow her to keep her distance.
Even if she were to fight him one-on-one, she wouldn’t be defeated.
The same applies to Amelia.
“Amelia Rainwells has activated [Abyssal Power].”
The Blood Knight’s aura can be blocked by an identical aura, and her physical specs aren’t lacking either.
Well, Raven’s situation is a bit different…
“Argen Hail Toon… Kyaak!”
She’s out of the question.
It’s impossible for a mage to go one-on-one against a knight.
“Even if you’re scared, stay close behind me. He seems to be specifically targeting you.”
“Ah, okay.”
Erwen and Amelia are skilled enough to defend themselves, so I focused on protecting Raven, continuing the battle.
How long had it been?
“…But why isn’t he running away even in this condition?”
I began to feel a sense of unease.
He should know that he’s going to lose if things continue like this, so why isn’t he fleeing?
“Is he waiting for my MP to run out?”
If that's the case, it wouldn’t be bad.
[Ironclad Fortress] depletes MP every second, but I didn’t activate [Gigantification] on purpose.
It'll be quicker to finish the battle than it would be for my MP to run out.
“What about the multi-teleportation magic?”
Something felt off, so I checked our last resort.
“It’ll take about 5 more minutes to start again from now.”
“Start again…?”
“Actually… I stopped chanting earlier…."
So, you assumed it wouldn't be needed because we were overpowering him?
“Prepare it now anyway. You never know what might happen."
“…Okay.”
Just as I was giving my orders again,
“Shwiitz, magic!”
Amelia suddenly exclaimed, her voice urgent.
And at the same time,
“Rilanne Vivianne has activated the 3rd-grade black magic [Falling Star].”
A massive sphere of dark light fell from the sky, piercing the mist before plunging down.
“Damn it.”
Right, he was waiting for his comrade.
***
The moment the magic activated and I sensed that I couldn’t dodge, my body froze solid.
Because I haven’t finished setting up my defenses against magic.
My aura setup is almost complete, but it’s causing my magic resistance to be lower than it was before.
But amidst all this…
“He’s slow to react.”
Raven, who was in the middle of chanting the multi-teleportation magic, seemed unable to stop it.
However…
“What can I do? I’ll have to take it head-on.”
In the blink of an eye, I made my decision.
The magic is aimed at me.
Erwen and Amelia are a bit far from me.
However, if I dodge, Raven, who is right behind me, will be in danger.
Therefore, there is only one choice I can make.
“…Ugh!”
I embraced Raven's small body, then fell to the ground, shielding her.
And then…
"Gigantification."
I immediately grew my body, using [Transcendence] as well.
“Oh, Mister…!”
“Shwiitz!!”
The magic plunged down, striking my back.
KWAANG—!
It began with a shock that felt like my spine would shatter.
Then, the reverberations of my internal organs, along with my bones and muscles, sent shivers of pain throughout my body.
Damn, I wonder if it’s because of the absence of the Corpse Golem?
Why am I hurting this much?
“U…?”
I involuntarily grimaced at the unbearable pain when I heard a voice from below.
“How… even [Gigantification]……?”
Damn, is it over now?
I had saved [Gigantification] for just such an occasion.
Unlike [Swing], which had almost no effect, this one was noticeable the moment you activated it.
“You, by any chance…….”
Right, I don’t have time for this right now.
“We can talk later.”
The moment the shockwaves that ran through my back subsided, I quickly stood up.
Clack.
Something fell off my back.
It was a fragment of my shattered armor.
And…
“Ugh, I’m dizzy.”
My vision blurred.
It wasn't fog, it was smoke.
Smoke that came from my body.
Fwhoosh!
Damn, when was the last time I got this messed up?
Every joint in my body screamed in pain as I attempted to stand straight.
Damn, I’m just getting more and more dramatic.
“It’s been a while since I’ve been all bark and no bite.”
I forced myself to think happy thoughts and stood up completely, then set Raven down, who was in my arms.
And I sent her behind me.
But did she finally realize what I looked like?
“You… y-your back…!”
It’s my back. You have to finish what you were saying.
As I thought that, Amelia stood beside me and checked my condition for me.
“It’s best to not listen to the details."
“…Really that bad?”
“Yes, it’s a wonder you’re even standing.”
Ah, uh, well…
If that’s the case…
“…Never mind. Just give me some potions.”
“Potions… I already used them.”
Huh? I don’t feel anything at all.
Ah, maybe I’m numb on my back?
“Oh, now that I think about it, I don’t feel any pain since earlier…."
I comforted myself by thinking it was a positive thing, then looked forward.
The first thing I saw was the Blood Knight, standing at a distance from us. 
He was a wreck from being pummeled 4:1.
Well, based on what I’ve heard, he seemed to be in better condition than me. 
But anyway, that’s not what’s important.
“Grandpa, why are you pushing yourself so hard? I was so scared when I heard from Necrapeto Oppa!”
Next to the Blood Knight stood a woman wearing a robe.
She had a staff, so she must be a mage…
Did she cast the spell just now?
“Ah! Hello! I don’t know how you survived that, but I’m glad to see you!”
As if sensing my gaze, the woman waved at me with a bright smile.
Erwen shivered at this.
“Erwen, I’m fine, don’t fall for her taunts.”
Even as she said that, I was worried, so I grabbed her wrist and pulled her beside me, then asked Amelia.
“Amelia, who is that woman?”
“The Screaming Witch, Rilanne Vivianne.”
Ah, so it’s her.
It’s my first time seeing her.
“And who is the man next to her?”
I shifted my gaze towards the woman, and Amelia answered promptly.
“The Lighthouse Keeper. His name is unknown.”
Ha, this guy is famous too.
I heard he was one of the few support-type ability users in Orculls.
“And the one next to him…."
“That’s enough, I know who he is.”
I interrupted Amelia and shifted my gaze.
The moment our eyes met, the man’s eyes, hidden by the mask, curled into a long, wicked grin.
“Well now, I think the numbers are finally even, don’t you, Fake?”
The Corpse Collector, Abet Necrapeto.
Ugh, this guy is everywhere.
