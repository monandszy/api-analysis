## Chapter 569: The Closed Gate (3)
The private conversation with the village chief continued for some time afterward. I relentlessly pressed him, asking what I didn't know about this layer, and what I needed to do to open the portal stele. Yet, he evaded my inquiries with ambiguous answers.
"You'll naturally learn in due time. And why worry so much? You'll eventually leave this place and return to the city."
"Why won't you just tell me? Is it because—?"
"It's not because I harbor any ill intentions. I merely considered what might be beneficial to you."
"What does that mean?"
"What if there's more to this layer that even I haven't discovered? If I offer advice, it might prevent you from finding those things. After all, you'll end up acting solely based on my guidance."
Was this some kind of 'lion dropping its cub over the cliff' scenario? If so, it made even less sense. 
We were not bound by a close parent-child relationship. I couldn't trust his intentions to 'help' me. But…
"Hmph, don't look at it that way."
Observing me, the village chief chuckled and continued with a characteristic smile. 
"Given the circumstances, you and I are in this together, aren't we?  You must have also considered the ways I could benefit you in the future, haven't you?"
"Well… I've thought about it a little."
"So have I. As my helper grows, my capabilities will expand as well."
Just sweet-talking.
"So you'll tell me after more consideration. I'm not leaving anytime soon anyway, am I?"
Hearing his words, like he was placating a sulking child, I merely nodded.  No matter what he said, I couldn't easily understand, but it seemed like  persisting wouldn't change anything. It was better to discuss something productive in that time.
"So, what's the plan now?" 
This was the question I asked for the umpteenth time today. However, the context was different this time.  My previous questions focused on the village chief himself and us, while this one encompassed the entire expedition force.
"Are we staying on this island?"
How would our future exploration be conducted?
To this question, the village chief answered directly.
"We'll likely stay until tonight. We haven't officially discovered a dimensional stele yet, have we? We need to find it first and give the mages time to study it."
"That's what Jerome Saintred would've done?"
"That's right."
"Anyway, so what's next?"
"It's still undecided. But I'll have an answer by tomorrow."
"….Alright."
And so, our conversation for the day concluded. 
After the private meeting, I returned to my comrades, but as I was passing some time, I received an order from the deputy commander. They planned to search the entire village once more, and each squad was to move freely and find anything suspicious.
"This is essentially a rest order. Let's find a decent spot to rest."
Our temporary squad 4, under my command, entered a vacant house and started chatting. 
But maybe the laid-back approach wasn't a good idea.
"We'll go take a look around. It feels a bit strange to just stay put…."
"Are you worried about the commander?"
"More than that, there might be something hidden that we've missed."
Mühl Armin said so, leading the expedition force members to search, and the same applied to Wight Hecks, the clan leader of the Hecks clan. 
“…If we find anything, maybe it’ll be recognized as a merit." 
While Armin's side aimed for 'exploration' itself, these guys seemed more interested in the 'reward'. 
Whatever the case, it wasn't my concern.
Eventually, word would spread that the cave with the dimensional stele had been found, and I'd just casually show up and react a few times around then. 
'But for some reason, it's just us left again.'
The Hecks clan and Armin's expedition force had left, leaving only the Clan Anabada members to chat.
"Ugh! Don't, don't look!"
As I casually glanced around, I met Erwen's eyes, and she jumped, covering her face.
Tsk, she's still doing this.
While I sighed inwardly, watching Erwen scurry to a corner, Bersil approached me. 
"Don't worry. There's a potion that makes hair grow quickly. I'll make it for you right away when we go back to the city."
"Oh, you have something like that? That's good."
"Wow… your taste is really strong."
“…Huh?”
Why was she suddenly talking about my taste?
As I displayed a bewildered expression, Bersil avoided my gaze.
"W-well, I think Tersia looks really good with short hair, too…."
I felt the same way.
But she always does this whenever our eyes meet.
Even if I said something now, it would probably sound like a consolation. So, I chose not to. 
'We’ll still be here for a long time….'
While I was worried about the future, there was no immediate solution, so I cleared my mind.
Just as I was about to relax, a man entered the house where we were slacking off. 
"You're here. I've been looking everywhere."
"Kaislan? What brings you here?"
"I was talking to Armin's expedition force when I heard you were resting here, so I came to see how you were doing."
"Good to see you. You should take a break, too. Don't just work yourself to death."
"I was planning to. After this expedition, I'm done with this dreary military life."
Perhaps due to the Ice Rock incident and the intense resentment towards the royal family? He was going to slack off?  That's something the Kaislan from before would never have done.
Whatever the case, it wasn't my concern.
But unexpectedly, the visitor wasn't just Kaislan.
"Is… anyone… here?"
Soon after, another person cautiously entered the building.
"Sven Parav? What brings you here?"
"I ran into the Hecks clan… Would you mind talking for a bit? Just the two of us."
"Of course."
At the goblin's request, I left the building alone and talked to him in a nearby vacant house. 
He seemed to have a lot of questions for me.
"S-so… what happened?"
A broad question without a subject.
Well, from his perspective, it's pretty confusing. Our guys at least heard some explanations, but he didn't. 
I summarized the situation briefly.
"It's hard to explain in detail, but it ended well."
"Huh?"
"It means we successfully avoided the scene from your prophecy."
"Ah… that's a relief… but…."
Although he clearly wanted to know more about what I had omitted, he swallowed his questions.
That's how well-mannered he is.
I patted his shoulder in encouragement.
"Sven Parav. I should have said this before, but thank you."
"Huh?"
"I can't go into details, but if it weren't for you, who knows what might have happened?"
"Ah…."
"I'll need your help in the future. If anything happens, tell me right away. I'll do everything I can to help."
Was my expression of gratitude that unexpected? He stared blankly for a moment. Then, as if he had snapped out of it, he said modestly that it was nothing and left.
He'd probably get scolded if he stayed out for too long?
"You've been through a lot, too. Alright then. See you later."
I finished our conversation and went back inside.  Ainar ran towards me, shouting. 
"Bjorn!!"
Hmm, that tone suggests she has something to show off.
I quickly scanned the area and immediately noticed something different.
I wasn't sure how…
"Raven?"
Raven was there. And…
"Forget Aru! Over there! Look at that!"
Erwen was wearing a dark, iron helmet.
“…What is that?”
Raven, not Ainar, asked me, and Raven sighed and explained.
"Tersia seemed a little down, so Pnellin came up with a plan."
Yeah, looking at his proud smile, that's probably what happened. 
"Ha! Genius idea! If she wears this, she can hide that embarrassing short hair. And that's not all! She can even protect her hair while wearing this!"
Ainar boasted proudly, presenting his barbarian solution.
"That’s enough. If you saw it, go and try to persuade her."
Raven quietly whispered, urging Ainar to stop.
But I hesitated to answer, and first made eye contact with Erwen.
"Th-that man… what, what do you think…?"
Surprisingly, Erwen, wearing the iron helmet, no longer avoided my gaze.  I was worried that her hair would distract her during battles and hinder her movements, but that worry had been solved with a single helmet.
“…Not bad.”
Of course, it looked a little unbalanced, putting an iron helmet on top of that delicate outfit that combined practicality and fashion as an explorer.
But whatever.
"You’ve been thinking a lot, Ainar."
"Hmph, it wasn't easy. But Erwen is my friend!"
The problem was solved.
***
"Are you really letting Tersia go around like that? She'll definitely be a laughingstock! Hey, Raines? Say something—."
"Leave her be. If she’s okay with it, what can we do?"
"Tersia! Are you really okay with this?"
"Huh? Yeah… I think it does make me feel less embarrassed when I wear this."
With Raven’s mouth wide open in disbelief, the topic ended.
Erwen would continue wearing that iron helmet.
"Oh my god… how did this place become like this?"
What are you talking about, girl?
"Enough, Raven. What brings you here?"
"Ah, that? I just wanted to see what Yande was up to."
"Huh?"
"It was a free search order, right? I thought Yande might find something…."
Oh, in other words, you came to mooch off me.
If you’re around when someone finds something, you get to research it first.
"Too bad for you. As you can see, we're just resting."
"….Right. I didn’t expect this."
I was talking with Raven for a while when Amelia chimed in.
"By the way, Yande, are you done talking?"
"I’m done, and Sven Parav left."
"I see… Then can you spare me some time?"
It seems like everyone wants to talk to me today. 
"Excuse me for a bit. It might take a while, so Raven, go play around and come back on your own."
"Do I look that free? Alright. I was going to leave right now anyway."
"Really? Okay then. Take care."
I sent Raven off, and then went outside with Amelia.
I was genuinely curious.
What could she possibly want to talk about?
The answer came right away.
"I wanted to just ignore it, but seeing him sulking in the corner… I just couldn’t stand it.”
Ah…
I knew this was coming.
"What happened with Misha Kalstain yesterday?"
Honestly, there was no reason to hide it.
Things like Baekho, the Resurrection Stone, the two and a half year gap, and the rift of mistrust that arose from it…
But somehow, I couldn’t bring myself to say it.
So, I simply answered.
"Nothing happened."
A lie that even a three-year-old wouldn't believe.
However, Amelia simply nodded quietly upon hearing those words.
"Right. I see."
"...."
"Tell me if you want to talk about it later. I’ll be waiting."
What’s with this condescending tone, as if talking to a child?
I chuckled and replied.
"Okay."
Somehow, I felt a little better.
***
The time we spent on the village chief's island turned out to be longer than anticipated.
The reason was simple.
We were originally planning to head to our next destination the day after we found the dimensional stele, but…
"The flow of magic emanating from the dimensional stele is similar to the pattern of the two-way teleportation device recently published in a journal!"
"If this is true… then it might be possible to force the stele to activate!"
The mages studying the dimensional stele seemed to have discovered something unusual. They bombarded us with incomprehensible words and begged to stay on the island.
And…
"I’ll give you ten days. Make sure you succeed within that time."
The village chief granted their request.
He had no choice, really.  Jerome Saintred would have made the same decision. 
Of course, he might have had some expectations as well. 
If the mages could actually succeed in activating the stele, they could return to the city immediately.
'From the start, the village chief wasn't interested in exploring….'
He had planned to just 'adapt' and return, so staying in the village or exploring beyond it didn't really matter to him.
One day, two days, three days…
Time flowed relentlessly.
The mages spent their days experimenting in front of the dimensional stele, while the rest of us either rested in the village or climbed the island to kill monsters and pass the time.
And how many more days did this continue?
"The character's soul resonates and is drawn to a specific world."
The day the community opened arrived.
A connection to the outside world, and the only place where I could meet this jerk Baekho.
'Finally, I can confront him.'
I was looking forward to it, so as soon as I woke up in the room, I turned on my computer and moved the mouse.
Click, click.
But what was this?
As soon as I opened the community, a pop-up window appeared, covering more than half of the screen.
[Notice to all players using Ghostbusters.]
“…A notice?”
I don't think they've ever posted a notice like this before.
Did something happen outside?
I hurriedly read through the rest of the content and froze like a statue.
[Hello, this is the GM.]
The notice, starting with a common phrase like that, contained information about when this community started, its intended purpose, and how much effort the management team poured into maintaining it.
Any gamer who had played a minor game would have felt a sense of foreboding from the content.
This type of notice always ends the same way.
'Damn it.'
Even though I hoped it wasn't true.
There was no need to read further.
[We deeply appreciate everyone who has used Ghostbusters until now, and we apologize for having to deliver this notice.]
[Due to the management team’s personal circumstances, Ghostbusters service will be terminated as of today.]
[GP purchased with cash can be refunded through the newly created refund inquiry tab….]
The server had gone down.
