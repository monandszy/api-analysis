##  Dilemma (2)
Crunch, crunch.
I continued walking, slowly chewing on jerky. This special high-calorie jerky for exploration was supplied this morning. If anyone asks why I'm eating breakfast now, the answer is simple. It was the last supply. 
Crunch, crunch.
As of today, all our food reserves have been depleted.  In other words, there's no more food until we reach the 8th floor.  But, is it just me, or… 
Crunch, crunch.
Is this jerky somehow even more delicious today? 
‘What the hell, why is it gone already?’
My moment of jerky-induced bliss was shattered by the sudden realization that my hand was empty.  A wave of anger washed over me.
"Already… all gone?" 
Really? This is the last meal? And I'm still starving after this?  No, even if the calorie needs of each person differ, why would the supplies be the same for everyone?
Grrrrrr-
This is a clear case of reverse discrimination.  Isn't it?
Don't wizards and priests like them have lower basal metabolic rates?  And they can just wave their staffs around from the back, meaning much less physical exertion.  
Yet they still get one jerky each? This is an insult and an abomination to those warriors fighting on the frontlines, shedding blood and sweat. If the leader had even a semblance of sanity, this policy would never—
‘Ah, I am the leader.’
Well, what can I do?  Truth be told, I didn't want to do this. But it's obvious that if I give warriors special treatment, they'll accuse me of self-interest, right? 
So, I took the initiative and implemented this policy.  
‘Well, it seems like it failed.’
This policy earned me the "neither grateful nor resentful" attitude of other job classes, and the hatred of the warriors.  How do I know the warriors hate me? Well, the source is me, myself. I'm doing it right now, am I not?
"Heeheehee." 
"Sir, why are you laughing?"
"Warriors laugh when they're in pain."
"Is… that laughing?"
Erwen, who had briefly left the formation, approached me at a brisk pace, a disgusted expression on her face. She then flashed me a smile and held something out.
"Jer… jerky…?"
"Yes!"
"You're… giving this to me…?"
"Yes!"
I questioned her in disbelief, but she nodded without changing her expression. I took the jerky, my mind still in a daze.
"St, stop it! I'm not hungry at all. You eat it."
"If you're going to say that, at least lower your smile."
Wait, my smile?
I was confused, but Erwen summoned a water spirit, turning it into a mirror. In it, I saw myself, smiling like a fool.
"See? You're really laughing! Heehee."
"……"
"Just eat it, quickly. I'm fine. Other people are sharing their rations too, you know? Even those who are struggling."
"What?"
What's she talking about?
As I tilted my head in confusion, Amelia, who had been following behind, provided the answer. 
"The rearguard, those who have spare stamina, have been saving some food, just in case."
"Saving? How? It would have gone bad."
"This is about after we entered the cave. There wasn't any ice storm anymore."
"Ah, right, that's right."
Was I so famished that I couldn't even remember something so simple?
Anyway, that's not important…
"But is that really true? Sharing their already limited rations."
"If you don't believe it, you can see for yourself later."
Hmm, I need to see it now.
"Halt!"
I used my authority as the expedition leader to stop our advance.  It's about time for a break anyway.
"Oh, a break!"
"I'm finally going to live!"
"Haa, aa, aa! Supply officer! Blanket! Get me a blanket! I need to close my eyes for a moment, even if just for a little while!"
The priest activated "Decree of Annihilation," transforming the surroundings into a safe zone. The team members, without a second thought, lay down on the ground and started to regain their stamina.
And…
Thump, thump.
I pretended to patrol, heading to the back of the formation, observing the situation. 
To cut to the chase, Erwen's words were true.
"Here, eat this."
A priest giving her food to warriors.
And…
"Y, y, you're giving me… jerky? To me?"
A warrior experiencing a fit of disbelief, his eyes wide.
"Yes. You must be exhausted, right?"
"H, are you in love with me? If so, I can't accept this jerky. I have a wife and children in the city—"
"It's not like that, don't worry."
"What? You're giving me jerky even though you don't love me…?"
The warriors were shocked, but they quickly took the jerky and devoured it.  I could see this scene happening everywhere.
"Khhhhhh! T, this debt! I will repay this debt someday, even if it costs me my life!"
Countless warriors, moved by a single jerky, pledged their unwavering commitment, even shedding tears. 
It was truly a moving scene, even from my perspective.
"My policy… wasn't a failure…."
The sight of the expedition team, truly becoming one, helping each other.
"Lord Shuits? What did you just say to me?"
"Ah, I was… nothing."
"Yes. But why are you here… is it related to you suddenly stopping the expedition?"
In reality, I was just a bit guilty about snatching the jerky from Erwen, and wanted to check on the situation, but I simply nodded.  The expedition leader needs to maintain his dignity.
"What's the overall atmosphere today?"
"Today? Well…," 
"This morning, the food supply ran out, didn't it? Is anyone dissatisfied?"
"They are all strong individuals.  They've endured far worse than this. Skipping a meal for a day is nothing. Everyone understands that it's unavoidable."
"Is that so…."
I wasn't genuinely curious anyway, so I nodded casually and left.
***
After my conversation with Jun, I headed back to my team at the front.
"Oh, Shuits! Thanks for the last time!"
"You're getting thinner every day, aren't you?"
"It's just something I was eating, but have some anyway."
Warriors, who I knew, threw out greetings. Perhaps the most significant change that happened since Pike Neldian's execution.  No matter what team they belong to, we warriors would all draw our shields and charge out whenever a large-scale battle broke out.  It was inevitable that a sense of camaraderie would develop.
It wasn't just our relationship with the warriors that improved, though.
"……"
"……"
Unlike those warriors who were joking with me, the relationship with them is still a bit distant, but the look in their eyes toward me has softened.  Looking back on how they used to sneer and whisper every time they passed me by, I can't help but feel a sense of accomplishment.
‘This is probably all thanks to Neldian, that bastard.’
An enemy from the outside can unite a group.  When his betrayal was revealed, all the arrows of resentment that had been pointed at me turned toward him. And it was I who exposed his treachery.  It was inevitable that my evaluation would improve—
"Shuits, that man… is he clever or dumb? I can't figure it out."
"I heard that he suggested eating monster meat, but got scolded by his companion."
"He might be strange, but not stupid.  You saw how he managed to identify the traitor back then."
"Ah, that? But that was…  apparently, the mage figured it all out, and he just took the credit."
Heh,  I didn't know there was another traitor here.
I thought about subduing him immediately, but I changed my mind after hearing what followed.
"But isn't it also a sign of his ability to have capable subordinates?  Besides, he seems like a good person."
"That's… true. I haven't talked to him much, but he seemed kind."
"He's become the leader, so he could be a snob, but he always takes the initiative when it comes to hard work."
"Right, people like that will become your strongest allies when you're in trouble."
What? They're just ordinary colleagues.
Thump, thump.
I pretended not to hear their conversation and continued to the spot where my team was, but the 20-minute break, which was an unspoken rule, was almost over.
"Sir! What do you think? What I said is true, right?"
"That's right."
"Now, quickly eat, alright? Don't feel pressured. Everyone is doing it."
"Ah, that… I already ate on the way here."
"Heehee, good for you! I'm the only one left, aren't I?"
"Yeah, only you."
After a casual reply, I leaned against the wall and spent the remaining time fiddling with my ring.
As I was doing so, Amelia approached me.
"You're worried about why the light on your ring disappeared, aren't you?"
"Ah, well, yeah…."
The No. 6111 Destiny Tracker, which I called the traffic light ring, had suddenly lost its light.  It happened about four days ago.
"It's definitely strange. Once a destiny is detected, it shouldn't disappear without a reason."
"Exactly what I'm saying."
It's strange when you think about it again.  Nothing particularly good or bad happened, did it?
"Anyway, Shuits, it's about time."
Ah, already?
"Alright, everyone, get up. It's time to leave. If you took anything out of the sled, return it before we depart."
As I stretched my stiff body, I saw a dragon woman munching on something.
"Raviyen, didn't you eat everything this morning? Where did you get that jerky?"
"Ashid gave it to me."
“…Ashid gave it to you?"
I turned my head sharply, wondering if she had forcibly taken it, but Ashid let out a chuckle.
"It was my own choice. Don't worry."
"But you're struggling too, aren't you?"
"Haha, when we're struggling, it's only natural to help each other. Besides, if Raviyen is there, I'll feel safe."
"……"
It seemed like he hadn't forcibly taken it, so I didn't say anything further.  But I felt a sense of unease.
Is she, by any chance… in love with him?
‘Nah, that's impossible.’
I mean, how big is the age difference between them.
***
Day 20 of entering Ice Rock. 
We finally reached the end of Ice Rock. 
‘I never expected to reach it on exactly day 20.’
The plan we made was to traverse Ice Rock in 20 days.  Even though we pushed our speed to the limit due to various unfortunate incidents, we arrived on the exact day.
‘Maybe the plan itself was too tight from the start.’
If we had followed the original schedule, we probably would have arrived at this point two to three days later.  I was involved in making the plan as the leader, so let me offer an explanation. 
‘There were just too many unforeseen variables.’
We had definitely considered that most of the team was inexperienced during the planning phase.
But back then, it was just on paper.
We didn't know the team members' capabilities.  
An expedition team designed with the goal of war, not exploration.  Well, isn't that natural?
"Sir, what are you thinking so hard about?"
"Nothing."
I quickly dismissed my thoughts and looked around.  The very bottom of the ice glacier, with the pattern resembling human eyes.
"Alright, everyone calm down and wait! We'll draw lots in order!"
We only need to enter the portal to go to the 8th floor, but the atmosphere in the expedition team is chaotic.  For a simple reason.
This is the treacherous "Ice Rock," a place nobody comes to.
Of course, we are the first to arrive in this current batch.
"How do we decide the order?"
"Isn't it alright if anyone does it? Just let us go quickly. I'm starving."
"What? Then you're out!"
"What? Out? I never intended to join in the first place! I'm a mage!"
The maximum number of people who can use the binding magic is six.
Similarly, only six people can gain the experience for opening the portal for the first time. 
Therefore, we decided to draw lots fairly.
It was purely based on luck, without regard to their position, the expedition leader, or their contributions.
"Ugh! Damn it! Why is it blank?!"
"Hey! Don't even think about using your ability to check inside the box! I'm watching you!"
"Woo-hoo! 8th floor opening achievement!  This day has finally come!"
Shouts of joy and sighs of disappointment followed each other as the long line dwindled.
As I watched from the very back.
"Aren't you disappointed?"
Raviyen stood next to me, throwing me that question.
"What do you mean?"
"You're the expedition leader, right?  You could have taken the spot using your authority without anyone saying anything."
"Ah, you mean that."
It was a topic that was discussed among the team leaders.
We were talking about taking the experience points ourselves and drawing lots for the remaining spot.
By the way, Kailslan took it a step further, arguing that the remaining spot shouldn't be decided by lottery, but instead awarded to the person who made the most contributions.
Is that how you treat subordinates?
"…Are you listening?"
"Ah, yeah.  I'm listening."
"Why did you give up so easily?"
Raviyen asked, and I just shrugged in response.
What kind of answer is she looking for?
She knows why.
"Tsk, blank."
Amelia, who had drawn before me, clicked her tongue and patted me on the shoulder as she returned.
"Shuits, it's your turn."
"How many are left?"
"One."
Right, that's right.
I turned my head as little as possible, checking the number of people left in the back with my eyes.
‘There are four people left.’
Simply put, the odds are one in four.
And…
‘And Hans isn't among them.’
All the signs of fortune are on my side.
Whoooooosh—!
A cold gust of wind, descending from above, swept across the ground and rose again.
Swoosh.
I took off the ring I was wearing.
Because I don't need it now.
Thump, thump.
Destiny, in its true form, is something you pave with your own strength.
"Good luck."
Kailslan offered words of encouragement as I stood in front of the box.
It's time to start the game.
"Woooohoooo!"
I let out a warrior's cry and drew a lot.
And…
"Too bad. You got a blank."
Darn it.  It didn't work out.
Ah, is it because there's no BGM?
It's a rule to play it when you do this.
Thump, thump.
As I turned around listlessly, Raviyen passed by me.
Ah, she's next.
I thought she wouldn't really draw—
"This one with the round mark, is it correct?"
"Yes. Congratulations."
Wow, she got it?
‘If I had drawn just one turn later…  .’
I felt a pang of regret.
"Can this be transferred to someone else?"
"You didn't hear the explanation earlier, did you? We had a long discussion, and decided to allow it."
"Really?"
After a brief conversation with Kailslan, Raviyen turned around without hesitation and approached me.
"Here, take this."
She suddenly held out the slip of paper.
"……"
I couldn't understand it at all.
Wasn't she the one who said she needed to speedrun, and joined us only on the 6th floor?
I thought she needed those experience points desperately…
"Why are you giving this to me…?"
"It doesn't feel like it belongs to me, no matter how I think about it."
"…What?"
I tilted my head, confused, and Raviyen answered in a sheepish voice.
"I've been watching you all this time.  You're the one who's been working the hardest."
What… is this…
"Whooooosh!"
"Yeah, yeah! You're the one who brought us this far. It's only right that you open it!"
"Too bad. I was going to give it to you if nobody transferred it."
"Lies! You were so happy just now!"
"I'm telling the truth!  Even during our discussion earlier, I was the one who was on the side of allowing transfer!"
"Alright, just take it already! It's a rule for explorers to grab their own advantage when they can!"
The air is so cold that my breath freezes in the deep underground.
‘It's warm…  .’
I felt like crying.
