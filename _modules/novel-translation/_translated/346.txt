## Chapter 346: Seclusion (1)
Objectively, her stats were slightly superior to mine. And her equipment…?
“Overwhelmingly superior.”
Besides, she had been involved in war for over a year, beheading those Noark bastards. Her combat experience far surpassed mine by now. 
But there was no need to be intimidated. Erwen had made one crucial mistake.
A swift movement, barely perceptible.
Distance. 
As a skilled archer for whom distance control is paramount, I held the advantage at this range, even against the Spirit King’s contract holder. The fact that we were in a sealed room also worked to my advantage.
Furthermore, her mental state was far from stable.
“To, to attack me? How could you, how could you even…?”
Just a moment ago, she’d been calling me a demon.
I didn’t plan to give her much time. 
If we both started using our full strength, it would be impossible to finish this quietly.
With a decisive move, I tightened my hand into a fist, the size of a watermelon, and charged forward, launching myself from the ground.
However…?
A powerful gust of wind swept through the room.
My punch, which was supposed to be a surprise attack, sliced through thin air. 
Was she really a newbie?
“…Don’t, don’t do that.”
Well, this was to be expected.
With a heavy thud, I brought my body to a halt, my feet slamming against the floor.
“The character has cast [Eye of the Storm].”
A whirlwind formed around me, pulling everything around it.
It wasn’t connected to [Transcendence], so the radius was only five meters. Still, it was enough to cover the room we were standing in.
A powerful gust of wind whipped through the room.
The bed, blankets, pillows, bookshelf, desk, carpet… everything weighing under 500 kilograms was tossed about in the tempest. Of course, Erwen was caught in the whirlwind.
“…What is this?!”
Erwen, who had fought alongside Stormgush on Parune Island, was visibly startled. 
She must have been wondering why this skill was suddenly appearing.  I had intentionally hidden it when proving my identity, as it wasn’t my original Essence anyway.
A powerful gust of wind whipped through the room.
Erwen, having learned to adapt to various situations, reacted instantly. She summoned a wind spirit to resist the pull of the storm.
“St, stop it…!”
Stop? What do you mean stop?
“Didn’t I tell you? You have a problem.”
Keeping [Eye of the Storm] active, I walked towards her.
And…?
A powerful gust of wind swept through the room.
I lunged forward, fist extended.
Of course, I didn’t think it would actually hit Erwen. She would definitely dodge, and then I planned to use [Gigantification] to instantly increase my arm length.
Well, that was the plan, at least…
The [Eye of the Storm] duration ended, causing the furniture and objects caught in the tempest to fall to the ground.
And…?
“….”
Erwen remained standing.
Her eyes closed, standing before my outstretched fist.
“Why…?”
I couldn’t help but ask. 
If I hadn’t managed to stop myself in time, my fist would have hit Erwen. But why didn’t she dodge?
“Because… if I moved, you might get hurt…,” she said softly, opening her eyes slowly, with a look that suggested she was about to cry.
What?
My mind was still reeling from the sudden turn of events.
“You’re right… I do have a problem. I know it… but even so…,” she continued, her voice filled with despair.
“I, I wouldn’t hurt you.”
Oh…
I see…
A tear rolled down her cheek and fell onto the floor. I couldn’t find the words to respond.
“….”
This makes me look like the bad guy. 
***
Later, Erwen and I had a heartfelt conversation. 
It was a bit rambling at times, with her suddenly changing the subject and discussing completely unrelated things for extended periods. But in short, here’s what I learned:
She had been out of her mind ever since I died.
Driven by a desire for revenge, she endured unimaginable pain and managed to take the pure blood of her clan.
As soon as she gained power, war broke out. Seeing it as an opportunity for revenge, she sought out dangerous battlefields, not caring for her own life.
She also made a contract with the Spirit King during that time.
And…?
“I admit I went overboard, but I never intended to restrain you.”
She had boarded up the windows and restricted my outings to nighttime because she was so worried about me.
The rumors about me being a evil spirit had spread throughout the city.
It was an obsession. 
She couldn’t control herself because she was afraid of losing me again.
“What about Amelia?”
“…She’s the same. I can’t trust her. I’m absolutely certain I wouldn’t betray you, no matter what, but… I don’t know about her. I’m so worried…,” she whispered.
“….”
“But, from now on, I won’t do that. I won’t stop you from making her a teammate. To be honest, I’m still so worried, but…,” she added, her voice barely audible.
“But…?”
“…Because that’s what you want.”
Hmm, is she being sincere?
She didn’t seem to be lying… 
But I was still worried she might go crazy again suddenly. Still, for now, she seemed genuinely sincere.
Especially after she said this.
“About the Essences, if you ask me to erase them, I’ll go to the Temple tomorrow and erase them all. Then, I… I won’t be able to protect you anymore…,” she said quietly.
Most of Erwen’s Essences were ones she’d acquired through her achievements.
But she was willing to erase them all.
“…Why would you do that?”
It was still an incomprehensible reason. 
Were we that close?
Honestly, I couldn’t think of any other explanation.
But it felt wrong to say that to her in this situation. So, I didn’t say it aloud.
“…It might be better if you don’t erase the Essences.”
“…As you wish.”
“But if something like this happens again, be prepared to erase a few of them.”
“Yes, if you want—”
“This isn’t for me. This is for you.”
It was 100% sincere.
After all, Erwen wasn’t in her right mind right now.
If I kept feeding her sweet nothings and exploited her desire to avoid being disliked, controlling her wouldn’t be difficult.
But that would be wrong.
That’s not what comrades do.
I learned that from a magician in Larkaz’s Maze.
Therefore…?
“For, for me?”
I spoke firmly.
“Yes, for you. Or rather, for our relationship.”
“Our, our relationship…,” she murmured, her voice filled with confusion.
“…Do you understand?”
I gripped her shoulder, wanting to make sure she understood. 
And finally, she answered.
“Yes, yes…,” she said quietly, still sounding a bit dazed.
…Did she understand?
***
After that conversation, my life didn’t change drastically. 
I continued to live in seclusion, taking walks in the courtyard at night and never removing the boards from the windows. 
The only thing that changed was Erwen’s attitude.
“Here are your old things, mister.”
Erwen, who had been giving off the vibe that all she wanted was to hide in this house, started being more proactive in helping me.
It all started with the equipment.
“This is…,” I said, examining the item in my hand.
The Insignia of the No. 2988 Guard Corps. 
It had no stats or special effects, but when equipped, it added a whopping 50% shock absorption option to shields—one of the core items for Shield Barbarians.
“…Did you have this?”
“Yeah, of course I wasn’t going to sell it.”
Apparently, Raven had taken the lead in distributing the inheritance, and she had received this earring in the mail. Instead of selling it, she had simply kept it.
“But why are you giving it to me now? I’ve asked you about the equipment before.”
“I’m sorry… I didn’t want you to go into the Maze, so I hid it.”
So, it wasn’t just my imagination—she really did feel that way.
‘If I hadn’t been able to solve things properly last time, I might have really been raised in this house…,’ I thought, feeling a chill down my spine.
But there was no way that was actually true. 
Putting that unsettling thought aside, I checked out the rest of the equipment.
I figured she had already sold everything off and put it up for sale on the market, but now my thoughts were changing.
What if the others had kept their items, too?
“…I’ll have to look into that properly. But one thing is for sure, Abman Urickfrite sold everything off.”
“Abman?”
“Yeah. He said he only took things that weren’t particularly useful to you, like your old equipment. Things like that Space Ring.”
Hmm, I see.
He must have figured that the things you’d been wearing were a bit inconvenient to cash in, so he took the things that he could sell without guilt?
It was a little disappointing, but it wasn’t a big deal.
‘As long as I have this earring and the other one, I can just get the rest back.’
Shields and armor could be recreated.
The other Numbers Items weren’t that expensive either.
“Do you know who took my necklace?”
“Oh, you mean that thing that turns into random items when you put a magical stone in it?”
“Yeah.”
The official name was No. 7777 Garphas Necklace.
This necklace could be used to transform a magical stone into random substances. Like a gacha version of alchemy, it could turn a stone into bread, water, metal… anything.
It wasn’t particularly valuable. 
At least, not until I amassed enough wealth to unlock hidden special events.
“Actually… I wanted it, so I wrote to the magician—no, Arua Raven a while back. So, I know.”
“So? Who took it?”
“Misha Kalstein.”
“Ah…,” I sighed, feeling the air being sucked out of me.
Of all our teammates, she was the only one whose whereabouts were unknown. Well, I did hear that she was with Baekho at the Round Table, but…
That actually made things more confusing.
Everything felt like a mystery.
“….”
Still, I tried to focus on the positive side of things.
After all, wasn’t Misha pretty close to me?
There was a high possibility she had kept it, instead of selling it.
‘Hmm… but maybe not?’
It had been two years and six months, so I wasn’t sure anymore.
So, I decided to put that issue on hold for later.
‘Anyway, I have a feeling Ainahr might have taken the armor and weapons… which means the rest probably went to Raven?’
While I was contemplating the whereabouts of my old equipment, a specific item came to mind.
‘Oh, the Flame Orb… I wonder what happened to that?’
It was the only bound item I had.
If my disappearance in this timeline was perceived as death, it could have been sold. Otherwise, there was a high chance she had kept it.
‘If it’s the latter, then Raven is probably the most likely to have it…,’ I thought.
“Whew…,” I sighed again, feeling a weight settle on my chest.
It wasn’t like I hadn’t gained anything from the past, but the amount of cleanup I had to do after all that was overwhelming.
“Mister, won’t you eat?”
“Ah… I was just thinking about something else for a moment.”
I finally shook off my thoughts and took a bite of the food Erwen had packed from the dining hall. As soon as I finished eating, I had a quick chat with her.
“What are you planning to do from now on?”
“…First, I have to get rid of this demon accusation.”
“How about I… use my powers to get you a spot?”
Erwen suggested that I have her prove my innocence in front of everyone in the royal family, but I decided to decline.
It was too early.
I knew I’d eventually have to do that, but I had a feeling that there was something political involved in my case, and it just felt too risky.
“We need to be more cautious about this. It could backfire and affect the whole fairy race, including you.”
“…You, you’re so kind.”
“Ahem. Anyway, I need you to gather information focusing on Raven and Abman. Forget about them for now.”
“Yes! I will.”
After our conversation, Erwen said she had to visit the holy land, and I went to the living room on the first floor to take a nap.
That’s when it happened.
Knock, knock.
Someone was knocking on the front door. 
Erwen wouldn’t have any reason to knock.
