## Chapter 22: Level Up (2)
I skipped the daily routine of library, city adaptation, and combat training. A true explorer wouldn't spend their time on such trivial matters, especially not on the day the labyrinth opened.
[08:10]
I rushed to the meeting point without even bothering with breakfast, determined to meet Einar. I'd heard that even the slightest delay could mean waiting hours longer.
To my surprise, Einar was already waiting for me. 
"Here you are! Bjorn, son of Jandel!"
"You were here before me? But… how long have you been here?"
"Didn't I say we'd leave you behind if you were late? That's why I slept right here!  Hurry! We're first!"
"...Okay."
Despite the entrance being thirty minutes away from opening, the line was already snaking around the block. Thanks to Einar, though, we were able to enter the Explorers' Guild immediately after the doors opened.
"What is your business?"
"We are here to receive the bonding magic."
"Are there two of you in your team?"
"That's right."
"Place your hands here together."
As instructed, we placed our hands on the crystal orb, which emitted a faint green light.
"Two 9th-grade explorers. The cost is 15,000 stones."
15,000 stones... If I hadn't been saving money, I might have been a bit short.
I reluctantly opened my pouch and paid the fee. It was a necessary expense, though it stung. The labyrinth entrance spawns adventurers randomly, but with this magic, at least we would start in the same location.
"What determines an explorer's grade?"
"It's measured by the total amount of essence inscribed in the soul."
"I see. So the cost of bonding increases as the grade goes up?"
"Of course."
Ugh, did everything have to be exactly like the game?
"It's done. This magic only lasts for 24 hours, so be aware."
"Understood."
We finished our business and left the guild, just after nine in the morning.
"Let's head back to our inn for a meal. They have decent food."
"Inn? You mean the inn cooks for you?"
What kind of life has this kid lived?
I subtly asked him, and Einar replied nonchalantly,
"I usually bought bread from the labyrinth."
Ah, that bread that cost 20 stones each. I tried to save money by eating it, but gave up quickly. I don't know what the principle is, but the bread that was decent in the labyrinth tasted like stone here.
‘That's why it was called "stone bread"...’
He lived off that for a month?
My heart ached a little, so I ordered him meat and stew. Einar then pledged his loyalty.
"Bjorn! I'd jump into a fiery furnace for you! So don't abandon me!"
After our tear-jerking meal, we went back to our room to pack our bags.
"Be thorough.  If you forget something essential, you'll be in trouble."
"Don't worry! I have nothing to pack!"
We checked our equipment and organized our supplies into our backpacks, time slipped by surprisingly quickly. 
"Then let's get some sleep."
"This is the most comfortable bed I've ever seen! Two of us could sleep here! And it doesn't even smell!"
We finished our preparations, ready to enter the labyrinth at any moment, and lay down side by side.
But it's actually quite cramped sleeping with him. When I slept with Erwen, there was space to spare.
"Even if you can't sleep, try to rest your eyes. You won't get a proper sleep for a while-"
Wait, what was I worried about?
Dr-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-rrng-!
Before I could finish, the sound of a pure barbarian snore filled the air.
I chuckled and closed my eyes. 
How much time passed?
[20:30]
We woke up a bit early and had one last meal on the first floor. We splurged on the special meal, which cost 800 stones each.
"What in the world is this flavor?"
Einar, who had been excited throughout the meal, took a bite of the cream pie served for dessert and froze.
"Is, is this magic? I, I keep tearing up."
"Ah, that, my friend, is what we call 'sweetness'."
"I feel like I need to live a good life…."
It wasn't intentional, but it seemed like he received a proper motivational boost.
"Let's go."
We packed our things and stepped out into the night. There were more people on the streets than usual. Most were armed like me, carrying huge backpacks. As I mentioned, not everyone was like that; I saw some barbarians with just a weapon and their bare skin. They seemed like they had just finished their coming-of-age ceremony and entered the city.
"Stop! We seem to be lost!"
"No way! We have to reach the labyrinth before the deadline!"
"Partoon doesn't have the qualifications to be a leader!"
So this was a regular occurrence. How did these guys always manage to reach the labyrinth?
I was seriously contemplating this when Einar approached them and offered advice.
"If you follow them, you'll reach the labyrinth."
The young warriors looked at her with admiration, like a successful senior.
"Thank you. We will never forget this kindness!"
As they walked away, Einar wiped her nose.
“…Hmph, brings back memories.”
I wish she hadn't pretended it was from the past. She seems exactly the same now as she did back then.
"Everyone step back!"
The Dimensional Square was already packed with thousands of people.  We pushed through the crowd, waiting for midnight.  In the center, a light began to erupt. It started small, but quickly grew, pulsing as a sphere.
"You may enter now!"
The official yelled, and the explorers around us rushed towards the portal.
I led Einar away from the surging crowd to the outskirts of the square.
"Bjorn, are we not going in?"
"Wait a bit."
The number of explorers gathered in the square was decreasing by dozens every second, but the crowd remained. It was due to other explorers arriving continuously.
Forty minutes after the portal opened, the bustling Dimensional Square had thinned out, with only seven or eight hundred people remaining.
“…Should we go in now?”
The portal, which had already swallowed tens of thousands of explorers, had shrunk considerably.
But I continued to wait.
Einar, who was not entirely oblivious, changed his tone.
"Bjorn, what are you waiting for?"
Well, explaining it would take too long… 
And I'm not even sure if it will work.
But since we had some time left, I decided to explain briefly.
"I plan to enter when the dimension becomes unstable. The book said it happens once every hundred years, but if we use this phenomenon-"
"I don't understand, but I'll follow your lead."
“…?”
"It just feels like I won't understand anyway!"
I honestly knew this would happen.  Getting asked and then getting that response is annoying…
But on the other hand, it's convenient to be able to omit explanations for every action.
"The gate is about to close! Please stand back!"
Finally, the portal's light began to fade.
There were no explorers left.
Only then did I slowly walk towards the labyrinth with Einar.
An official shouted at us,
"It's dangerous to enter now!"
I ignored him. 
I don't understand why they say it's dangerous. 
There's even a book with statistics, so they must be aware of this phenomenon…
"Bi, Bjorn! The tall guy says it's dangerous! We need to get out of here!"
Why don't they use this phenomenon?
***
One, two, three…
Well, counting doesn't seem to matter.
I got a feeling this is the time.
"Now. Let's go in."
"Ugh!"
I pushed Einar's back and entered the labyrinth simultaneously.
Flash-!
A flash blinded me, and when I opened my eyes, I was greeted by the deep darkness.
It means my plan worked.
"I, I can't see! I should have listened to the tall guy! Bjorn is an idiot!"
"Einar, calm down."
I quickly lit the torch I took out of my backpack, and Einar regained his composure.
"Wh, what in the world is going on?"
"You wouldn't understand even if I told you."
"That… that's probably true!"
Easily pacified, I looked around.  And I was struck with a strange emotion upon discovering a stone monument in front of a dead end.
The dimensional instability phenomenon was indeed closely linked to the portal's entry point.
I was happy, but also a bit sad.
It meant that if I had made my decision just one minute faster during the initial entry, I wouldn't have been crawling on three legs with one foot mangled!
Woooo-ooong-!
As I placed my hand on the stone, a beam of light erupted, transforming into a sphere.
"What is this?"
"It's a portal to the second floor."
In short, we skipped all the steps of finding our way with a compass, fighting monsters as they appeared, and navigating through the darkness.
We saved at least a day or two.
"What?! The chieftain said it would take three days to find a portal! What kind of magic did you use?"
You wouldn't understand even if I told you.
「You have opened a portal for the first time. EXP +2」
「Your character has leveled up.」
「Soul Power increased by +10.」
「Maximum Essence Absorption increased by +1.」
You need to exploit bugs to become a true veteran.

「Bjorn Jandel」
Level: 2 (New +1)

「You have entered the Goblin Forest on the second floor.」
I soared about 3 meters into the air and quickly regained my balance, landing on both feet.
Thump!
I had practiced. 
With the barbarians. 
"Ugh!"
I couldn't help but chuckle as I watched Einar fall flat on his butt.  I could finally understand Erwen's laughter when she saw me.
"Ugh, my butt hurts."
It's quite funny to watch. 
But this kid, with his reflexes, will land properly soon enough.
"What?  Why do you look disappointed?"
"Nothing."
I casually brushed it off, pulled out my watch, and set it to 00:05.
I was supposed to do it right when I woke up, but I forgot.
Still, setting it 5 minutes earlier shouldn't be a problem.
“…Einar, do you feel it?”
"Feel what?"
"Like, my heart is vibrating."
It's like a dense substance is coursing through my veins, filling my body.
It's been happening since I crossed the portal, and now I can feel it clearly.
What is it?
I described the sensation, and Einar quickly diagnosed it.
"Your soul rank must have risen! Congratulations!"
Ah, so I leveled up.
[Dungeon & Stone] also has levels.
Levels increase soul power, or MP—the resource needed to use abilities—and the total number of essence you can absorb.
For example, as a level 1, I could only absorb one essence…
But now that I’m level 2, I can absorb two.
Well, they both need to actually drop for that to matter.
"It's amazing.  My soul rank went up without even killing a monster!"
"There's nothing to be surprised about.  It seems you're being credited for opening the portal for the first time."
‘Merit’ is the term used for experience in this world.
"Hmm, does opening a portal even earn merit?"
Yes.
Or rather, 'speedrunning' is the easiest way to gain experience once you reach a certain level.
[Dungeon & Stone] has a unique growth system.
You can only earn experience from the same monster once. So you have to kill various monsters, like collecting them in a bestiary, to level up.
Wait a minute, isn't this a bit dangerous?
“…Einar, this is a secret between you and me.  Understood?"
"Secret? What do you mean?"
"Opening the portal for the first time.  That's all.  If anyone asks, say we took two days to get to the second floor."
The experience for opening the portal is only 2, or about two 9th-grade monsters…
‘But unlike monsters, it accumulates.’
So adventurers who have reached a certain level desperately try speedrunning.
Because you can only hunt a limited number of monsters based on your compatibility with them, their location, the presence of a mage, and the god that a priest serves.
You have to grind merit to break through walls you hit.
But it's possible to do this from low levels?
I have to keep this trick to myself.
It's not good for me if it gets out.
"I swear by the warrior's honor."
Did I look serious?
Einar changed his expression and even swore before I told him to. It gave me a bit of peace of mind, but I had to act quickly.
"We have to leave this place."
Adventurers will soon enter the second floor, in a few hours.  They'll see us, two beginners, and wonder.
How come you got here before us?
It's better if we don't stand out.
As always, I’m more afraid of adventurers than monsters.
