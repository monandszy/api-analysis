##  The Jester (1)
A desperate gamble. It's a term often used to describe a situation where one has no room to retreat, a last stand for survival. I find it quite appealing, for there's a certain truth to it, wouldn't you agree?
People tend to give their all when their backs are against the wall. Moreover, with no path to escape, there's no need to look over your shoulder. You can focus all your energy on the enemy before you. It has a certain practical appeal, just like now.
Crash!
Before me stood my enemies, the ones I needed to vanquish.
Whoosh!
Behind me, the city was ablaze, a roaring inferno. While this prevented the enemy from flanking us, it also meant our escape was cut off. But that didn't matter; I had no intention of retreating.
Crash!
In a way, this was always how Ehan-su had lived. He was always forced to fight in a corner, with no escape route. It was the only option he had.
‘The pediatric ward.’
He fought the disease with everything he had.
‘The amusement park.’
He fought against the pain of being abandoned.
‘My room.’
Since then, he’d been locked in an endless battle against loneliness, a fight with no victor.
[We were born warriors. If we don't fight, we die.]
A life not unlike that of the barbarians, in a way. But in reality, there was a crucial difference between us.
[You still haven't cured that habit of running away.]
I fought when I had no choice. But those words always meant that I ran away. In truth, if there was an option, I would always choose to escape.
Crash!
I hated fighting. I knew better than anyone how hard it was. More importantly, there weren't many things I wanted to fight for, not like now.
Crash!
This time was different.
“Raveeeen!!”
As soon as I called out her name, my loyal companion followed my foolish plan and unleashed her magic.
“Aruha Raven has cast the level 4 attack magic [Water Cannon].”
“Aruha Raven has cast the level 6 auxiliary magic [Property Conversion].”
The flames engulfing the city raged even fiercer.
Wooooooosh!
Astarotta, following close behind, scattered potent aura with each sword strike, proving why she was the King's bodyguard.
“……Mon, monster!”
“Damn it, where did a monster like that come from?!”
An overwhelming battle despite our numerical disadvantage. It was inevitable; in this world, even a character built for just corpse gathering could be considered a one-man army.
‘Let alone someone as powerful as the King’s closest aide.’
I was no different. Now that I had nearly perfected the Shield Barbarian, I wouldn’t shy away from a fight with anyone.
‘The setup is perfect too.’
Best of all, I didn’t need to worry about the rear.
Boom! Boom!
With earth-shaking footsteps, I charged into the enemy lines like a tank, disrupting their formations. Then Astarotta, like a blender, pulverized everything in her path.
“Behel—laaaaaaa!!”
“Don’t get too excited. Only foot soldiers, the real ones must be in the back.”
He’s trying to dampen my spirits, acting like he’s giving me advice. If I were the King, he’d never dare open his mouth.
‘……Well, he’s not entirely wrong.’
These were just distractions; the real challenge was yet to begin. The Corpse Gatherer, the Blood Knight, and the other Orcullis members—none of them had revealed themselves yet. 
So… 
Kzzzt!
I needed to keep moving while I had the chance. Once they were ready, breaking through would be much harder.
Tada-tada-ta-ta-ta!
I increased my speed. 
Crash! Crash!
The sound of my strikes echoed even louder as my arms and legs moved faster. But then, the enemy forces began to retreat.
“Fall back!”
“Keep your distance! Distance!”
They fell back as we advanced, their backs exposed.  Of course, they said they were falling back, but it was practically the same as a full retreat.  After all, we were charging at full speed.
“A, aaahh!!”
Crash!
“S, save—!”
Slice!
How long did I chase them, smashing the heads of those who fell behind? 
‘So, about halfway there….’
One more push like this, and I’d reach the 7th district, my home away from home.  Wait, that means I’ve already burned down more than half of the 8th district?
“A, ah… no—!”
Crash!
As I chased the reaper of death, setting the whole city ablaze, I suddenly felt like I was the villain. But I didn’t feel any guilt.
In this world, those who view the enemy as ‘people’ don’t last long.
Zzzzt!
I guess the easy part ends here.
Flash!
An overwhelming wave of magical energy blazed from afar, enveloping the area in a dazzling light.
“Defense successful.”
“The Aegis Barrier has absorbed all damage.”
Thankfully, the attack was smaller than my shield, so I managed to guard against it. But that didn’t mean I could relax.  
The fact that they had deployed elite troops meant they were finally ready to stop me.
‘Time to get serious.’
I prepared to face them head-on.
“Character has cast [Ironclad Fortress].”
“Character has cast [Scales of Greed].”
No sooner had I activated both Knight Crusher and Mage Crusher modes, a group of roughly twenty people appeared in front of me. 
As this was a game that required good gear, their attire was not uniform.  But the very fact that their looks were so diverse gave them an air of elite prowess.
Not that I was particularly nervous about it.
“This is where it ends.”
An all too familiar face stood amongst those who looked elite. Seeing it, I immediately felt the threat level drop.
“Even you, though, can’t hold out against this many.  Heh… .”
Just a moment ago, he was fleeing for his life, abandoning even his allies.  He’s puffing his chest now, all because he has new friends.
“Avet Necrapeto!  You son of a bitch!!”
Rilanne Vivienne screamed, enraged at the sight of him.
“Heh, heh… Vivienne, it’s been a while.  You look well!  I’ve returned to save you, so why don’t you—.”
“Shut your mouth! You’re dead, you bastard!”
“Heh heh… Does that mean you’re betraying Orcullis and joining their side?”
“You’re the one who betrayed us!”
“Why would I betray you? In the end, you weren’t killed or injured, and now I’ve returned with reinforcements to save you.”
“…What? Yandell-nim!!  No, Yandell oppa!! Please, let me kill him! I’ll do anything you say….!”
Vivienne, completely blinded by rage, started offering empty promises that I hadn’t even asked for.
The Corpse Gatherer shook his head at her. 
“Oh dear… looks like it’s too late. They say that once a woman goes for a barbarian, they don’t ever think of getting her back.”
“Aaaaaaaarghh!!”
Seeing her wail in despair, it was clear that the verbal battle was Vivienne’s defeat.  But, it was not a good situation for the black magic user, who needed to fight alongside us now, to be blinded by rage and excitement.
“Pathetic.”
I cut into the conversation, tossing in a casual remark.
“The jealousy of a small man.”
“………Yes?”
As expected, he was immediately offended.
“You, you… what did you just say……?”
“I said the jealousy of a small man is pathetic.”
“…W, what are you talking about?  T, that was a battle, it was obvious—!”
“I was referring to your height.”
I cut him off and brought up his height, and as he’d never anticipated this, he froze.  Like he’d gone into a Grogi state in a game.
“Pathetic.”
“…….”
“Even your excuses.”
I landed a critical hit, and of course, he was completely frozen, unable to speak.
“Wow… .”
Even Vivienne, who had been screaming with fury, seemed to be impressed, her jaw dropping.  
Seeing him get shredded like that, her rage seemed to subside, and her excitement vanished.
“That’s enough talking.”
A man who seemed to be the commander of the enemy forces pushed the Corpse Gatherer aside and stepped forward. Hmm, I’d never seen him before.
“Bjorn Yandell, your exploits end here.”
“Huh?”
“Don’t worry.  I’ll carry on your legacy.”
Oh, I thought he was a serious guy based on his looks.  His lines are straight out of an extra character.
Woooosh!
I chuckled and threw a hand axe.
“Remember the name of the man who will kill you. My name is Nortia—!”
“Oh, but you still block this, I see.”
“……Ugh! Kill him!”
He gave his orders, his words cut short, and the battle began.
