## Wild Horse (4)
It’s like the psychology of someone visiting a zoo. They look at the caged beasts and say they’re cute, or feel sorry for them being locked up. But it’s not difficult to realize that this is arrogance. 
A cage with a diameter of 3 centimeters. 
If that cage were to disappear, the dividing line between themselves and the beast would be broken, and humans would finally be able to look into the beast’s true nature.
Just like the Marquess now. 
“…”
Ah, of course, the Marquess was different from ordinary people. Even in the face of my sincere and aggressive words, he merely flinched slightly before quickly regaining his composure. 
After all, the cage hadn't actually disappeared.
I can't kill the Marquess. 
And the Marquess knows this best of all. 
So, that’s why…
“Well, do you consider that a sufficient answer?”
I ended the conversation nonchalantly, as if it were simply an answer to a question. 
It would be a lie to say I didn’t want to see the Marquess’s face sour, but for now, I had to be satisfied with this much. 
“Don’t worry.”
The Marquess replied with those words. 
“I understand the meaning of what you wanted to convey.”
“That’s a relief.”
In fact, it was also a warning. If we were in a give-and-take relationship, I’d be open to cooperating. But if you cross the line, I’m ready to break down the cage and charge at any moment. 
“So, now that your curiosity is satisfied, I’d like to hear about the second condition.”
“Ah, about that. The second condition is this.”
The Marquess glanced at the Dragonkin woman beside him and continued. 
“Help Miss Raviyen to kill the Dragonslayer, Regal Bagos.”
“The Dragonslayer…?”
“That’s an unexpected reaction. From what I’ve heard from Miss Raviyen, you have some history with him, don’t you?”
It’s true, but this is a request I never anticipated. 
‘…She must be the one who knows about what happened between the Dragonslayer and me.’ 
Suddenly, I’m curious.
What’s the relationship between the Marquess and this Dragonkin woman?
It’s clear that she’s deeply involved in the Dragonslayer’s death becoming the second condition.
Is it a business deal?
“Now, will you give me your answer?”
My curiosity burns, but it was time to answer. 
Ah, just one more question.
“But did you really have to make me wait until tomorrow just to say this?”
“Miss Raviyen was away from home at the time. I thought it was appropriate to have this conversation where she was.”
Well, if that’s the case.
“Fine.  I was going to kill that bastard myself eventually anyway.”
“Then that settles it.”
“I haven’t heard anything about a satisfactory compromise yet.”
I extended my wrist, now fully healed, and spoke.  The Marquess laughed heartily.
“Let’s leave it at that for today. We’ll meet again tomorrow morning. I’m too tired lately, even if I stay up a little late.”
“…”
“Alright.”
The conversation came to an end. The Marquess rose from his seat and turned away. The Dragonkin woman swiftly put the chair away into her subspace.
And then…
“Jandel, Viscount, don’t be too reckless.”
The bodyguard muttered something, looking at me. 
Was this revenge for what I said earlier?
That was my initial thought, but it didn't take long to realize that was not the case. 
“My younger sister would be sad if you died again.”
“Younger sister? Oh, so you are…?”
“…”
The Dragonkin bodyguard neither confirmed nor denied. 
She simply turned and followed the Marquess. 
But that was answer enough. 
Ah, I thought her features seemed familiar. 
‘Penitasaurus.’
The daughter of the Primordial Dragon and the Dragon Priestess, Penny.
Dragon Brat, for short.
So she was her older sister.
Someone who might have even become my companion. 
***
Eltora Tercelion, heir to the Marquessate.
When he regained consciousness, the first thing he saw was his biological father. 
“You’re awake.”
“I apologize.”
Eltora didn’t ask any questions and offered an apology first. 
But the response he received was icy. 
“Do you think I was guarding you all night just to hear those words?”
“…”
“Tell me. What happened, tell me everything without missing a detail.”
His father’s words made Eltora slowly retrace his memories, briefly recounting the events that had transpired at midnight. 
There wasn’t much to tell.
He had infiltrated his father's guest room at night, as ordered, and was immediately grabbed by the neck. Before he could even utter a word of defense, he was beaten senseless and collapsed.
That was the entire story.
“Pathetic.”
Eltora endured the humiliation without speaking. 
He couldn’t offer any justification this time. 
He simply couldn’t help but wonder.
“But why did you choose this method? If you wanted to confirm whether he was an Evil Spirit or not, there must have been a more definitive way…?”
Initially, he thought it was because he didn’t want to anger Jandel, the Viscount. 
His father had acknowledged him as a valuable tool. 
But upon reflection, something seemed strange.
No, to be precise, there must have been another reason.
“Are you incapable of even this much independent thought?”
“…Please enlighten me.”
As Eltora took a humble stance, the Marquess simply furrowed his brows slightly and answered his question.
“An enemy’s weakness is most valuable when they’re unaware of it.”
“An undisclosed weakness is concealed, but an exposed weakness is something they’ll strive to correct.”
“It’s a relief that you seem to grasp this much.”
“…”
“Now, leave. I have things to think about.”
“Yes…?”
Eltora, with a dejected air, started to leave the room but stopped short. 
Suddenly, he had a question.
“Father…?”
“If you have something to say, speak quickly.”
“You said ‘an enemy’s weakness’ just now… Does that mean you consider Jandel, the Viscount, as an enemy?”
Perhaps his father’s true intentions had been accidentally revealed.
However, Eltora was unable to hear the answer.
“It’s not your concern. Go.”
“Yes…?”
Eltora left his father’s office and headed towards his bedroom. 
His mind was still racing.
‘Jandel, the Viscount, as an enemy to the Marquess…?’
What kind of scheme was the Marquess concocting? 
Lost in these thoughts, he eventually arrived at his destination.
But…
Rattle, rattle, rattle.
For some reason, his hand, holding the key, trembled.
This wasn’t the room he had just opened but the one he’d been using for years.  Yet, it felt like a beast was slumbering within, waiting to be awakened the moment he opened the door. 
He could even hear whispers in his ear. 
[Eltora Tercelion.]
A deep voice that sent a shiver down your spine.
His gaze, as if looking down upon him.
And…
[…You’d better be prepared to die.]
That feeling, that he couldn’t escape no matter what he did when facing this man. 
Unpleasant deja vu flooded Eltora, and he instinctively recalled a certain man. 
Well, it was impossible, but…
[I first joined this community 22 years ago.]
Bjorn Jandel wasn’t even born back then.
“The Goblins would laugh if they knew I was having these delusions.”
He chuckled and shook his head.
He inserted the key and opened the locked door.
Click.
A typical nobleman’s room adorned with armor, a longsword, and a stuffed deer head. 
As always, it was far removed from his taste.
***
The next morning, he was summoned by the Marquess for breakfast.
When I arrived, there were only two people in the dining room: the Marquess, seated at the table, and the Dragonkin, standing behind him.
“Where’s your son?”
“He’s resting comfortably.”
Isn’t it customary for the son to be present on such occasions?
I wondered about that, but I preferred fewer people at the table. 
Well, maybe I should consider this an act of courtesy towards me?
“Eat.”
I started with the meal, naturally engaging in conversation. 
I had things to discuss with him today.
For example, the “compromise” I mentioned yesterday.
“Tell me, is there anything you desire as compensation for our mistakes?”
“Before that, there’s something I’d like to confirm.”
“Go ahead.”
“How long will it take me to regain my name?”
“We’re aiming for about three months. This matter needs to be handled flawlessly.”
Three months…
The moment I heard that, it felt too long. But I could understand the Marquess’s position. He had to flawlessly fabricate Bjorn Jandel’s two-year record of infiltrating Noirarc under a royal decree, from beginning to end.
“During that time, your role is crucial. If your name becomes known before preparations are complete, someone might become suspicious and investigate.”
“Marquess, can’t you prevent that?”
“We’ll try to prevent it if the situation arises, but we can’t guarantee it won’t leak out. That’s how the royal palace is.  One person can’t control everything.”
In short, unless you’re the king, who’s the actual ruler of this country, it’s impossible to completely control government agencies.
Considering his reputation as someone who turned the king into a figurehead, his statement felt rather tame.  But it wasn’t entirely unreasonable. 
The Prime Minister, though undoubtedly the second-in-command, doesn’t have a lone contender. 
Take the Duke of Kealrunes, for instance.
One of their bloodline is the Tower Master, and historically, they’ve been actively involved in Labyrinth-related projects.  They’re a grand noble family with a strong influence on major clans.
In truth, the Marquessate, with their “Prime Minister” status, seems to have less diverse outputs and fewer areas of influence compared to the Duke of Kealrunes.
“Now that you’ve understood the timeframe, I’d like to hear what you wanted to say.”
“I want to meet the tribe’s Shaman.”
“Why?”
He asks the obvious.
Ah, maybe it’s because he’s not a Barbarian?
When a warrior seeks a Shaman, there’s only one reason.
“I need to receive a Soul Branding.”
I had reached level 6, but the Soul Branding had stopped there. I even bought the materials for level 7, but it was interrupted when I was suddenly pulled into the past.
Luckily, the ‘Soul of the Dead,’ which was the material, is being kept by Raven as my inheritance.  So once this identity issue is resolved, I can get the Branding.
That’s why…
“As I said before, if your name gets out before everything is ready, it will be difficult to—”
I cut off the Marquess.
“That’s what I meant.  Take care of it.  Make sure I don’t have to worry about it.”
“So, that’s your ‘compromise.’”
“Yes, I don’t know what might happen in the next Labyrinth. Three months is too long.”
My request made the Marquess ponder for a moment.  However, considering that he wanted me to participate in the war, it might be advantageous for him that my fighting power increased.
“Alright. I’ll see to it that you can meet the Shaman this month.”
“Good.”
I didn’t bother asking about how he would summon and convince the Shaman. 
That’s his job.
Considering how he handles things, I’m sure he’ll take care of it neatly.
Thud.
The meal ended with that exchange. 
But we left our empty plates as they were and continued talking for a while. 
There were still things we needed to discuss.
“I mentioned organizing a unit with you at its core. Have you given it any thought?”
“I intend to form a unit of thirty members.”
“That’s a total of five teams. So, have you decided who to fill those spots with?”
“I haven’t yet, but I have some candidates in mind.”
The Marquess then rattled off a list of names of prospective members he had in mind. I was quite surprised as I listened. 
Many of the names were familiar, even to me, who wasn’t well-versed in current affairs.
A member of the Seven Strong.
An ace from a large clan.
A renowned Paladin.
A prominent military figure known for their strength, and so on.
Was the Marquess trying to create a dream team?
“But will those guys agree to join?”
“They will. Most of them, at least. I’m planning to offer enormous rewards.”
“…If that’s the case.”
Realistically, I wondered if that was possible, but seeing his confidence, it seemed at least somewhat feasible.
We then discussed the next part.
“Jandel, Viscount, you’ll be in charge of one of the three teams. And Miss Raviyen will be on that team.”
“So, that means I can have four more people besides myself.”
“Those two will likely be included.”
It was obvious who ‘those two’ were.
They must be Erwen and Amelia. 
‘So, they’re aware of Amelia. I wonder if they even know she’s from Noirarc?’
Despite my concerns, I nodded.
“That’s the plan.”
“So, there are only two spots left. If you don’t have anyone in mind, tell me which names you’d like from the ones I mentioned earlier. I’ll try to bring them in with better conditions, even if I have to bribe them.”
Additional members, huh…
The first name that came to mind was Raven.
My team needs a mage, and Raven wouldn’t disappoint in terms of skill or reliability. 
But what about the navigator?
I can’t put him in the remaining spot. 
Should I just leave him in the basement until the war is over? 
‘This… I’ll discuss it with Amelia later. And I should ask Raven before mentioning her to the Marquess.’
I finished my brief contemplation and spoke.
“I’ll get back to you on that.”
“Right.”
That concluded our conversation for the day.
Just as I was about to get up, the Marquess opened his mouth.
“Ah, there’s one more matter I need to discuss with you.”
“…?”
“This unit isn’t something I planned on my own.”
“What do you mean?”
“In short, it’s intertwined with the interests of several factions. The only thing I can do with my own power is to give you command of one of the five teams.”
“So? What are you trying to say?”
The Marquess stared at me directly and replied.
“Do you think they’ll just accept the fact that someone else is going to lead them? Even if they do, their patrons won’t stand for it.”
Right, so it’s a political issue. 
It seems like this unit’s creation involves a lot of influential figures, even beyond the Marquess’s power.
Well, this is good for me.
I’m starting to understand what the Marquess wants to say.
“Anyway… so once we have all thirty members and team leaders, we’ll have a competition to choose the right person.”
“…”
“If this newly formed unit achieves great feats in the war, the patron of the commander will also share in the rewards.”
The Marquess paused, briefly examining my expression before continuing.
“So, do you think you can do it?”
A short question, but his intention was crystal clear.
I chuckled in response.
Because asking if I could do it was a bit off.
“I suppose I can.”
To be honest…
The guys I mentioned earlier, they’re all pretty damn good.
“If the reward is good enough.”
I don’t think anyone could beat me.
