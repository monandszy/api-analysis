## Captain Barbarian (1)
The first floor living room of Erwin's mansion, a house equipped with CCTV systems.  Three women sat neatly on the sofa, sipping their tea.
"A special force of thirty," Raven murmured. "I've never heard of such a thing. It must be a highly classified operation."
Amelia added, "Since the war has dragged on, perhaps the royal family is trying to find a way to turn the tide."
"Yes," Raven said. "Considering the reputation of the inner circle members the Viscount mentioned, I wonder if they can actually form a team."
"But there's no doubt about it. The Viscount made a firm statement."
"Then it's safe to assume they're planning something big, something that requires that much force."
Raven and Amelia discussed the situation with serious expressions, while Erwin seemed uninterested.
"You don't like sweets that are too sweet, right? Have this. I bought it especially for you."
"Ah, thanks."
As I ate the peanut cookie Erwin gave me, Raven looked at me with a displeased frown.  It seemed she wasn't happy with me just explaining the situation and then sitting there quietly.
After swallowing the cookie, she finally spoke.
"Raven, what are you going to do?"
"Do? What do you mean?"
"Didn't I tell you? There are two spots left in the team, including me, Erwin, Emily, and the dragonborn the Viscount recruited."
"Oh."
"I'd like you to join us."
My direct question caused Raven to hesitate slightly and avoid my gaze.
"I want to help on the front lines too, but I think it'll be difficult right now."
Her answer was inevitably disappointing.
"Is that so?"
I tried to hide my disappointment, but Raven sensed it and explained the situation without being asked.
"The Commander has been called away frequently, both on the battlefield and in the city. If I leave now, there will be no one to manage the Magic Squad."
She was so devoted.
Well, that’s why I trusted her as a comrade.
I hated seeing her so dejected, even though it wasn’t her fault, so I quickly changed the subject.
"Why are you making excuses? If you’re busy, you’re busy."
"Thank you for understanding."
"Understanding, my foot. There’s nothing to apologize for."
"…"
Anyways, Raven’s recruitment was off the table.
How am I going to fill the remaining two spots?
While I was pondering this, Amelia approached me in a hushed tone.
"Shuietz, do you think we need a navigator in the team?"
"Well, we'll be traveling on a large warship, so I don't think we need one."
"Is that so."
Amelia nodded without any further complaints, but there was a strange atmosphere. Was she perhaps thinking of bringing the basement navigator, Auyen?
Even if she loves sailing, there are things called TPO, you know…
"I think it’s better to leave Auyen alone for now. We might need him again after the war."
"Understood. He hasn’t been eating well lately and I’ve been worried, but maybe I should just increase his walks."
"…" "Yes, that’ll do."
That settles the navigator issue.
"By the way, Raven, do you know anything about that dragonborn woman?"
"No, this is the first time I’ve heard the name Rabiyen. But I’ll look into it when I get back.  The Commander might know something different."
"Okay, I’ll leave it to you."
After finishing her tea, Raven excused herself, saying she had work to do.  The three of us then began discussing who to bring from the candidates the Viscount had suggested.
The two women, who usually clashed, agreed on the first choice without any hesitation.
"I think we need a mage."
"I agree. Without a mage, there are too many inconveniences."
Filling the mage position, which was left vacant due to Raven’s unavailability.
And…
"What about the remaining spot?"
"Maybe a priest?"
A priest would be ideal for the last position.
If that doesn’t work out, a support-type esper would be a good alternative.
That was our conclusion.
I am the only tank in the team, Amelia is the melee DPS, Erwin is the ranged DPS, and a mage will join us.
A support-type esper could be a good backup for us, giving us more strength in the melee line.
It all made sense, except…
"How about this mage, this one, and this priest? And if the priest can’t come, this esper seems like a good choice!"
Erwin pointed at each name on the list of candidates we had compiled, cheerfully expressing her opinion.
And here was the problem…
"Oh, they're all men?"
It was a question about the statement she just made without thinking.
"Well… there are already too many women around you, right?"
"…"
Is it okay to choose only men for such a reason?
I glanced at Amelia, hoping for her understanding, but she just nodded instead of answering. 
As if she fully agreed.
"I think it's definitely better to choose men."
"…" "Why?"
"You can’t make proper decisions when women are involved."
What’s she on about?
I am the epitome of an iron-clad man.
Whether it was a woman or a man, I always cracked their skulls evenly when I had to kill.
The first player I killed in the Ice Cave was also a woman.
"Emily, I think you're under some kind of misunderstanding. Why are you thinking that way?"
When I asked, expressing my grievance, Amelia answered immediately, without a second thought.
"Because… it was the same for me too."
What exactly is my image to these girls?
