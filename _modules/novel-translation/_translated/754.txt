A Point Scored (4)
A masked man, his face hidden behind a wolf visage, addressed the white-haired elder.  "Sir, with your indulgence, might I ask a single question?"
The elder silently sipped his tea, then, with a seemingly casual air, replied, "Ask away."
The masked man continued, his voice low, "Why did you prevent him from going to the Sanctuary? I find your reasoning utterly incomprehensible."
"Which part eludes your understanding?" the elder inquired, his eyes twinkling with mischievous amusement behind the facade of kindly concern.
"He went to the 7th District instead," the masked man explained.  "The result?  Brown Rotmiller, a 7th-grade explorer, died.  In his place, Sven Parav became a 'Saint,' though not yet perfectly so."
The elder hummed in response.
"In effect," the masked man continued, "he lost a useless guide and gained a far more valuable comrade.  Why, sir, did you counsel him against the Sanctuary?"
"Ah, that was it…"  The elder smiled, a genuinely kind expression that belied the playful glint in his eyes.  "Telling you would spoil the fun."
"Excuse me?"
"Let's see if you can figure it out. Why do *you* think I did it?"
The masked man pondered the elder's counter-question.  After a moment, he cautiously offered, "I believe there are three possibilities."
"Tell me."
"First, you foresaw his actions."
"That he would act contrary to your advice, thus preventing him from going to the Sanctuary… Incorrect. If that were the case, why send you to offer such pointless counsel?  Left to his own devices, he would have gone there anyway."
"Yes… that's true. I did find that curious."
"And the second possibility?"
"The second… regardless of his path, Brown Rotmiller was fated to die. While this doesn't explain why you tried to send him to the 7th District… I suspect you didn't want Sven Parav to become a Saint."
"Intriguing. Continue."
"You mentioned before that Sven Parav possessed a divinely gifted soul, one capable of attracting even unbound evil gods."
"I did."
"So, perhaps you hoped Sven Parav would embrace an evil god instead. After all, a Karui priest is arguably more powerful than a Saint, and the outcome would still benefit his journey."
A pleased smile spread across the elder's face.  "I'm glad I asked for your thoughts.  A fascinating timeline indeed."
"Am I wrong again?"
"Wrong. Had he gone to the 7th District, Sven Parav would have died."
"I see…" The masked man's voice was subdued, like someone who had missed a crucial shot. "The third possibility is that Brown Rotmiller was more valuable than Sven Parav, even as a Saint…"
Even the masked man admitted this scenario seemed implausible. A retired 7th-grade guide surpassing a paladin on the verge of sainthood?
"Correct."
"What?"
"I judged Brown Rotmiller to be of far greater assistance to his journey."
The masked man was completely baffled.  Drawing on his extensive experience observing the intertwined fates of countless individuals, however, he ventured a guess.
"Sven Parav would negatively impact his journey."  He spoke with conviction.  There was no other explanation. A potential boon that proved detrimental – such paradoxical turns of fate were common.
"Incorrect again."
"What?"
The elder’s gaze shifted to the window, observing the masked man's stunned silence. "Sven Parav will contribute as much as we anticipated."
"Yet you chose Brown Rotmiller."
"Judging the future based solely on the present is foolish. Who can predict the destiny of kings and ministers?  Even a beggar can become a king; that is the nature of this world."
"So, Rotmiller possessed such talent?"
The elder chuckled, shaking his head at this simplistic dichotomy.  "He did not. But all value is determined by record." His voice held a deep undercurrent of regret. "Had Brown Rotmiller lived, he could have left a far greater legacy."
That future, however, was now lost to the world.

It felt like I had only briefly closed my eyes.  The reality of it all remained unreal.  I hadn't witnessed it firsthand; I'd only heard about it afterward.  Could they be mistaken? The hopeful thought lingered stubbornly. But…
[Be kind to Shavin. She's a good woman.]
That couldn't be true. Einar Fnellin was captured, a prisoner. Brown Rotmiller, my first guide, was dead. This was the unchanging reality. Therefore…
Clenching my fist, I pondered. What went wrong?
The 'Wolf Mask' I met before heading to the Sanctuary had told me: going to the 7th District meant A would die; going to the Sanctuary meant B would die.  I assumed A was Rotmiller.  I proceeded to the Sanctuary as planned, saving A – Rotmiller – from peril.
But…
'B was Rotmiller…?'
As a result of going to the Sanctuary, Rotmiller died. I don't blame myself for his death – I'm not that foolish.
I distinguish clearly between what I can and cannot do, and I don't berate myself for failures outside my control.  Yes, that's how it was.
…
But what is this awful feeling? The violence ingrained in this barbarian's body surged within me.  I wanted to fight, to empty my mind, to smash everything in sight.  But I restrained myself.  This barbarian body is different from Lee Han-soo's. The consequences wouldn't be limited to a broken keyboard and mouse… A wise warrior knows when to wait, for the right moment to unleash this fury…
The tent flap stirred, and Aruha Raven entered. A welcome sight, yet…
Raven froze at the entrance, her eyes meeting mine. Her face was pale, her small frame trembling like an aspen leaf. What? Had something bad happened?  The barely suppressed rage threatened to reignite when…
"I-I'm sorry," she stammered, avoiding my gaze.  "I-I'll… I'll leave you to calm down…"
She was afraid of me.
I exhaled slowly, as if expelling every toxin from my body.  I stopped her as she fumbled to leave.  "Don't go. I'm calm now."
Raven cautiously studied me, her tension easing, a sigh of relief escaping her lips.  Then…
"I heard…" she said, hesitating, offering a word of comfort.
I remained silent; I feared reigniting my inner turmoil.  But I had to ask. "Do you know what happened to Rotmiller's body?"
"I… I think you shouldn't hear…"
"Tell me. I'm calm."
"I… really think you shouldn't…"
"It's fine, I said."
Raven’s apprehensive gaze lingered on me, but she remained silent.  The answer came from outside the tent.
"Noark soldiers took his head.  If it's confirmed to be one of your comrades, it will count as a merit."
My heart pounded, a terrifyingly rapid beat.  My jaw clenched, almost painfully so.
"Could you tone down the killing intent? I'm fine, but she's nearly suffocating."
Raven trembled again, a fresh wave of panic. I forced myself to compose myself, and steered the conversation in a new direction. "What happened to you all? Where's Viviane?"
"After you disappeared with the Corpse Collector, the Orculis Commander appeared.  A battle ensued…  to put it simply, we retreated."
"What?"
"Correction.  We strategically withdrew."
She claimed they retreated to protect her, claiming they could have won a direct confrontation, but… only she knows the truth.
In short, the situation was simple. The Commander, initially searching for me, revised his target upon realizing my identity as the King's Knight. While the Commander pursued Astorotta, I escaped the Netherworld.  Astorotta, having reached the Imperial Capital, recuperated from her injuries.  Viviane was imprisoned.
"She's useless now.  I considered execution, but I spared her, just in case."
After regrouping, Astorotta searched for me, but my presence was obscured by that ancient magic. She finally came, having heard I had arrived in the Imperial Capital unconscious.
"So, tell me.  What's our next move?"
I closed my eyes briefly, considering the next steps. The decision came quickly.  "We need to rescue Einar."
"Right." Astorotta nodded. "But how?"
"I only know she was captured. We have no information on her location or if she's still alive."
Right… First, we need information.  "Astorotta, I need a favor."
"Ask."
"Even if it's just the areas within the King's reach, can you locate and gather our scattered comrades?"
"No need to ask. It's already underway."
Despite her seeming inflexibility, she's quite efficient when she needs to be.  "Let me know if you need anything, or once we've decided on our next plan."
Astorotta left.  I sat on the cot, brainstorming. I reviewed all my information, checking for omissions and relentlessly hounding Astorotta for updates every few minutes. Einar's location.  Any further news about the comrades stranded in enemy territory.  And whether the Marquis's location was still unknown.  In wartime, we had to rely on the army's intelligence network. My impatience grew with each passing moment of silence.
'Wait a minute.'
The information I desperately sought came from an unexpected source.  Thinking of the Marquis brought Ragnar to mind; Ragnar, in turn, reminded me of Hyunbyeol, his right hand.  Hyunbyeol… and the "love letter" she'd given me.
'Could it be…?'
I hurriedly retrieved the love letter, and there it was – the message.  The content was concise:
[Einar Fnellin, Alminus Central Bank, underground vault.]  (Presumed location.)
And…
[Scheduled for execution.]  (Current status.)
