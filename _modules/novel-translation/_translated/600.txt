## The Third Record (3)
How should I describe my current state? It's definitely not a "fear" or "mania" type of abnormality. But it's definitely not normal either. 
Thump!
My chest feels constricted.
"W-What! Are you planning to hit me with that?"
"Erwin, shut up. Let me think for a moment."
It feels like the filter of my consciousness has disappeared. Impulsive thoughts keep popping up, and they spill out of my mouth before I can control them.
"I'm sorry, Erwin. I didn't mean to scare you."
"N-No, I'm not scared!"
"...You're not?"
Should I apologize again? I only thought about it for a moment, but my mouth opened before I knew it. 
What could be the cause of this phenomenon?
'It must be the field effect.'
I don't know the details of the effect. However, it's highly likely that it's a mental debuff...
"Is it getting stronger over time?"
Hmm, it seems so.
When I first arrived here, I was perfectly fine. My mental state started deteriorating as time passed after we started talking at the start point. And...
"This old man was also like this, you know."
"...H-Hey, old man?"
"Oh, sorry. I was just thinking to myself."
"What are you thinking about? Why did you suddenly hit your head with your hammer? And what were you talking about just now?"
Oh, so annoying, always chattering.
"I'll tell you, so just be quiet."
I wanted to just smack him with my hammer and start, but I managed to control myself with great effort.
"Something's wrong with my head. I keep getting these strong impulses, and it's getting worse over time."
"What kind of impulses?"
"It changes every time."
"Can't you give me an example?"
"Right now, I want to smack your head."
I gave a short answer, and Erwin flinched and moved back. Then she looked like she realized something. 
"So, you hit your own head with the hammer because of that...?!"
"That's right. I thought it might make me feel better."
That method actually worked pretty well. I felt refreshed and could reflect on myself. And in that sense...
"You seem to have a similar problem, don't you?"
"...Me?"
Erwin feigned ignorance like an innocent person, but in my opinion, it was almost 100%. 
Erwin is a grumpy old woman, but she wouldn't act this out of line. Even when we had friction before, she would think rationally and apologize afterward.
"Erwin, you seem perfectly fine... Tell me. Does that old man look normal to you?"
"...No. He's weird."
"So, I'm not the only one?"
"...He has definitely become more emotional somehow."
When Erwin joined in, even Erwin couldn't help but admit it.
"It's not a problem. Not like the Baron who has the urge to hit someone, though!"
Well, that's a relief.
It's impossible to trust someone who gets angry and raises their voice like that.
"Anyway, it's clear that both of us have problems. Count, Archbishop. Are you two okay?"
I checked on their conditions afterward, but they both said that while they couldn't say they were completely normal, it wasn't something that would be noticeable externally.
"Hmm, then is it just a difference in mental strength?"
The village headman is a monster who has lived for thousands of years, and the Archbishop is a devout religious person, so it's not strange for them to have stronger mental strength than me. However...
'The intensity of the debuff could be different for each role.'
The basis for my hypothesis is Erwin. 
'Erwin, who took on the role of 'Witch,' is the only one among us who didn't receive the debuff.'
"...We need to move quickly."
Erwin interrupted my mumbling again.
"Quickly? You mean we're just going to leave this problem behind and continue our journey?"
"Yes."
There's no other way. Sitting around won't solve it, so the best thing to do is to move forward as quickly as possible.
"Unbelievable! What if someone loses their mind and attacks us from behind?"
"Don't worry. It's not like there's no solution."
I don't even need to verify it.
"Suddenly, why the hammer in the middle of our conversation...?"
Oh, that?
"You raised your voice, so I thought you might have lost your mind."
"..."
"Oh, you've gone quiet. Seems like you've come back to your senses."
"..."
The hammer can control people.
***
One day, two days, three days, four days...
We continued to descend the canyon.
Unlike the 5th floor, the Great Labyrinth, monsters of at least level 4 appeared here, but the battles themselves weren't very difficult. 
Swoosh!
Any injuries were quickly healed by the Archbishop's unlimited divine power.
Crack!
My mercenary-status strike was deadly even against high-level monsters.
Slice!
The village headman's fighting prowess, wielding brilliant aura, is needless to say. With Erwin's ancient magic and even Erwin enchanting monsters to become our minions, the battles were ridiculously easy.
Well, the battles, that is.
[Control level decreases.]
There was no conversation on our journey down the canyon, deeper into the abyss.
It was a rule implemented yesterday. 
No small talk, only conversation related to our quest.
"..."
"..."
They say that words are like seeds, don't they? 
In other words, if we don't speak, there will be no conflict.
"...How long do we have to put up with this ridiculous act?"
As with everything in life, there were dissenting voices even here.
It's not something to worry too much about, though.
"Baron! In my opinion, this is useless!"
"Tsk."
The mage, regaining his senses as soon as I raised my hammer with a frown, said, "I, I'm sorry. I got carried away by this damn curse... I'm really sorry. I won't do it again."
"I'll let it slide this time. This is your last warning."
"...I understand. I'll be careful."
Was it because I really hit him yesterday?
His eyes are starting to spark with a renewed sense of urgency. 
However, aggressive words still slipped out of my mouth.
"Don't be careful. Do it right. It's not that difficult to just shut up, is it?"
"Sir...?"
"..."
"I got carried away too. I'll shut up from now on."
Whew... This is why we banned idle talk. 
In a situation as impulsive and sensitive as this, it's best to avoid any kind of stimulation.
'I'm going crazy.'
I feel like I'm going to lose it. 
If I lose focus for even a moment, I feel aggressive.
I'm curious how the village headman and Archbishop stay so composed.
To be honest, I expected the village headman, but the Archbishop didn't seem like such a mentally strong person.
"Sir! Look, that flower!"
"My turn this time, right?"
The moment Erwin pointed to a spot, I rushed over, grabbed the flower blooming at the edge of the cliff, and popped it into my mouth.
It's simple.
[Control level slightly increases.]
This flower relieves mental abnormality symptoms when consumed. 
By the way, I was the one who discovered it. I found it everywhere I went, so I fed it to Erwin to see what would happen.
"...Sir, are you alright?"
"..."
"I appreciate your concern, but try not to talk to me. I can't take it right now."
"O-Oh, sorry."
Come to think of it, Erwin is pretty amazing too. Before I wiped out her essence, every moment was probably like this for her.
"Hey, everyone stop for a moment!"
At that moment, Erwin stopped us with a shout.
"From below! Can't you hear something from below?"
"Are you hearing voices now?"
I sighed and slightly raised my hammer, but the village headman stopped me.
"Baron, put down the hammer for now. What Sir Erwin said is true."
What? Are you serious? Did you really hear something?
I gestured to Erwin to check, but she just shook her head.
She can't hear anything either because her stats have been cut. 
"Focus. Then you'll be able to hear it too."
Following the village headman's instruction, I closed my eyes and focused on the sound. I could faintly hear a voice amidst the wind rustling past my ears.
[Come here...]
Something was whispering to me.
"Finally, something's happening."
For some, this could be a terrifying situation, but for me, it feels incredibly welcoming.
I've been through hell for days, haven't I? 
I desperately want to clear this chapter and get out of here, even for a moment.
"What should we do?"
"Obviously, we need to check what's there."
This time, even Erwin didn't object to my suggestion.
He also wants this to be over soon.
"Follow me."
As we sped up, the noise coming from below gradually became clearer.
[Good...]
[Come here...]
[You have a beautiful soul.]
I'm not happy about having to be hypnotized while listening to these blatant lines, but there's nothing I can do. 
Whether it's a mid-boss or the final boss, I need to take it down first.
"By the way, Baron..."
Someone addressed me.
"Are you thinking about worshipping something other than your ancestor's spirits?"
Surprisingly, it wasn't Erwin but the Archbishop.
I couldn't help but chuckle.
"Hee hee..."
He seemed to be holding up well, but is he finally reaching his limit?
"It's incredibly rude to try to convert a barbarian, don't you think?"
"..."
"But, considering the circumstances, you don't need an excuse. I'm not even that angry."
He's been a model grandpa who's never caused any trouble, so I was going to let it slide. 
However, despite my efforts, the Archbishop just smiled uncomfortably and stared at me. 
Because of that?
"..."
I was too late to notice the change. 
'My voice...'
I can't speak.
It's like something is blocking my throat in the middle of speaking.
I quickly checked my surroundings and quickly realized that this wasn't just a problem for me.
"..."
"..."
Everything around me is too quiet.
It's not just because of the 'no idle talk' rule.
No breathing, no footsteps. 
Even the sound of the wind that had been blowing up from below throughout the journey has vanished.
[Come here...]
Apart from the mysterious voice, there's an absolute silence.
The moment I realized this...
Woom! Woom! Woom!
I can feel a vibration starting at the tips of my feet, along with a short whisper. 
The vibration coming from below the cliff is getting stronger. 
"..."
"..."
Looking around, everyone is standing there with their mouths agape.
It seems like they're trying to say something, but I can't understand.
I went to the edge of the cliff and looked down.
Woom!
An endless darkness.
I still can't see anything.
But...
Woom!
Something soon emerged from the darkness.
It stared up at me with terrifying eyes, climbing up the cliff.
'Oh...'
My body froze like stone the moment my eyes met its.
I just can't comprehend it.
Woom!
Definitely before we arrived here.
Woom!
The mages, having thoroughly investigated the portal, confirmed that it was definitely a rift. 
[The character has entered the range of the [Silence Curse].]
[All essence skills are sealed.]
[[Giant Form] ends.]
Why is a Layer Lord appearing here?
