## Chapter 13: Second Floor (3)
A total of nine goblins charged at me. Eight were ordinary, while one was a goblin warrior.  He called himself a warrior, but carried only a 60-centimeter scimitar. Still, compared to their chisels, that was a formidable blade. 
“Grrr!”
As the goblin lunged from the front, I swiftly smashed my hammer against its temple. 
*Thwack!* 
One-shot, one-kill. The goblin vanished into a burst of light before it even hit the ground.  But it was too soon to celebrate. I’d only slain one.
“Grrrrrrr!”
Two goblins rushed me simultaneously from either side. Their chisels gleamed in their hands. I dashed to the right, shoving one aside with my shield, and instantly turned, smashing my hammer into the other. 
*Thwack!*
Two down.  But I had no time to breathe.  A goblin had already reached my rear, a warrior. 
“Kyaaack!”
It hissed like a snake, living up to its title of warrior. I froze, then rolled across the ground. 
*Whizz!*
The scimitar sliced through the air above me.  Seeing me roll, the other goblins saw their chance and pounced. 
This was why the second floor was far more dangerous than the first.  I could physically overpower four ordinary goblins, but against this number, it was impossible.  I had to be prepared for injuries. 
Or perhaps, if I were alone.
*Pwoo!*
An arrow pierced the forehead of one goblin, launched from the bushes. Erwen must have returned to her sniper position. 
*Thud!* 
I used the recoil of the roll to spring up, shield in hand, and charged into the heart of the enemy.  After all, that’s what a warrior is supposed to do, right?
“You little bastards! Come get me!”
I parried, swung my hammer, dodged, shoved with my feet, headbutted.  My barbarian blood boiled as I tore through the goblin ranks. Meanwhile, Erwen, having regained her position, unleashed a storm of arrows. 
*Whizz, phew, phew, phew!*
Every two or three seconds, arrows flew, leaving the goblins bewildered.
“Grrr, grk!”
She was a bit hasty, so her arrows didn’t always hit their mark.  But…
*Pwoo!*
They always struck, somewhere. Shoulder, arm, stomach, chest, thigh… No escape.  Sometimes, she even imbued her arrows with spirit energy, leaving them ablaze.
I kept pace with her, smashing the heads of any goblins frozen by fear, unable to react to the arrows.  
*Thwack! Thwack!*
Once only two goblins remained, they fled.  I grabbed one by the hair as it ran, and Erwen finished off the other with an arrow to the back of its head.
“You have slain a goblin warrior. EXP +1.”
As the battle concluded, Erwen emerged from the bushes and approached me. 
“Are you hurt, mister?”
“I’m fine. What about you?”
“I’m fine too.”
“Alright. Let’s collect the magic stones.”
We split up, gathering arrows and magic stones.  Despite slaying the goblin warrior, I couldn’t acquire his scimitar.  Like on the first floor, its clothing and weapon vanished into light.
“Six here.”
Including the two goblins Erwen had killed, we’d gathered eleven magic stones in total.  Considering we had found forty-four in a whole day on the first floor, this was quite a satisfactory haul.  And it all took less than two minutes.
“Here you go.”
“Two? Thank you!”
I kept nine and Erwen took two.  Although they were both 9th grade, the warrior’s stone was slightly heavier than the ordinary goblins’, so we split it accordingly. 
“Do you think we can keep this up?”
“Yes, did you find anything difficult or dangerous during this fight?”
“No, not really.”
Afterwards, I reviewed the battle, looking for ways to improve our fighting style.  We were still a bit raw, but that was to be expected. With more experience and battles under our belt, we’d only get better.
“Alright, let’s keep moving.”
“Yes!”
I checked the time one last time.
[01:31]
How much could we earn before the end of the fourth day?
***
We moved outward, expanding our range from the portal.  Beyond three kilometers, we encountered a goblin group every five minutes.  And along the way, we found ourselves facing goblin archers. 
“Kikikikiki!”
Goblin archers were a dangerous foe, with a more distinct sound than the “grrr” of the other goblins.  They used small shortbows reminiscent of a harp, and their arrows, like those of the other goblins, were tipped with poison.  They even knew how to use concealment magic. 
But…
“You have slain a goblin archer. EXP +1.”
If I focused, my barbarian body could react to incoming arrows, dodging or blocking them with my shield. Still, I had to be careful.
“There’s another goblin archer! Take it down first!”
“Yes!”
Even a barbarian could die if an arrow pierced its skull.  When I returned to the city, I’d have to buy a helmet.
“Let’s take a break.”
“Finally!”
After finishing another battle, we moved to a clearing near the portal and rested.
“You can sleep first if you want.”
“Really?”
This kid never learned the meaning of “no” apparently.  I chuckled and nodded.  She plopped down on the ground and looked up at me with the eyes of a puppy that needed to pee.
“Where are the backpack and blanket?”
“Here.”
I set down my increasingly heavy bag and retrieved the blanket, laying it over her.  Before a minute had passed, she started snoring. 
*Dororong, Dororong*
Compared to the standard barbarian style, it was soft and quiet.  
The kid must have been really tired.  She hadn’t made a sound until now.  Maybe she felt safer now than before.
[18:20]
We had been hunting through the goblin forest for about 15 hours.  We had to fight groups of more than ten goblins each time, but as we got used to it, the danger decreased and our speed increased.  As a result, we made more than we ever could have imagined on the first floor.
But there were still tense moments.
“Whew…”
As we expanded our range, we started encountering other explorers.  We’d met eleven groups in total, all with at least three members, and some teams even included members of other races.  Each encounter had us parting ways politely, but each time, I felt my energy drain. 
Explorers are scarier than goblins, especially now.  I have good reason to be wary.
“The problem is, she’s too pretty.”
I sighed, looking at Erwen, who was fast asleep.  She had been sleeping rough for days, yet her silver hair shimmered, her amber eyes drew you in, and she possessed all the features of a beauty. Lucky her, but… as an explorer? I don’t know.
We had encountered a group of explorers who licked their lips the moment they saw her.  I just hope we don’t have to worry about that happening again.
“Am I really that pretty?”
What the hell? You were snoring a minute ago.
“Sleep.”
“Yes.”
Perhaps she was still asleep because she mumbled a response before falling back into slumber.
*Drrrung, Drrrung*
What is she?  The elves I knew weren’t like this. 
***
Day 4, Day 5, Day 6…
Time flew by as we traversed the goblin forest, and before we knew it, Day 7 had arrived.  It was finally time to leave the labyrinth.
“I’m going to sleep as soon as we get back…”
“Me too.”
There was only one way to leave the labyrinth and return to the city.  We had to wait for the gate to close.  At a predetermined time, the labyrinth would eject the explorers within it back to the city.  The first floor was 168 hours, the second floor a bit longer at 240 hours.  The higher the floor, the more time you had to explore. 
But we planned to descend to the first floor before the end of Day 7 and leave the city.
“Today, we’ll stay close and not go as far as we did yesterday.”
“Yes!”
There were several reasons for leaving early.  When the first floor closed, the portal would disappear, meaning we wouldn’t have a way to retreat in an emergency.  Our food was also running low.  We could try buying supplies from other explorers in exchange for magic stones, but…
‘It wouldn’t be necessary, would it?’
More importantly, we only had about ten arrows left.  No matter how durable they were, designed for reuse, they were still consumables.  If they’d been made from Earth wood, we wouldn’t have been able to reuse them even once.  It’s strange to think we’re in another world.
[22:27]
After hunting for a while longer, I checked the time and stopped.
“Let’s go back, just in case.”
“Yes!”
We were about four kilometers from the portal.  Even at our slowest pace, it would only take about 40 minutes to reach it.  It would leave us with some extra time, but… 
It’s better to be early than late.  Plus, I have something I want to talk to her about before we part ways.
“Be careful. There’s another trap set.”
We retraced our steps, and traps had been laid down again in the forest.  The goblin groups must have respawned.  It wasn’t like a game, where they just suddenly appear out of thin air. There were often rabbit-like burrows in the forest, and the goblins always emerged from there.  So I’d waited in front of them, and even tried burning them out with Erwen’s fire magic, but there was no reaction.  I tried digging, but the ground collapsed completely, so I never got to see what was underneath. 
*Thud.*
Erwen, who was leading the way, stopped walking.
“There’s a goblin group about 70 meters to the 1 o’clock direction. Eight ordinary goblins, two warriors, and two archers.” 
She’d gotten used to it.  Now, she even briefed me perfectly, no need to ask her twice.
“Are we fighting?”
“We are.”
There was no need for a lengthy conversation.  I nodded, and as usual, Erwen led the way, pushing through the bushes, clearing a path for me.  Then she gestured for me to stop, walked ten meters ahead, took aim and drew her bowstring.
*Whizz, whizz, whizz!*
The arrow flew.
*Pwoo!*
It must have hit a goblin archer.  I’d told her to prioritize them if possible. 
“Mister!”
“Yes, you get back.”
Erwen fired another arrow into the charging goblin group, then moved back.  Our well-rehearsed baton pass.  I charged forward, swinging my hammer at the warrior standing amongst the ordinary goblins.
*Thwack!*
It felt good.  No need for a second hit. 
“Waaaaaaaack!”
I roared like a beast from the center of their formation, and the goblins faltered.  You punks, scared already?
*Thwack!*
As the goblins hesitated, I dashed forward and smashed the head of the remaining warrior.
“Grrrr!”
I’d been through so many battles that I’d become a master at this sort of brawl. And Erwen was no different.
*Whizz, phew!*
She’d already found her position.  Arrows began flying.  Our movements sometimes overlapped, and I almost got hit by an arrow, but that was happening less and less.  I’d started getting a sense of how she prioritized different targets and where to aim, depending on the situation.  Same could be said for her, I guess.
*Pwoo!*
A minute or so had passed when I smashed the head of a goblin trying to escape. I’d been told there were two goblin archers, but I didn’t see any arrows flying during the fight.  Looks like the first two arrows she fired, her surprise attack, hit both archers. 
“Good job, Erwen.”
“Heehee.”
“Still, let me know if you take down all the archers.  It’s annoying to keep worrying about them.”
“I wasn’t sure if the last one was hit.”
Well, I can understand that.  Inaccurate information could be dangerous.  She’s all grown up now, huh?  I felt a sense of pride.
“Let’s grab what we need and move on.”
“Yes!”
As I searched for magic stones, Erwen called out to me urgently.
“Mister! I found something amazing!”
I rushed over to find a fist-sized orb of light floating in the air.  I knew what it was.  I’d never seen one in person before, but…
“…A spirit core. And it’s definitely from a goblin archer.”
I was frankly speechless.  Could you get luckier than this?
“A, a, spirit core? Is, is, is this it?”
You can tell from her reaction alone that a spirit core is more valuable than treasure to an explorer.  It’s basically the skill system of *Dungeon & Stone*.
“Yes, definitely.”
“Wh, wh, what do we do?”
As I’ve said, a spirit core is precious to an explorer.  It’s basically the skill system of *Dungeon & Stone*.
“Wh, wh, what do we do?”
She’s asking the same question over and over again.  A 9:1 split, but I guess even she’s greedy for this. 
“Do you want it?”
“No, I don’t, but… if you give it to me, well…”
There’s no particular reason not to give it to her, but is it just me, or is she getting bolder?  I chuckled and spoke.
“I’ll give it to you if you make a promise.”
A goblin archer’s spirit core isn’t that appealing to me, a barbarian.  It might help me a little now, but I have a limit on how many spirit cores I can absorb.  I’d have to pay a lot to erase it later.
“Really?”
“Yes.”
I couldn’t help but chuckle as I looked at her wide eyes.  It’s still incredible to think about.  Spirit cores have an extremely low drop rate when you hunt monsters.  To get one, not from an ordinary goblin, but from a goblin archer, and on our first trip?  That’s beyond beginner’s luck.  Maybe my disastrous fate is finally starting to change. 
“I was going to tell you later when we went down to the first floor, but I’ll tell you now. Erwen—”
“Hey you two! What the hell are you doing?”
Damn it.  I thought we were getting lucky.
Just as I was about to ask Erwen for a promise, I heard a shout from afar.
“Don’t move!”
A group of four human explorers.  They had spotted us, and now were heading towards us with stern expressions.  
To be honest, I saw this coming.
“M, mister?”
This is the natural order of things.  Getting lucky?  That’s impossible.  I’ve been different from others since I was a child.  For me, good fortune is something I have to fight for, something I only get by winning. 
“Erwen, get ready to fight.”
Just like that.
