## Chapter 365: Responsibility (3)
The “Valley of the Wraith,” the gateway to the 7th Layer’s Dark Continent.  Emerging from this treacherous valley, we reached the lake where our patrol unit was stationed.  Beyond this point lay three distinct fields.
The first, the Aribeona River Mouth, was a route that followed the river cascading down into the lake.  This path offered the fastest route to the Dragon Mountain Range, the heart of the Dark Continent… 
“That’s where Bellarios emerges.” 
The Dragon Mountain Range was the place to obtain the essence that would bolster our resistance against demonic powers, a crucial element in our final training.  Of course, as a mere patrol unit, we weren’t destined to reach such heights.
Regardless, the second field was the vast jungle known as the Great Forest, sprawling east of the River Mouth.  It was so extensive, it was further divided into smaller zones, but its official name remained the Great Forest.
And lastly, the third field was the Pantelion Ruins, located west of the River Mouth.  This was our destination, where the Fourth Patrol Unit, comprising thirty members, was assigned.
“Forward, all units!” 
Upon arriving at the dilapidated ruins, the patrol unit reorganized into formation before venturing further into the field.  Of course, our unit’s primary objective was active defense against potential ambushes, so venturing deep into the ruins wasn’t part of the plan.
But…
“Advance, vanguard!” 
“Form a shield wall!”
This place was notoriously teeming with monsters.
[Krurrr…!]
There were modified beasts, their bodies forged from steel, akin to golems, alongside…
Kuuung-! Kuuung-!
Massive, magical, mechanical golems.
Whiiiiing-!
Mechanical flying monsters, buzzing like drones.
Monsters, dormant within the ruins, awoke, sensing the intrusion.  
However, the monsters couldn’t breach the shield wall, the vanguard, and reach us.
Kwaaang-!
The monsters, a massive wall of flesh and steel, were met with a human wall, an immovable barrier. 
It felt strangely unfamiliar, watching this.  I never imagined I’d see someone’s back from this perspective.
“This is what they usually see.”
A peculiar sensation washed over me, but I quickly recovered, smashing the monsters attempting to flank our formation with my hammer.
「Character has cast [Swing].」
「Giga Wolf slain. EXP +4.」
Despite being in the 7th Layer, the Pantelion Ruins' entrance was a low-level zone. None of the monsters could withstand a single blow.  Their mechanical modifications gave them a unique feel.
Kakaak, Kwah-zi-jit, Kwah-jik-!
“Whew. It’s surprisingly easy, just swinging my hammer.”
“Vanguard, move to the sides!” 
As the patrol unit’s commander commanded, the shield-bearing tanks moved in unison, opening a path through the center.  The monsters swarmed forward, but…
“Leona Er Epura!” 
Behind them, a combined magic spell had already been prepared.
Whiyong-!
A beam of light, like a laser cannon, shot from the heart of the formation, piercing through a dozen large monsters.  This disrupted the standoff, allowing us to quickly finish off the remaining monsters.
“It’s much easier hunting with a squad.  The priest’s presence provides stability for the vanguard.”
Despite the low average level, we had just taken on over a hundred monsters.  We finished them off in under ten minutes.  It was no surprise, of course.  We had over thirty members.
Even after slaying a hundred, dividing the spoils amongst us meant we didn’t gain much from this battle. 
“No essence dropped.  Let’s collect the magic stones and continue our patrol!” 
The patrol unit continued our hunt, no, our patrol, following a pre-determined route, circling the entrance of the ruins.
And…
“Man, I’ve probably gained over a hundred experience points today.”
This patrol alone saw us slay over twenty new monsters.  Although their levels were low, this field housed a variety of unique creatures.
“Well done everyone.” 
After a ten-hour patrol, we passed the shift over to the next unit and returned to our base.  The administrator handed each of us a token.  It was supposed to be proof of our contributions, accounting for today’s wages and any loot we gathered.  Apparently, we could claim our earnings later when we returned to the city, by presenting these tokens to the Office of Merit.
“Hey, friend.”
As I turned away, a man in a casual manner approached me.  I had no choice but to tilt my head in confusion.
“Who are you?” 
I had no recollection of this “friend.”  In fact, I was sure I’d never seen him before.
“What’s with that “never seen you before” look? We were right beside each other during the fight.”
Had we?  Now that I thought about it, I vaguely recalled something like that.
Experience taught me that the best course of action in such situations is to deflect the topic with a casual response.
“Ah, so what brings you here?”
I inquired about his purpose, and the unknown man, as if he were my superior, patted me on the shoulder.
“You fight pretty well, from what I saw.”
Was this some sort of attempt at socialization?  I offered a humble response.
“Fighting well?  Your standards are low.”
“What?”
The man frowned for some reason.  It wasn’t anything I needed to worry about.  As such, I gently removed his hand from my shoulder.
Thuk.
I’d been feeling uncomfortable since the beginning.  If he wanted to be friends, he should at least open his eyes.
“So, what’s your business?”
I asked again.  The man dropped his facade of a friendly smile.
And…
“I was thinking of offering some advice.”
His words surprised me.
“Advice?”
“You’re just blindly focusing on strength, aren’t you? If you keep consuming essence like that, you’ll face a grave danger someday.” 
The man pulled out a dagger and cut his forearm.
“See? Even with all your strength, you can’t cut me deeply.  An explorer needs balance, like me.  You should focus on—”
“What’s this? You’re just a cripple.”
“……?”
“Sorry, I was thinking to myself.”
Despite my gentlemanly apology, the man, with a petty expression, glared at me.  What a pathetic specimen.  He dares boast his meager Physical Resistance stat in front of me? 
“Anyways, what’s your name?”
I asked, just in case.
“Meliber Eltein.”
What?  It wasn’t Hans?
“I see.  Perhaps we’ll meet again someday.”
“Hey, what are you doing there?”
“You saw.  My escort just arrived.”
I quickly erased the name from my memory and departed.
***
Meliber… What was it again?
“What was it?”
I couldn’t recall his name properly, but thankfully, I never ran into him again.  Although I continued to take on patrol duties, I was assigned to a different unit each time.  The reason was simple.
Each patrol unit was assigned to a specific field.
It made sense, from the leadership’s perspective.  By having a single unit assigned to a specific location, they’d become familiar with the terrain and naturally develop coordination.
It was impossible to switch units so often, unless…
“Raven, the Eleventh Patrol Unit is going on a deep patrol this time… ”
“I know. I’ll write a recommendation letter for you.”
“Thanks.”
Thanks to Raven’s help, I was able to gain experience not only at the Pantelion Ruins, but also at the Aribeona River Mouth and the Great Forest.  Of course, we had only explored the entrances of each zone, and there were countless monsters I hadn’t encountered.
Still, my experience points continued to accumulate each time I switched patrol units.  And as time relentlessly passed, we finally reached the present.
「Character’s level has increased.」
「Soul Power +30.」
「Maximum Essence Capacity +1.」
I finally reached the coveted Level 7, granting me an additional Essence slot.  This meant I could add new synergy to my current build.
“The money problem is basically solved.  No need to join another expedition.  I’ll just grind essence on my next exploration.” 
Ah, but first, I need to find a ship.
As I pondered these matters, a sudden realization hit me.  The area felt unusually quiet.
“Raven.” 
“What?”
“Where did Erwen and Emily go?” 
“That woman said she was going to take a nap in the barracks.  As for Erwen…  I’m not sure.  She left shortly after that woman, and followed her.”
“Hmm, I see.” 
“So, is that all?”
Raven, ignoring me, was already engrossed in reading documents.  Could she at least give me time to speak?
“She’s the only one around now.”
This was a new sensation.  Usually, when I met with Raven, Amelia or Erwen would be by her side.
“This is a good chance to ask her about it.” 
“Raven.” 
“What?”
“That… ‘event’ you mentioned.  What was it?”
I cautiously inquired.  Raven’s pen faltered, stopping mid-stroke.  She looked at me with a fleeting glance.
“Event?”
She pretended not to understand.
“You said it yourself, outside the cage.  You said after entering the Mage Tower, ‘that event’ had happened soon after… ”
“I don’t really want to talk about it.  It’s not important.”
“Oh, is that so?  Well, I guess I can’t force you.”
Even though I usually act like a barbarian, I had no intention of being rude to her.  So, I dropped my curiosity.
And…
“So, how is your mother?  Is she doing well?”
I decided to make small talk.  It was a sensitive topic, but I wasn’t entirely uninvolved.
“Did… did you know something?”
Raven stuttered, her response tinged with unusual suspicion.  I tilted my head in confusion.
“What?”
“Nothing.  But… Mother…  Why?  You don’t seem like someone who would be curious about that.”
Ah, I see.  Trying to draw a line, huh?
“Why wouldn’t I be curious?  I was the one who convinced your mother to send you to the Mage Tower.”
My blunt statement startled Raven.
“…………What… what are you talking about?”
“I’m not sure if you remember, but you came to the library after getting a beating from your mom. You were crying like a baby and begged me for help—”
“I… I never did that!!”
“What?  You said you barely remember that time.”
“Even so, I’m… I’m sure I didn’t do that.”
“Oh, is that so?”
“I don’t feel that way, so stop joking around.  Is that true?  Did you really… convince my mother?”
“Yes.”
I decided to press on, recounting the events of the past.  I had glossed over certain details when we were in the cage.  There was a part of me that wanted to have this kind of conversation with her.  Or rather, I wanted to know how my presence had positively affected the cause and effect.
Who knows?  Maybe someday, I’ll have to use the ‘Shard of Recorded Memory’ again.
“I don’t want to hear that story.”
However, I omitted certain portions of my conversation with her mother.  The reason for this was quite simple.
[That child will abandon me.]
[Someday, she’ll become a great person and look down on me.  He’ll leave for his own world.  Like the man from that day, the man who was like him, she is his blood…]
[Something’s wrong.  Why does that child have such an easy life?  He was born from my womb, but I have never met anyone who helped me for such a reason.  But… but why does she…]
How could I possibly recount such a dark story?
Especially to she, in person.
“I don’t need to hear about the library anymore.  Just tell me, what did you talk to my mother about that day?”
“It’s nothing special.  I convinced her to send you to the Mage Tower, telling her I’d cover all the costs.  And she refused.” 
“Refused…?”
“Well, to be more precise, she refused the money.  They say someone from the Mage Tower visited her a few days ago.  Apparently, they’d noticed you using magic everywhere at such a young age.”
“I see… So that’s why my mother changed her mind suddenly…”
“Ahem, I’m not going to say it outright, but in a way, I’m your benefactor…”
I subtly implied this point, but Raven simply ignored me, offering no response. 
“I guess I’m just not the type of person to want to talk about it.”
That was cold.
“So… how did your mother end up?  Are you two getting along now?”
I changed the topic.  This was a sensitive subject as well, but I wasn’t entirely uninvolved.
“Even if I wanted to, I can’t.”
“What?”
“She’s dead.”
My words caught in my throat, and a heavy silence fell.
“Oh… um… yeah?  I’m sorry to hear that.  I never noticed anything wrong with her health… ”
I was so taken aback that I even stuttered.  I tried to smooth things over, but the damage was done.
“It wasn’t a health issue.  Nor an accident.  And it wasn’t natural causes either.”
“Then?”
“She hanged herself.”
“…”
“It was about a month after she sent me to the Mage Tower.  I had to go home for a week because of an assignment my teacher gave me…”
Raven spoke nonchalantly, like someone reading an old diary hidden in a corner of the warehouse.
“Her room smelled rotten.  That’s my last memory of her.”
“…”
“Don’t make that face. It’s all been settled ages ago.  What’s so shocking about someone dying?”
Raven even tried to comfort me, seeing my awkwardness.  But I couldn’t find words.  Those memories just flooded my mind.
[Isn’t it strange?  A room in this wretched place is all I’ve ever worked for.] 
The last conversation I had with my mother.
And after that conversation…
[What was my life even about?]
Her figure, stumbling into a back alley, a frail woman resembling a person on the verge of death.
