Looking back, I was a truly ridiculous person. While I constantly found life tedious, I never once contemplated suicide. The feeling of boredom was ultimately just an emotion, and life was something precious to me. It simply didn't add up, at least in my mind. And that thought persists even now. Which is why...
I was crawling through the darkness on three limbs. It might sound nonsensical, but I meant it literally. My right foot was a mangled mess, dragging behind me as I crawled on all fours. Anyone who saw me then would undoubtedly think I was a stray dog with a broken leg. How did I know? Because that's what I was thinking at that moment.
The price of relinquishing my human dignity was sweet. I wasn't in pain because I didn't have to use my injured foot, and I moved faster than I had before. Most importantly, there was no chance of stepping on another trap. My elbows and knees ached, but that was nothing... I could endure it. I could withstand it. What wouldn't I do to survive? I could even eat dog shit with a smile. Well... maybe, if I had some time to mentally prepare.
"I wonder what happened to that guy?"
He was just a label I applied. I didn't know his gender, age, or name. It was just a guess based on his tone. I had this gut feeling he was a white guy in his 30s wearing glasses. Or maybe not.
"[Bleeding] is continuing."
Anyway, what had happened to that guy who had awakened in the body of Orum, the son of Cadua? Was he dead? Or had he returned to his own body? It was a question that had lingered in my mind since I opened my eyes. Even when I deliberately tried not to think about him, he kept popping up in my thoughts, especially when things got worse.
"[Bleeding] is continuing."
I started to understand why people believed in religion. Reality was too harsh to navigate alone. When despair arrived, you needed a place to turn your gaze, just like me now.
"[Bleeding] is continuing."
"[Bleeding] is continuing."
"Warning: Character's life force is below 5%. Seek immediate treatment or the character may die."
Whew, I had been crawling without paying attention and I had come quite a distance. Though it was a subtle difference, I could sense the surroundings gradually getting brighter. This was a positive development in many ways. At least I was heading in the right direction, and my hypothesis that the entire first floor wouldn't be this dark proved to be correct. I just had to reach a brighter place. There would be people there. I'd give them this gemstone and ask for help. Then somehow...
"Cut the crap, you're delusional."
I was trying to reassure myself with positive thoughts, but another part of me emerged.
"You idiot, why would they help you? You're offering them a measly piece of bread? They'll just steal your gemstone and shield and kill you."
Was it because it was me? This other guy was actually smart.
"What if you run into a goblin first, not a human? Don't you have a brain? Huh?"
I couldn't take any more insults as the main consciousness.
"What the hell are you supposed to do then, you moron? You still have to go. At least you can see there. Even if a goblin pops out, it's better than fighting here, wouldn't you say?"
"I... suppose so."
The other me conceded, and my mind fell silent again. I continued to crawl.
"Kuh-huh-huh...," I chuckled.
I felt like I was going insane. Or maybe I already had. After all, I had lost this much blood. It felt like my consciousness kept splitting in two, merging again, and then growing numb in a cycle. It was a kind of virtuous circle. If I went any further numb, I wouldn't wake up again for sure.
"Huh-huh-huh...," I let out a laugh.
I didn't have the energy for it, but I laughed anyway. Before I knew it, the surroundings were bright. I saw a crystal shimmering at the end of the tunnel. More importantly, I saw a human figure standing in front of it, bathed in backlight. I wasn't mistaking a goblin for a human. It was definitely a human figure.
"He...lp...," I wanted to shout, but I couldn't get the words out.
I crawled desperately, closing and opening my eyes. And wouldn't you know it? The human figure was closer. It was like they had teleported. I was so startled that I closed and opened my eyes again.
"[Bleeding] is continuing."
They were even closer this time. Five or six people were standing in front of me. I couldn't be seeing things, could I? I closed and opened my eyes again.
"Achievement Unlocked."
Condition: Life force falls below 2%.
Reward: Mental value permanently increases by +1.
Then I saw a blonde man kneeling. He was looking at me and his surroundings with a strange gaze, but he didn't ask me anything. He was more inclined to make his own judgment based on his experience and intuition. Being a veteran, he quickly reached a conclusion.
"You're a newbie, aren't you?"
Damn it, then help me, you prick. I'm just a pathetic Barbarian with a shield, and all I have left is this goblin gemstone I traded for a leg. If you want, I'll give you everything. So please...
"Suspicious. How did a newbie get here before us?"
I tried to speak quickly, but the sound that came out was closer to a cough.
"Grrr...," I groaned.
To be honest, it sounded more like a goblin than a human, but it was enough to convey that I was unable to speak.
The blonde man turned to his companion and asked, "Sister Elsina, would you perhaps be willing to treat this individual?"
Elsina? Sister Elsina? Does this party have a cleric? I looked to my side with the eyes of a creature who had found salvation. And there she was, a red-haired cleric in a white robe. She met my gaze and responded with a firm voice, her lips forming precise words.
"I decline."
What? What did she say?
"Understood. I see."
Why the hell are you agreeing?
I was heartbroken. Why the hell was I dragged here and treated like this? As my anger boiled over, she spoke.
"Partslan, would you mind handing over a potion?"
"It's a precaution for when I can't use my divine power."
"You have plenty, anyway. I'll pay you later."
"Tsk."
A man with a sword strapped to his waist finally reacted. He clicked his tongue, pulled out a potion from his bag, and threw it at me. My heart sank as if this was my life.
Thud.
Thankfully, the blonde man caught the potion.
"It's not divine power, so it'll hurt a bit."
He opened the potion and sprinkled half of it over the wound and poured the other half directly into my mouth. Soon after, I felt an unbearable pain. Was this what it felt like to have all the pain that had accumulated in my body while I was unconscious suddenly hit me?
"[Recovery (in progress)] effect is rapidly regenerating the body."
My whole body felt like it was melting away. That was why potions couldn't be used during combat in the game. I thought it was just a system restriction, but now I realize it was a remarkably accurate reflection of reality. Damn it.
"Ugh, ugh, ugh...," I gasped for breath.
A few minutes passed. The pain gradually subsided, and I regained consciousness.
"Alright, Barbarian. Tell us. How did you, a newbie, reach this location before us? If you know of a new passage, we'd like to buy the information."
Was that their purpose?
I didn't mind. In fact, I was relieved knowing they had a purpose for treating me well. Nothing was more ominous than unjustified kindness. Still, I felt a pang of guilt. I didn't know of any secret passages.
"... I was in this location as soon as I entered the labyrinth."
I told them the truth, simply and honestly.
The blonde man tilted his head, but then nodded as if he understood something.
"Indeed... I've read about it. Sometimes, due to dimensional instability, such cases can occur."
My heart pounded. I questioned him as if I hadn't heard correctly.
"You've... never seen this before?"
I couldn't believe it. After all, this party had a cleric and a mage. It meant they were genuine individuals who operated at the middle levels or higher. And yet, they claimed they had never seen this before?
"Yes, the book says that it happens once in a hundred years, if you're lucky. To be thrown this far out to the fringes..."
Oh, I see. So it's a once-in-a-hundred-year event, and I experienced it the moment I entered the labyrinth. Now I understand why the other Barbarians didn't carry torches. You wouldn't worry about getting struck by lightning just because it rains, would you?
"Seeing as you're a first-timer, experiencing such a rare event... that must have been quite the disaster, huh?"
The blonde man looked at me with a hint of pity.
"It wasn't the information we were hoping for, but it's an interesting story nonetheless. Forget about the potion's price, head out."
He was a bit of a jerk, but fundamentally a good guy, I guess.
"Oh, and take that shield that fell over there."
He pointed to a shield lying on the ground. It was about 20 meters away. I must have been so focused on keeping it strapped to my waist that it slipped off.
"We'll be on our way then."
They left without waiting for my thanks. Time was money in the labyrinth, so I couldn't blame them. In fact, it was a miracle they even spared this much time for me.
I watched them leave for a while, then rushed over to pick up the shield. I was definitely happy to be alive... but something still felt strange.

"That Barbarian is lucky, huh?"
"Well, it's a bit ambiguous to say he's lucky. Experiencing something like that on his first run...," the blonde man chuckled vaguely.
The swordsman scoffed, "If he's the kind of guy who steps on goblin traps, he would have ended up the same way even without that. Meeting us is where his luck comes in."
"To be precise, it's not us but meeting Drows, right? You were reluctant to even use a potion," the female archer chimed in.
The swordsman shrugged, "Well, those kinds of guys are dime a dozen. They won't survive long anyway. Our cleric probably feels the same way, right?"
The cleric smiled wryly, but didn't respond. The archer spoke for her, "Sister Elsina would have healed him if not for the temple's rules. Or maybe she would have broken the rules herself if there were no potions. You think everyone is like you?"
"Well, who knows? I've seen so many people with two faces."
"...Partslan, you need to learn a little from Drows."
"Like being considerate enough to ask if he knows of a secret passage?"
"Yeah. Barbarians aren't known for being fond of help from others. That's why he was so thoughtful."
"...Uh, you're making me sound a little too good, aren't you?"
The blonde man scratched his head awkwardly, feeling a little uncomfortable with the attention being directed at him. But he didn't deny the word "considerate."
"Ah, to take the shortcut, we need to turn here."
"It's convenient to have a guide in the party."
"Sister Elsina! Guides usually only know the direction to the portal. Drows is simply amazing. He memorized the entire layout of the first floor."
The swordsman shook his head, looking at the archer, "But where the hell does that trail of blood go? We've walked quite a distance, haven't we?"
"Well, seeing him crawl that distance on his own is enough to say you're wrong about him being lucky."
"Ugh, come on, it's not a big deal... It'll lead to somewhere around here."
They followed the trail of blood until they reached the shortcut. After another 15 minutes, they arrived at their destination.
"This route seems to be the fastest for us. Our rush was worth it. Let's activate it."
The blonde man placed his hand on the tombstone at the end of the dead-end path. A burst of intense light erupted, taking the form of a sphere. It was the portal to the second floor.
"Hold on."
Just as they were about to jump into the portal, the female archer stopped them.
"That... isn't that what the Barbarian was wearing?"
"What?"
They all turned to look at where she pointed, and they were all speechless for a moment.
The darkness revealed by the light from the portal showed a bloodstained trap and a lone, unidentified sandal.
"...I think you're right."
The mage smiled intriguingly and created another sphere of light, moving it to the other side of the passage.
Whoooooosh!
The trail of blood, starting from the trap, stretched along the curved passageway. The light sphere couldn't reach the end, even when they tried to move it.
A silence fell over them.
"...Drows, how long would it take to reach where he was from here?"
"...Assuming we don't take any shortcuts, about 15 kilometers."
"Heh-heh-heh, what a beastly physique. Crawling that far on his own in this darkness."
The mage just chuckled in amazement. The swordsman, however, couldn't help but react.
"...He's crazy."
He felt this wasn't a matter of physical strength but of mental resilience. He thought back, "Would I be able to crawl for hours on end if I were in that situation? Without even being sure if I'd meet someone who could help me?"
He didn't know.
But one thing was for sure, the Barbarian was crawling when they first found him. He kept moving his arms and legs as if he were unconscious. What happened next? He raised his hand without even being able to speak properly. In his hand was a small gemstone. He hadn't thought much of it then, but now he realized what it meant.
"He was asking for help by offering this."
Because that was the only thing he had left to give. That was why he held the gemstone tightly in his hand as he crawled that long distance. In case he met anyone, he could show it right away.
The swordsman finally reached a conclusion, "...I have to retract what I said earlier."
He was just lucky? That kind of guy is bound to die soon? No way. He knew from long experience.
"Drows, what was that Barbarian's name?"
Those kind of crazy bastards don't die easily, no matter how difficult and despairing the situation is. They never resort to death as an escape.
