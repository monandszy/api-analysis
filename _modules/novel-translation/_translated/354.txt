## Chapter 354: Isolation (1)
The lakeshore where the garrison was stationed was one of the few safe havens in the Dark Continent. The monsters did not spawn naturally here, but it didn't signify absolute safety. After all, the dangers in the Labyrinth weren't limited to monsters alone. 
*Beep-beep-beep!*
A magical alarm, like an emergency siren, blared, signaling the detection of an enemy. Their identity was obvious. While a stray monster might wander in, it wouldn't unleash a barrage of magic projectiles. 
"Noir!"
"They're attacking!"
Another problem arose. The enemy was identified, but how did they reach this far? The main force had surely searched meticulously during their advance. 
*The main force wouldn't have been defeated.*
That was the initial assumption. After all, how many soldiers were in the main force? It was inconceivable that such a large army would be wiped out in such a short span. If they were in dire straits, they would have sent a message. And if they had, the 3rd Legion, which we belonged to, would have immediately dispatched reinforcements. Therefore…
*They must have bypassed the main force and attacked this place directly.*
This was the most plausible scenario. If this assumption was correct, the attacking force would likely be small. It made sense to move with a small, elite group to bypass the main force. 
Of course, I wasn't entirely sure how things would actually turn out…
"Sir... What are you doing?! Go out quickly!"
It was Rihen, as usual. Should I even bother correcting Raven's misunderstanding?
"Right, let's go."
After a brief moment of mental organization, I hurried outside the barracks. At that instant…
"Oh, oh...!"
I saw a magical projectile made of pure magic hurtling towards us. Good thing I decided to take the lead.
*Kaboom!*
The magical projectile exploded on impact with my shield, showering us with magical remnants. The shockwave was considerable, but it wasn't enough to knock me off my feet. My Guardian Legion Badge absorbed 50% of the force.
"A, are you alright?"
What a scaredy-cat. 
Maybe it was because the magic unit was always positioned in the rear?
"I'm fine."
I reassured Raven's aide, who was shaken by the magic projectile that exploded right in front of us, and swiftly issued commands.
"Alex, right? Stick close behind me."
"Y, yes!"
"Emily, Erwen, you two stay behind and protect this man."
"Yes!"
Our formation was quickly established. 
Normally, this would be Alex's responsibility, as the leader of our squad…
Well, he seemed like the type who just followed orders. He didn't appear to be resentful that I was giving orders.
"Alex, where are the Deputy Commander's quarters?"
"O, over there!"
"Then let's head that way first. Keep up."
"Yes!"
As other explorers rushed out of the barracks, grouping together by their squads, we moved towards the inner part of the garrison.
Our squad's primary objective was protecting important figures…
…But honestly, it was an excuse. My real intention was to get closer to the command post to gather more information about the current situation.
*What if Raven is in danger?*
With renewed urgency, we reached Raven's barracks. He was standing in front of the quarters, surrounded by a throng of mages from the Magic Legion. They seemed to be engaged in some kind of ritual, drawing a magic circle on the ground.
"Deputy Commander Raven, what exactly is happening?"
I rushed forward to ask, but Raven frowned.
"Why are you here... ?"
"We are here to carry out our assigned duties during an emergency."
"Ah... ."
Raven nodded in understanding. 
It seemed she had remembered that I had changed our squad's duty to guarding him.
However, there was still one thing that seemed to bother him.
"Assistant Commander Alex Halo, why is this man reporting instead of you? Aren't you the leader of this squad?"
Raven glared, causing Alex to freeze in his place, unable to hide his confusion.
"Well, I, I was just thinking…"
It was as if he had just realized I was naturally leading the group.
It wasn't much of a reason for leniency.
"Thinking… ?"
"No, I… I’ll correct it!"
"Correct what?  Haa, never mind. We don't have time for this."
"Deputy Commander, your magic charging is complete!"
A mage's announcement brought Raven's conversation to an end. He walked towards them.
And…
*Arua Raven casts the 2nd-tier defensive magic, [Golden Wall].*
A giant wall of steel enveloped the entire lakeshore in the form of a dome.
***
To be honest, I was speechless. 
*Wow, she's using 2nd-tier magic now?*
The 2nd-tier defensive magic, Golden Wall. 
Dozens of mages had poured their magic into the spell, but Raven was the one who cast it at its core. In other words, she had grown to the point where she could cast 2nd-tier magic, as long as she had enough magic.
*This is strange...*
The Deputy Commander of the Magic Legion. 
She even earned the moniker "Gold Mage." I had expected her to be strong, but…
Will I be able to bring her back as a comrade?
As the Deputy Commander of a legion, she could have a prosperous career without ever having to be an explorer again.
"At least we bought some time with this. Everyone, good job."
"Yes, Deputy Commander!"
"Let's follow her."
Raven walked forward with a commanding aura, and the legion mages followed her.
I quickly increased my pace to get next to Raven.
"Where are we heading right now?"
I was worried, but thankfully Raven glanced at me, then replied with an annoyed expression.
“…We got a message from the 3rd Legion’s command post. We’re supposed to activate the defensive magic and then rendezvous with the central headquarters. If you’ve had your fill of questions, stop asking. I’ve got a lot on my mind.”
I understood the annoyance of interruptions while thinking. So I shut up and followed.
We arrived at the central headquarters soon after. Raven went inside alone.
I was about to follow her, but…
“…Why are you following me?"
"Our squad’s duty is to escort you—"
"Stop talking nonsense and stay outside. It's an order.”
Raven’s rigid, resolute tone forced me to back down.
Man, I wanted to eavesdrop on the conversation between the higher-ups. 
Maybe there was a way…
I asked Erwen and Amelia, but even they didn’t seem to have any ideas.
After a long wait…
“Deputy Commander!”
About 30 minutes later, Raven emerged from the headquarters.
I quickly approached her, asking what had happened, but she gave me a cold reply, saying she couldn’t tell me.
*Man, she really gives the cold shoulder to people she’s not close to.*
I miss the old Raven. 
She would always make a disgusted face, but then actually fulfill any request I made…
"Emily, can you investigate a bit?"
"I was already planning to."
Information was more valuable than gold in this situation, so I had Amelia gather intelligence. 
She had a lot of experience with this kind of thing. So it didn’t take long.
“First, communication with the main force has been cut off.”
"That means we can’t get any support from them?"
"Well, not necessarily. They usually contact us at set intervals. If the communication breaks down, they’ll know something happened here."
"Then our main concern is whether we can hold out until the main force returns."
The main force had departed almost 10 hours ago.
Even if they turned back immediately because of the communication breakdown, it would take a significant amount of time to return.
"What about the explorers’ reactions?"
"They're not too bad. They tend to trust the Gold Mage. The general sentiment is that everything will be fine, like last time."
"Last time?"
“Ah, I know that!”
Erwen jumped in on the conversation, seizing the opportunity.
It seemed there was one previous attack on the garrison.
It happened during the early days when everyone was still unfamiliar with each other.
“That time, she also activated a magic circle she’d set up beforehand and summoned this wall. Even Noir tried to break through for hours, but they ultimately failed and fled.”
This incident was how Raven earned the moniker “Gold Mage.” Afterwards, Noir realized that Raven was always guarding the garrison and never attempted anything similar again.
Until today.
"Something feels off."
"Definitely…"
Amelia agreed with my mumbling, but Erwen tilted her head in confusion.
"Off? What do you mean?"
"Well, didn’t they fail once and vow to never make the same mistake again?"
If they were employing the same strategy after failing once, they must have prepared a way to break through.
Noir wasn’t a bunch of idiots.
They were the ones who prepared a large-scale explosion spell, anticipating that their main forces would escape through a dimensional gate. Now they were just trying to poke at us?
That made no sense.
*The real question is how they plan to break through this…*
I pondered the “Golden Wall” magic.
It was a high-level spell that required mastery in earth and lightning magic.
The defining characteristic was…
*First, it's not a channeling skill.*
Unlike other spells that need continuous mana input to sustain their physical form, this spell’s duration is determined by the initial mana input.
*It can also be repaired by adding more magic if it gets damaged.*
Now I understood why the explorers weren’t that pessimistic about the situation.
After all, they had a whole magic legion assembled.
If the wall breaks, they could just fix it. And not only repair it, they could probably reactivate the spell at least twice. 
But…
*This doesn’t feel like the end of the story.*
I had just met Hans.
Assuming the other side had some kind of secret weapon, I wracked my brains.
“Sir…?”
“Leave me alone. I’m trying to think.”
How were they planning to break through this wall?
Did they bring a high-level mage like the Doombringer?
No, wait a minute.
*…Do they even need to break through?*
If I were them, I wouldn’t just fire magic projectiles from afar. I would close the distance and force a melee.
But they didn’t do that.
They launched long-range attacks from afar and gave us time to cast the “Golden Wall.”
It was almost as if they were waiting for that exact moment.
*So they wanted us to use the Golden Wall.*
Why?
The answer came to me as I considered it from the enemy's perspective.
"They already snuck inside."
There was nothing easier than taking down a complacent enemy from within.
Did they not understand what I was saying?
“…What do you mean?”
Instead of answering Amelia, I looked at the Golden Wall that enveloped the lakeshore and asked.
"Do you happen to know how long that wall lasted before?"
“Eight hours… I think. It stayed up long after the main force arrived.”
Right, that’s it.
*Eight hours…?*
That was the amount of time we’d be trapped inside this wall.
***
The moment I saw Noir’s plan in my mind, I went straight to Raven’s quarters.
"I have something to tell you."
“You were supposed to wait outside the quarters. Did that woman tell you to copy her rudeness?"
Raven frowned, but this wasn’t the first time I saw him like this.
I ignored his expression and conveyed all the information I wanted to share.
At first, Raven was confused about the situation. But as I continued, his expression changed.
“Why Noir kept trying to do something that was clearly pointless. That was something we were all curious about. And what you said makes sense. I’ll organize this opinion and immediately convey it to the higher-ups—"
"Conveying it is not enough. We need to come up with a countermeasure right away."
“…I’ll take care of it. So now go.”
I was firm and resolute, cutting him off. But unfortunately, it didn’t work.
Damn, I guess it’s because I’m not speaking like a Barbarian.
"It doesn’t seem to be working."
“I guess I can only hope Raven will convey it properly.”
I left the quarters, stood outside and watched the time pass.
*Fwooosh!*
Suddenly, something dark and murky arced through the air and landed in front of us. 
Slowly, it rose to its feet.
*[Grrrraaaawwww!] *
It was a corpse with slimy skin.
