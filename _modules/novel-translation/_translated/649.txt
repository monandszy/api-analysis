## Barbarian Business (2)
After concluding my conversation with the Clan Head, I decided to visit the dwarven fellow after a long time.
"Hiku로드 무라드."
"비요르으으으은! Why now...? Why have you only come now...? I've written you several letters...!"
The dwarven fellow's reaction was more intense than ever upon our reunion.  It's no wonder; his forge wasn't spared from the recent chaos, and he'd become unemployed.
That's why we're meeting in the Commel비 여관 lobby, a place he never expected to visit.
"I'm sorry. I meant to come earlier, but I was busy."
"Busy? You've been back for over a month!"
"Yeah, I was really busy."
"..."
Honestly, I could have visited whenever I wanted, but I kept putting it off, day after day, until now.
'It seems he managed to preserve most of his assets, including the Mysti움 I entrusted to him.'
It wasn't such a dire situation, was it? 
According to the contents of his letters, the moment things went south, he managed to secure all the important assets and flee to safety amidst the turmoil.
Well, he still lost the forge, though.
"So, Hiku로드, how are you doing now?"
"Hmm... I'm keeping a close eye on things for now. I thought about pooling my resources to restore the forge... But, as you know, there's no way a forge will be profitable in this current situation.  So, I'm considering starting anew in Commel비..."
"And?"
"Recently, the average monthly rent in every district, including Commel비, has skyrocketed.  It seems a lot of people are having the same idea.  A contractor I know mentioned that the number of explorers trying to open shops is increasing drastically."
Oh, this is information I wasn't aware of.
Could it be because the people of District 7 and District 13 are moving to other districts, coupled with the bad news of the Labyrinth's closure?
'…And those noble bastards who own the land must be desperate for cash.'
They say that during times of upheaval, it's the commoners who suffer the most.
That's exactly right.
"So, before I make any decisions, I wanted to hear your thoughts... Do you happen to know what will become of this situation?"
... Come to think of it, was the dwarven fellow always this short?
His subtly inquisitive tone was as if he were asking a stock market expert for good news.
I guess he thought, since I'm a noble, I must know something.
"I don't know when this situation will end."
"Hmm... I see..."
"But if you're planning to open another forge, set it up in District 7 as soon as possible."
"Why?"
"Reconstruction will begin soon. Even if you just make rebar and shovels and supply them, you'll make back your investment.  Maybe I can even throw some work your way."
When I informed him that I'd be participating in a bidding war to be the main contractor representing Mel베스, the dwarven fellow's expression changed.
Of course he knows.
No matter the world, businesses connected to the 'government' are lucrative.
"Ah! In that case, I have to hurry! Just trust me! I'll do my best!"
"Ah, don't rush into anything just yet."
"What...? Why shouldn't I hurry?"
Seeing the dwarven fellow tilt his head in confusion, I took the opportunity to explain the concept of '전세'.
"What? There's a way to rent a place for free without paying monthly rent?!"
"Yes. If you purchase the land within a short period of time, you can enter into a contract using that method I told you about.  So, until then, focus on figuring out how you want to build your forge."
With that, I patted the dwarven fellow's shoulder, comforting him after his recent troubles.  Tears welled up in his eyes.
"비요른... You've always been good to me, but this is too much... Thank you! Thank you so much!"
… People in this world are so naive.

The conversation with the dwarven fellow continued for a while.
Although he's a businessman now, he still had a knack for exploration from his past days. He asked me various things about the exploration of the First Floor.
Ah, maybe this is something everyone in this city would be curious about, not just people who were explorers in the past?
Anyway.
"On the First Floor, there's a silver sea. And on it floats the items that were abandoned when the Labyrinth was closed."
As the dwarven fellow had a rather loose tongue, I avoided any sensitive information and focused on the less important details.
However…
"A silver sea... My friend would have loved to see it."
"He would have liked it even if it wasn't the sea.  He was so curious about everything."
"That's right..."
At some point, the dwarven fellow's eyes, which had been bright with interest as he listened to my stories, dimmed.
He stared blankly at something, like a drunkard recalling his youth over a drink.
"비요른, what do you think?"
"What do I think about what?"
"If… if things had been different back then, do you think I would have continued exploring?"
His voice was filled with deep regret and longing.
I hesitated for a moment, unsure how to respond, but I quickly gathered myself and replied playfully.
"Well, it's possible, but even then, you wouldn't have explored with me."
"... What?"
"I'm not the kind of person who would drag a lagging teammate along. I'm not that soft-hearted."
My words made the dwarven fellow chuckle.
"A lagging teammate... I can't argue with that, looking at you now. I wouldn't have been able to keep up.  Unless it was my friend."
"Well, to be honest, 드왈키 was more capable than you, but..."
"Haha, is that so? Anyway, either way, we would have followed you."
"No, what are you listening to?  I had absolutely no intention of taking you along."
"My friend is joking. You're not the kind of person who would abandon your companions."
Don't make me laugh.
In reality, I was about to disband Team Half-Penny right before that incident.
That's why I regretted it so much later.
I should have made that decision sooner.
"..."
After a moment of silence, the dwarven fellow brought up a new topic.
"Even though the forge was completely destroyed, it feels kind of liberating."
"Liberating? You're not having a headache, are you?"
"Hea 
dache?  I just meant that it feels like my friend is pushing me forward.  He's telling me to let go of the past and move on..."
His words made me momentarily thoughtful.
Come to think of it, the forge he used to run.
'It was originally 드왈키's house, remodeled...'
The dwarven fellow then spoke about his aspirations, mentioning how he'd build a new forge, bigger and equipped with the latest technology.
How much time passed?
"I don't know why I always end up talking so much when I see you.  I apologize.  But can I ask you one more thing?"
"Of course."
"My friend... how do you think he would feel if he saw me now?"
"..."
"A businessman... not an explorer, not a blacksmith...  Do you think he'd think I'm pathetic?"
His trembling voice held this question, and I couldn't help but chuckle.
It's a little awkward to do this in the midst of a serious conversation.
"He would definitely think you're pathetic."
"... You think so too...?"
"If he saw you worrying about such pointless things."
Honestly, what kind of nonsense are you spewing after all this time?  It's been a while, so I decided to wrap up our conversation.
I stood up, saying,
"Ah, by the way, this is something that hasn't been made public yet."
I leaned in to the dwarven fellow's ear and whispered,
"The Dragon Slayer, 리갈 바고스."
"!"
The dwarven fellow flinched as if his trauma had resurfaced upon hearing that name.
His reaction wiped away any lingering hesitation.
"Don't worry about him anymore."
Secrets are best kept to a minimum, but...
This guy deserves to know.
"He's not in this world anymore."
It might have been a wish he kept bottled up inside, afraid to burden me with it.
But now that wish is fulfilled.
"I see..."
Despite my words, the dwarven fellow remained silent.
He didn't ask:
Why?
How did you know?
Did you do it?
Not a single word.
As if he understood my situation.
After a long silence, the only word he managed to utter was,
"... Thank you."
With that, I turned away awkwardly.
"... You're welcome."
There are still many people who need to be paid back.
***
As expected, it didn't take long for the Clan Head to contact me.
Four days?
Honestly, it's safe to say that I only took a couple of days to go home and wrap up my thoughts before calling him.
'He said he'd start looking for nobles willing to sell their land, so I can just leave that part to him...'
After he contacted me, I scheduled a meeting with Count Almi너스.
"A truly brilliant idea.  샤빈 에무어, was it?  Why did it take so long for me to learn about such a talent?"
Well, he's coveting our Chief Administrator.
After a friendly laugh and a quick photo, the Count offered his advice on the '전세' contract method and its clauses, which I had devised.
And…
"It would be great if those clauses you mentioned are included in the contract. I'll treat the 'deposit' you mentioned as 'collateral' and give it the same treatment as our existing collateral loan products."
He gave me the answer to the purpose of my visit today.
To be honest, I felt a little uneasy.
I felt anxious for no reason, as things were going much smoother than I expected.
I tried to probe around, but to my surprise, Count Almi너스 was completely transparent with his answers.
"You ask if the business will be successful... Honestly, it's fifty-fifty right now.  It's a business that can be done in these times, but it's also true that nothing can be guaranteed in times like these."
"Hmm..."
"The potential reward is great, but if it fails, the losses will be significant.  Currently, our House Almi너스 doesn't have the resources to invest in such a risky venture."
Of course, I couldn't fully grasp the situation based on that alone.
"Then why would you even consider approving a collateral loan?"
The fact that Almi너스 Bank would approve a collateral loan.
Honestly, that alone meant that Count Almi너스 was taking on the same level of risk as me.
So, why did he make this decision?
"I decided that there's no risk of us losing money."
"... Why?"
"Because of you."
Count Almi너스' gaze was so blatant that I instinctively put my hands over my chest.
"If the business fails, you'll be deeply indebted to me, wouldn't you?"
"..."
"I'm just looking at this from a businessman's perspective. I believe you'll manage to pay off that debt, even if it takes a lifetime."
"..."
"Even if it takes a lifetime."
Finally, his last words cleared up my confusion.
"Ah..."
He's willing to take the risk because even if he loses money, he'll be able to make me his slave for life.
A chill ran down my spine.
But…
"What do you think? Still want my help?"
"Of course."
Without a moment's hesitation, I nodded, and the Count burst into a hearty laugh.
"I knew you'd say that. Getting used to this, it's actually much easier than I thought."
"Easier? What do you mean?"
"These kinds of conversations, I mean. We don't have to hide our intentions and drag things out, saving time and reducing mental exhaustion. It's efficient. I wish everyone were like you..."
The Count, who had spent a lifetime navigating a world of intrigue and deception, seemed to find this 'Barbarian Business' style refreshing and appealing.
"Anyway, I'll be on my way."
"Why don't you have a meal first?"
"I have other plans!"
"Haha, next time, make sure you have time to stay for dinner.  I find our conversations quite enjoyable, strangely enough."
"Okay."
After wrapping up my meeting with the Count, I immediately headed towards the Prime Minister's mansion.
"Mr. Yandel 남작...?"
The butler at the mansion was quite flustered upon seeing me, an unexpected visitor.
"Excuse me, but we haven't received any notice from the Duke..."
Well, who else would barge in without an appointment in this aristocratic world?
Especially into the mansion of the country's second most powerful figure.
"You're right, it's only natural you wouldn't have received notice."
"... Yes?"
"Is the Duke in?"
"He's, uh, out on official business."
"Oh, in that case, I'll just wait inside. Please show me the way!"
"Well, I'd like to politely suggest that since the Duke is busy with affairs of state and we don't know when he'll be back, perhaps you could reschedule your appointment and return at a later time—"
What's he talking about?
I already tried to schedule an appointment, but he kept ignoring me.  That's why I came here myself.
"I said, I'm waiting inside! I'm not that formal with the Duke! Just lead me to the living room."
I practically pushed aside the flustered butler and entered the mansion, and seeing as the situation unfolded like that, the butler had no choice but to welcome me as a guest.
And…
One day, two days, three days…
Well, I didn't intend to wait this long, but anyway.
I ignored the butler's pleas to leave, and after two days, he stopped providing meals, so I had to make do with the jerky I had. I stoically endured all sorts of obstacles placed by the knights who were trying to force me out.
"Ugh... I don't have time for this. Tell me already. What's so important that you're going to all this trouble?"
The Duke finally appeared.
