## The Legend of the Inhabitants (2)
Every world has its legends.  
Lapdonia was no exception. 
Rumors had swirled among explorers for generations, tales of encounters with unknown beings within the labyrinth, beings capable of speech. Some spoke of rescues, a chance encounter with a creature offering aid in the face of danger. Others recounted escapes, narrowly dodging the clutches of a ravenous beast before being devoured.
"That's a common fantasy among explorers," Erwen scoffed. 
As Erwen pointed out, most explorers had entertained the notion at least once. Could there be a sentient being in the labyrinth, a creature of reason amidst the chaos? 
"Interesting... quite intriguing...," Amelia whispered, her eyes gleaming as she listened to the tales of 'the inhabitants.' 
"What about the bodies at the entrance? Was that their doing as well?" 
The female explorer Amelia addressed tilted her head in confusion. 
"Bodies at the entrance... what bodies?"
"Don't you know? There were three of them," Amelia replied.
As soon as she described their features, the explorer flinched.
"MacHolden, Prinston, Rick... the three taken during the initial raid...  They weren't in the village where we were held.  I hadn't imagined...," she trailed off.
"The initial raid...  Tell us everything from the beginning. Be as detailed as you can. Everything, starting from the point you separated from the Hekt Clan."
"Yes...? How did you...?"
"They were the ones who told us about this island."
"...I see." 
We should have followed them then. The female explorer murmured under her breath, then continued.
"After separating from the Hekt Clan, we started exploring the interior of the island." 
The first region discovered.  A new type of monster found there. 
Their mission was fraught with danger, and the battles proved difficult without prior knowledge of their enemies. However, at that point, their spirits remained high.
"Tentaculan, Diamount, Guldarmju, Papagonas.  Bailonta...  We named each new monster we encountered, making our journey feel like a grand adventure from history."
Papagonas, Bailonta. These were monsters we hadn't discovered yet. We would ask about them later.
"We came across an unusual trace while heading towards the center of the island." 
Footprints leading towards the core.  They were twice the size of human footprints, and many in number, as if a group were moving together.  But...
"Their shapes were all different. And they were flat.  Like they were wearing shoes..."
Excited by the discovery, the explorers believed these were the footprints of a new monster and followed their trail. The already dense forest grew even denser, and the monsters they'd occasionally encountered vanished completely.
"That's when the first attack occurred."
Creatures lay in ambush, attacking from all sides. They fought back desperately, but three were kidnapped, including the Clan Leader's lover. 
Of course, the Silverlion Clan went crazy, pursuing them deeper into the island. 
"However, we were pushed to our limits.  The second and third battles... many died." 
The biggest issue was that even with those sacrifices, they couldn't even capture a single monster. 
"I don't know why we were so slow to realize it, but they were intelligent. They communicated with a language of their own and moved strategically."
Realizing this, the Silverlion Clan turned and fled.  The Clan Leader, whose lover was kidnapped, was furious, but he eventually agreed to return and seek help from Lord Yandell.
But it was too late.
"On our way back, there was a trap set. We were definitely going back the same way, but it wasn't there when we came...," she explained, voice trembling.
They fell into the trap, were captured, and taken to their village blindfolded.
"How did you escape?"
"That's... one of the monsters secretly came to us and released us..."
"Released you...?"
From their description, the monster was quite small, much smaller than the others.  It appeared to be a child, based on their description.
"Were you close?"
"No. It's not like we could even communicate."
"Then why did it release you?"
"We don't... really know.  It came to the prison where we were kept and just stared at us, talking to us all day, but that was all."
Hmm, I see.  As I nodded, Amelia blurted out her immediate thought.
"It must have been sympathy."
Erwen agreed.
"My brother did the same thing.  He was always visiting the stables during the festival preparations, curious about the animals.  The day before the festival, he let them all loose."
The explorers' faces hardened at their words, but they didn't refute it.  They felt it too, deep down. They had been treated like animals in a cage, and only a child's sympathy had allowed them to survive.
"Ha, ha...  Kids are like that..."
Anyway, that was their story.  We then focused our questions on those 'monsters.'
What did they look like? How strong were they?  What was the population of the village? 
We gathered as much information as possible, enough to make a judgment.
"This should be enough to continue our exploration." 
The village's size meant seven of us weren't enough.  However, these monsters, as the explorers described them, were quite diverse, like human society. Not all of them were warriors.
The problem was that they had the advantage of the terrain, being familiar with the island.
Well, if things get tough, we can just run.
"Alright, lead us. Take us to the village."
"...Are you really going?"
"We came here to explore.  We must explore."
"..."
I gave them a pat on the shoulder, and the explorers wore sour expressions.
"I... can tell you the location, but maybe you shouldn't go yourselves, Lord..."
"Yes! We'd only be a hindrance!"
Their enthusiastic response suggested they didn't want to go back there. 
But...
"Do you have a boat?"
"Yes! We have a boat summoning inscription right here.  Mureton has it."
"Really?  Alright, then.  Go."
"...Yes?"
"What's the problem? If you can survive all the way to the coast, get on the boat, and return to the rock island, then that's the right thing to do."
By the way, the average level of the monsters we'd encountered so far was 3-4.  Luckily, we were all explorers, so communication was easy.
"...We will guide you to the village."
"Good."
We even exchanged names, as I felt a long-lasting bond forming. 
Marina, Chen, Krion, and Dennis.  Dennis, the spearman, was part of a small team, and the other three were members of the Silverlion Clan.
Well, they were practically disbanded now.
"Yandell, I'll take the lead from now on."
Our formation changed.
"Emily, you?"
"They said there were traps in the forest."
"But, that's exactly why *I* should take the lead—."
"Yandell, you are our leader. If you get hurt or captured, who will lead us?"
Amelia reasoned, placing herself at the forefront of the team.  She said she could spot traps better, so we should worry less. And, indeed, Amelia led the team,  spotting traps ahead of time.
It was a strange feeling for a tank.
'Being protected... is not so bad...'
Anyway, after traveling for about two hours, we reached our destination.
But...
"This... this is it.  Definitely under this tree...  Huh?"
There was no passage leading underground beneath the tree roots where they said they had crawled out.
"What happened?"
"I... I don't know."
"Did we go the wrong way?"
"No! That can't be. Didn't you see it earlier, Lord?  I found my lost shoe near here!"
It didn't seem like she was lying...  
Just in case they had mistaken the tree, we checked all the trees around, but we still couldn't find the entrance.
'Does the entrance open and close?'
We didn't yet know the details, but it was clear that the village was hidden beneath this tree.
Swoosh.
A child was wandering around, confirming our suspicion.
"I'll take the left."
"Then I'll take the right."
Erwen and Amelia immediately rushed in to cut off escape routes.  And, in an instant, they subdued their target.
Blue skin and large eyes.  Sharp, protruding fangs and a pointy head that looked like an alien's.
[Kyaaak-!]
The subdued monster thrashed violently, letting out a beastly roar. 
Of course, it didn't last long.
"Quiet."
Amelia held a dagger to its throat, worried about causing a commotion.
The monster stopped struggling and slowly looked up at me.
[Sa, save me...]
It spoke in the Ancient Language.
***
I can read and write the Ancient Language fluently.  If that's the case, speaking it should be possible too. A bit clumsily, but still.
[Are you the little one who released the four here?] 
I addressed it in the Ancient Language, and the subdued monster looked at me with surprise. 
So much for asking to be spared.
[Are you not going to answer?]
[Ma, yes… I released them. The four of them.]
[Why?]
[Because… they were piti, ful….]
The words triggered a common cliché.  You know, when a kind-hearted child accidentally does a good deed and ends up causing irreparable consequences.
"Yandell, what is it saying?"
"It says it released the four of them, and the reason was because they were pitiful."
I spoke to Amelia, but the four explorers nearby, upon hearing my words, looked troubled once again.
"That cursed monster dares to..."
"Lord, will you translate? Tell them that we're not grateful at all.  We're not grateful to those who cruelly killed our comrades."
I didn't translate.  
After all, this was the first creature discovered in the labyrinth that could understand human speech.  We needed to be as gentle as possible and extract information from it.
[What... are they saying?]
[They're saying thank you for helping them.]
[It… goes like this….]
Surprisingly, the little monster readily accepted my words.  It must be hard to read emotions through expressions and voice tone when the appearance and language are different.
But, like children everywhere, this little monster showed its curiosity even in this situation.
[How can you speak our language?  You're a monster.]
[Monster…?]
It was audacious, but a hard statement to ignore as a human.
[Why are we monsters?]
[Because... we look different from you.  Well, we can understand you, but….]
Is this it?  In a land of little people, even an ordinary person would be a giant.
[Okay, let's say we're monsters. Then what are you?]
I asked, chuckling. The little monster answered without a second thought, as if stating an obvious truth.
[We are... human.]
Somehow, the conversation had become quite philosophical.
