## The Return of the Glory (1)
The passage ended, and the space that emerged was similar to a control room. Rectangular glass panels filled the walls, displaying real-time conditions of every location within the building. 
“There are a lot of controls.”
Countless buttons and levers were scattered across the room, reminiscent of an aircraft cockpit.
“Yandell.”
Amelia’s call drew my attention. A screen displayed the room where our expedition team members were trapped. 
“No wonder we couldn’t find it, even after searching everywhere.”
The room had no door. There were dozens of rails leading in and out, suggesting the only way to enter and exit was through them.
“I think I understand how to get to that room now.”
To find it, we likely needed to board the correct rail and move in the right sequence. Like a mini puzzle game.
“The last floor of the tenth layer also had this, didn’t it?”
That part was truly evil. It required multiple attempts, and failure meant potentially wiping out the entire party.
“Thankfully, everyone seems to have returned safely.”
“What?”
“I mean, those who were taken away before I was. The ones with a high probability of turning into stones in the underground. Everyone seems to have returned, as you can see.”
“Oh!”
I finally scrutinized the screen, noticing that all the missing members, including Amelia, were standing unharmed in the room.
“What should we do now?”
Amelia’s question prompted a moment of contemplation. Countless buttons and levers… If we could manipulate them correctly, we might be able to rescue our team from this place.
“For now, don’t touch anything, just stay still.”
We didn’t know what these buttons were, so we couldn’t risk tampering with them. After all, it would be disastrous if we accidentally triggered a button that released poison gas.
“Do you… think I’m you?”
“I said it just in case, just in case. Now, let’s start by pressing that one over there.”
“But you said not to touch anything randomly?”
“Still, we have to press something to figure out what it does, don’t we?”
Amelia and I started investigating from the control room. We sequentially pressed each button, beginning with the one farthest from the screen displaying our team’s room. This revealed a key fact.
The buttons below the screen influenced the position the screen was capturing.
With this revelation, we grew bolder, testing more buttons and levers. Soon, we understood the purpose of most of them.
“The red button stops the rail, the green button reactivates it, the left lever moves it in reverse…”
The right lever switched the displayed screen, allowing us to control the corresponding area. Each button and lever had a different purpose.
However, there were still three buttons and levers whose functions remained unknown.
“I wonder what those are for.”
Unlike the other buttons and levers located below the screen, these were situated alone in the center of the room. We couldn’t examine them rashly.
They seemed significant, wouldn’t you say?
As I expected, these likely affected the entire building.
“If we want to find a way to that room, turning one of us into a stone and following it would be the fastest.”
Amelia’s advice elicited a chuckle.
“As if we didn’t think of that. It seems harmless, but we don’t know what side effects might occur.”
“Then I guess we have no choice but to keep waiting like this.”
It wasn’t a terrible option. There was the drawback of having to wait endlessly for each member to appear. However, this approach guaranteed we would eventually rescue them all.
…Assuming the current conditions remained the same.
“Or we could search ourselves.”
“Search ourselves?”
“Yes.”
I checked the underground factory through the screen. The number of gathered members had already exceeded twenty.
If we halted all rails within the building and sent everyone in to search directly, it might be much faster.
“Plus, we need to find that room to search it as well. We don’t know what’s hidden inside.”
“Right… We came here for an expedition.”
“Exactly. We haven’t discovered anything yet.”
Escaping this temple was easy. I could simply leave through the entrance I arrived from.
But what was our purpose in being here?
It was to escape this dreadful first floor and return to the city. However, we still couldn’t find a way to leave this Rainbow Island.
“I understand where you’re coming from.”
With our minds aligned, there was no need to hesitate.
Amelia and I started pressing buttons, disabling all rails within the building. We then descended to the lower levels, joined the main group, and explained our discoveries and future plans.
Day after day, under Amelia’s command, we diligently created a map of the complex rail network.
“Everyone, take a copy of the map! It’s updated to yesterday’s information!”
“I checked this side to the end, but it just leads back to this path. Let’s check the other side today.”
Everyone was working together, striving towards a single goal.
I watched them through the screen, from the top-floor control room.
I had come to check the reports that moving rails had been discovered during the expedition…
“What’s this? I’m sure I turned it off before?”
Finding and disabling the problematic rail wasn’t difficult.
The problem was…
“Hiss, hiss…”
As I was about to descend, all the screens abruptly went black.
And then…
[May we have a word?]
A strange voice echoed from the depths.
***
The ancient language, a request for conversation. 
A rainbow-colored light emerged from the central screen.
[Don’t worry. I have no intention of harming you.]
The light pulsated with the sound of its words, stretching and contracting like a rubber ball.
No AI, for sure.
How should we approach this situation? A mysterious being is trying to communicate from the depths of the screen.
[Mark, it’s been a while. I’m relieved to see you’re well.]
As I was considering the situation, the mysterious being addressed someone with a greeting.
“Mark?”
[Could it be… that you’re addressing me?]
I tilted my head in confusion, and simultaneously, Hamsik asked hesitantly, looking at the screen.
[Ah, I forgot, you don’t know who you are, or why you’re here. That’s precisely what you wished for.]
[What are you talking about? Do you know me?]
[Of course I do.]
Hamsik’s hand tightened on my hair as he received the affirmative reply. 
He was just as flustered by the sudden situation.
Time for a friend to step in.
“It’s great to see you, but how about a self-introduction? Who are you?”
[The director of the research facility. If you need a name for me, call me that.]
“Director is too long. Just call me Director.”
[As you wish.]
I had asked casually to gauge his personality. His response was surprisingly lukewarm. 
He didn’t seem to care about titles, whoever this guy was.
“Well, Director, tell us. Since you’ve appeared before us, there must be a reason.”
Instead of finding out who he was, I asked his purpose first. That’s what I prioritized when dealing with unfamiliar individuals. 
What is this guy’s objective?
Sadly, the Director evaded the question.
[Captain White, how’s that friend of yours?]
“…..Captain White?”
[Even buried here, I know things. You recently met that friend of yours, didn’t you?]
Intuitively, I understood who ‘Captain White’ referred to. The one we met in the strange space after defeating Dreadfear, the Lord of Fear.
“…..Who the hell are you guys?”
[You are both a blessed and cursed being. Mark, your friend is the same.]
“You’re not telling us, then.”
[Don’t be impatient. You will eventually find the truth, Mark.]
Even his lines were similar to Captain White’s.
The difference was Captain White’s was a question, wondering if I could discover the truth. The Director’s tone was confident, assured.
[But I can give you a clue. Conveniently, your friend Mark is right next to you.]
“A clue?”
[Before we begin our story, let me ask you first. Mark, do you want to know your past? I must warn you, it was your request to lose your memories.]
Hamsik’s body trembled in response to the Director’s question.
But the moment didn’t last.
[I want to know.]
Hamsik’s reply made the light on the screen stir.
[The place you are in now is called Pantelion. A research facility run secretly by the Empire in the past.]
He was going to talk about Hamsik, but why is he talking about the facility?
It felt strange, but I decided to listen without interrupting. 
Hamsik had also mentioned being in this place before.
[The Empire’s sole purpose in establishing this facility was to create biological weapons more loyal and powerful than any soldiers.]
[Countless mages, scholars, and alchemists gathered, dedicating themselves to studying and experimenting with all the knowledge of the world. However, their research results remained limited.]
[This situation changed with the appearance of the Witch. A war of unprecedented scale erupted, forcing the Empire to take action.]
[All of the Empire’s talents were gathered at the facility, with unprecedented levels of support. Most importantly, new test subjects were recruited.]
[They had only been able to acquire a small number of monsters through a treaty, but now thousands were brought in daily. Some of them were creatures created by the Witch. Pantelion’s research made tremendous progress in a short span of time.]
The light on the screen flickered like a pair of eyes suddenly opening.
[Mark, one of those subjects was you.]
[I… was a test subject…?]
[Yes. You were captured and subjected to harsh experiments here. Until the Witch, someone you had once helped, led an army against the Empire.]
[…..So I was freed thanks to the Witch?]
[No, you weren’t freed. You lost your life in the process.]
[Dead? Then why am I here?]
[It signifies that your death had such profound meaning to the Witch, deeply etched in her mind, unable to be erased.]
[No, I don’t get it! What does that have to do with me!]
Hamsik’s shouts were met with the Director’s monotone reply.
[As you died in the Witch’s arms, you said, “If there’s a place you call the Dawnland, I wish I could go there and live peacefully, forgetting everything, reading books.”]
That was all the Director had to say about Hamsik’s story.
Then, he continued.
[I’m in a similar situation, Mark. Although I made many mistakes in my human life… I eventually earned a chance to atone to the Witch.]
His voice was still clearly monotone.
[But time changes everything.]
Unless it was my imagination, his voice sounded different.
[Don’t you feel that too, Mark?  Ultimately, you couldn’t endure the long time and escaped from there.]
[I was just forced—]
“Enough! What are you trying to say?”
My big data showed that none of the guys who kept talking like this were normal.
This guy was the one who appeared first, after all.
There was a high chance he was behind the kidnapping of my team.
No matter how you looked at it, this guy wasn’t someone you could trust.
[I want to make you a proposal, Mark.]
“A proposal…? Tell me.”
[I will help you leave this place.]
I guess listening to his offer wouldn’t hurt.
