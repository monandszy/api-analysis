## Deja Vu (3)
“Tell me everything in detail. What happened?” 
I needed to confirm all the details before making my final decision.
“Oh, you mean that? He disappeared on the day we set out, so the commander went to find him.  But when he found him, he was making excuses about having a stomachache and being unable to join the expedition.”
“...”
“Apparently, he was crying and making a huge scene, so they ended up calling a mage to check on him.”
“Check…?”
“They used magic to check his insides, right? Apparently, there was nothing wrong. When they accused him of trying to desert, he changed his attitude, looking like he couldn’t help himself, and joined the expedition… but…”
“…but?”
“It seems that rumor has spread, and people within the expedition force are getting a bad impression of him. Even the priests who came from the same sect don’t treat him like a human being.”
“I see…”
Ugh, I shouldn’t have asked.
Seeing how desperately he tried to avoid joining the expedition force, it must have been because his ‘sixth sense’ was activated.
Thump-
Could it be that, like Ice Rock, I’ll have to endure a grueling experience again? 
***
The four ships that had set sail from the rocky island docked at the Library Island. After briefly adjusting the formation, we descended the stairs.
By the way, the formation meant our group of 38 was at the front.
I had a bad feeling about it, but I shook my head and tried to dismiss it.
‘…They put us at the front because we were the advance party.’
Yeah, yeah, we’re not like cannon fodder.
Even if I were the commander, I’d have done the same. 
Ugh, why does my back feel so uneasy?
‘…Damn those royal bastards.’
The battle of Verzak, and Ice Rock.
I’ve been double-crossed by those royal forces twice, so I can’t trust them in the slightest.
“We’ve arrived.”
While keeping an eye on the rear more than the front, I descended the stairs, and the vast underground library appeared before us.
The books were already neatly organized.
And…
[…You’ve arrived? Sooner than expected… uh…?]
Hamsik, who had come to greet us upon our arrival, tilted his head in confusion at the sight of the expedition force following us. 
Ugh, why is he doing this again?
I waved my hand, signaling him to go back and hide, but he still seemed clueless. 
Therefore…
Swish, swish.
I pointed my thumb at the expedition force behind us, then my index finger at Hamsik.
Then…
Swish.
I made a gesture of slicing my neck with my hand.
They’re not as kind as me, you see.
I’m not kidding, they’ll cast a Distortion spell on you and kill you, then start dissecting you the moment they see you.
Did my urgency get across?
[Beep—!!!]
Hamsik, understanding my gesture, panicked and ran away.
At that moment.
“Lord Baron, what happened? I thought I heard a terrible scream somewhere.”
A member from the main force, who had been trailing a distance behind our group of four, approached.
Okay, it seems he didn’t see Hamsik.
“Nothing much.”
“Excuse me?”
“I don’t know the cause, but sometimes this place makes these kinds of noises.”
“Ah, I see. Understood. I’ll pass it on.”
This way, even if I meet Hamsik secretly to chat, the expedition force won’t think it’s strange. 
Well, I need to be careful since someone might try to investigate the noises.
“This is the place Baron Jandel mentioned.”
“What do you think?”
“What do I think? My personal opinion is meaningless. Now, let’s get started without wasting time. We’re not just exploring. We are carrying out a sacred mission given by the royal family.”
Ugh, the royal family’s biggest fan.
As Jerome gave instructions to the deputy commander, the deputy commander shouted in a booming voice.
“All units, listen up! We’ll start with a terrain survey. Each survey team, search the surrounding area thoroughly.”
Thus began the terrain survey.
I approached Jerome and asked,
“We’re short on time, so there’s no need to do another survey, right? We’ve already explored this area.”
Perhaps Jerome doesn’t trust me, just like I don’t trust the royal family.
That was my first thought, but…
“Heh, our expedition force is comprised of only the most skilled experts in exploration, handpicked by the royal family. It’s not that I’m disregarding Baron Jandel’s capabilities as an explorer… Just watch. You never know, we might find something new.”
The tone of his voice revealed that he was simply ignoring us.
‘Exploration experts my ass.’
Most of the mages are from the military, and there’s a ton of knights and priests. This is a bunch of battle-obsessed idiots.
“Do whatever you want. But we’ll stay here.”
“As you please. If we couldn’t find it before, there’s no way we’ll find it now.”
…Should I really punch him?
The thought crossed my mind, but I suppressed it with superhuman patience.
How much time had passed?
“…Nothing new has been confirmed.”
“Same here.”
Ultimately, the expedition force’s survey teams returned empty-handed, and only then did the library exploration begin.
“It’s better to proceed as the baron suggested. Unlike the baron, we have the capability to explore every single book shelf, you see.”
That jerk still seems untrustworthy, but he did show a professional demeanor as the exploration started.
“So it’s like this.”
After using the summoning book a few times, he seemed to grasp the situation quickly. He quickly reorganized the formation and efficiently distributed the 200-plus personnel.
Dozens of people flocked to the bookshelves to find books, and twice that number stood in front of the stone gate, hunting monsters as they emerged.
But…
“This is going to take forever.”
Jerome seemed to find this slow, and brought out his ultimate trick.
“Evoust, speed it up.”
All discoveries in this world arise from necessity.
“Excuse me? But since we can only summon one book at a time, speeding things up further here…”
“That’s why I’m asking you to find a way.”
“…”
For a moment, the deputy commander looked dejected at the unreasonable request of his direct superior, but he came up with a creative solution that even I hadn’t considered.
“Even if we can just reduce the time it takes for the gate to open and close once, we can increase the pace significantly.”
“So, what’s the conclusion?”
“What about breaking down the gate?”
“!!!”
Even the barbarian was startled by the solution. Jerome, however, nodded in satisfaction upon hearing the plan.
“A plausible approach. Implement it right away.”
As soon as the order was given, the magic engineering corps within the expedition force gathered.
Then, dozens of them cast a spell together.
“Maertii Esta Pioryuev De Teila!”
The completed spell was a magic spell I’d never seen in reality, even once.
Well, where would I even see a Level 1 attack spell.
[Gaeheon Vessel is casting Level 1 attack spell, [Breakthrough].]
As soon as the spell was complete, the magic circle glowed, and my breath caught. The density of magic was strong enough for even a barbarian warrior, who’s insensitive to magic, to feel it strongly.
It was impossible to see.
———————!
A flash of light as fleeting as a moment.
I could vaguely sense that something had been launched and collided with something, but when I opened my eyes again…
Woosh—!!!
A hot wind, like it was scorching me, blew past my cheeks.
However, I didn’t have the capacity to focus on that sensation.
“…Thankfully, it worked.”
The enormous stone gate, towering at least 20 meters tall, was completely destroyed, leaving only a void of endless darkness.
‘It… worked…?’
I felt as if I’d witnessed a new level of mastery.
***
We had succeeded in breaking down the stone gate.
And the plan to accelerate the summoning through that method was working as well.
“Since the gate is gone, every catch results in a summon. Well done, Evoust.”
“I merely followed the royal order. I don’t deserve any praise, Commander.”
The two, who had eliminated the delay caused by summoning monsters with a brutal method, continued their conversation naturally.
In the end, I was the only one who could step up.
“Wait, look over there! It’s already restoring from the end.”
This was the nature of the maze.
The maze, including the crystal cave on the first floor, had the characteristic of naturally restoring itself everywhere except for certain special locations.
In other words, the expedition force’s mages had just wasted a Level 1 spell…
“Is there a problem?”
Jerome looked confused, so I explained it in a way that was uncharacteristic of a barbarian, being quite detailed and clear.
But that was just a futile effort.
“Even if you say that, I don’t understand what the problem is. Since it’s restoring, we just keep breaking it down, right?”
“Uh…?”
“Judging by the restoration rate, there’s no need to use a Level 1 attack spell like this again. We have plenty of mages, so they can take turns breaking it down.”
“…Uh.”
“Besides, there haven’t been any monsters strong enough to require mages yet, right?”
Uh… that’s true.
“Are you satisfied now?”
“Yes. I’m satisfied.”
In the end, I had to admit it.
‘The one who’s lacking… is me…!’
Those who possess power can realize more, and therefore, can paint a more grandiose image.
Therefore, the reason why I couldn’t come up with this method and dismissed it as absurd was because of my lack of power.
Imagination is power born from power.
‘That’s why the character for ‘power’ is in ‘imagination’ too.’
Indeed, the wisdom of the ancients.
They must have already understood this principle thousands of years ago.
“Let’s resume the mission!”
Whether I realized something new or not, Jerome, as if every second was precious, didn’t waste any time.
That’s the attitude you’d expect from someone who received a mission from the royal family, right?
Thanks to his earnestness, the exploration speed was significantly faster than ours. Although we had been engaging in factory farming-style hunting, it was incomparable.
“Leave the magic stones alone! We’ll collect them later.”
The expedition force didn’t even pick up magic stones, and didn’t check who owned the essence even when it appeared.
Since most of the hunting was done by long-range attacks, there were no mishaps of obtaining unwanted essence, and in cases requiring close combat, knights filled the field, their essence levels maxed out.
And as a result…
‘We’ve reached Level 4 in just one day…’
To be precise, we had entered the stage where Level 4 monsters started appearing in less than 16 hours.
The speed was nearly five times faster than when our group of 38 was exploring.
“We’ll proceed normally starting tomorrow. Pass that on to the Magic Engineering Corps. There’s no need to prevent it from restoring anymore.”
“So…?”
“We’ll end here today. Prepare for camp.”
The exploration, which had been carried out without any gaps, even for meals, was finally halted, and the long-awaited rest time arrived.
The expedition soldiers, who had spent a grueling day, skillfully set up the campsite, and when I had some free time, familiar faces were the first to visit.
“Ha, ha, are you very busy?”
Meland Kaislan.
The military-出身 knight who had been our comrade during the Ice Rock expedition.
“Even if I’m busy, I have to make time when you’re here.”
“What an honor.”
Kaislan grinned and stuck out his fist. I greeted him back with a light punch.
We had exchanged glances while passing by, but we hadn’t had time for conversation like this.
“I never thought I’d have a chance to chat with you like this.”
“I heard that if you join the Earl of Saintred, you’ll experience hell, but I never thought it would be this bad.”
It seems the rumor of his terrible reputation among military-出身 individuals had spread.
“So what’s your story? Did the royal family order you to join?”
“That’s right. Heh, it seems they want to use me as much as possible before I retire. Well, they said the purpose is to rescue the baron, so I don’t have any major complaints.”
“Retirement? Did you apply for it?”
“I submitted the application a month ago. It usually takes a while to process… but I’m hoping it’ll go through by the end of this expedition.”
“I see…”
“Why do you look so gloomy?”
“Nothing. I was thinking about what to eat for dinner.”
I just gave a casual excuse, but it wasn’t true.
It was just that, knowing Kaislan was about to retire but was ‘forced’ to be here, I suddenly remembered the Ice Rock expedition.
‘If he had something in mind, he’d have made Marone join the expedition force too… but I’ll keep it in mind for now.’
Nah, I don’t want to dismiss it like that. I decided to keep the worst-case scenario in mind.
“Sir Kaislan! It’s great to see you again!”
Besil, Erwen, and Amelia, who were also members of the expedition, came over and greeted Kaislan. As they were exchanging greetings and catching up, another unfamiliar face appeared.
“I apologize. The Archbishop said it was her first time camping, so I was helping her… I was going to come right away, but I’m late.”
Sven Parav, the Goblin Mask.
As soon as he appeared, Besil approached and glared at him.
“You’re here.”
“Oh, it’s been a while… Miss Goul—…?”
“I know. ‘Long time no see,’ Mr. Parav.”
He saw her recently at the Round Table, but he’s acting like that.
It’s just cute from my perspective, knowing their real identities.
“Just a sec, everyone, can you make some room?”
“Yes, of course. I feel like I’m being watched by the people from the sect if I stay too long—”
“Parav, everyone but you.”
“…Excuse me?”
After exchanging greetings and catching up, I dismissed everyone around me and had some time alone with Parav.
“I… what’s going on…?”
“You pretended to have a stomachache to avoid participating in this expedition, right?”
“Did Sir Kaislan tell you that too?”
“No, I heard it from someone else.”
“…You heard it from the mage in gold, right?”
It seems he deduced the answer from the fact that Raven, my former teammate, was on board our ship.
However, it didn’t matter to me.
“Why did you do it? Did you get that ‘weird feeling’ again?”
“I… it’s a little different from that…”
After being asked repeatedly, Parav hesitantly opened his mouth in a voice that sounded resigned.
“I think I… received a prophecy…”
What…?
***
A world where God exists.
The people here sometimes hear God’s voice or receive a revelation. Sometimes, they even receive holy relics to help with their ‘revelations.’
Anyway, that’s not the point.
“You received a prophecy…?”
“Be… be quiet! I’m listening!”
Not everyone receives a prophecy.
That’s why, in this city, those who are blessed to hear God’s voice are called ‘saints’ or ‘saintesses.’
But…
‘This guy is a player.’
Sven Parav is an Evil Spirit from Earth.
And the Three Gods Sect is just as serious about hunting Evil Spirits as the royal family. But, the head honcho of that sect, God, giving a prophecy to an Evil Spirit?
“…Are you sure? That… you received one.”
“I… well, it, it seems like it.”
My mind is filled with doubt.
What kind of things are those Gods thinking?
Now that I think about it, when I almost died fighting the Dragon Slayer and came back to life, they gave me a relic to help me too.
“So what’s the content? What story did you hear that made you do that?”
“I… it’s just… ”
I was trying to quickly find out the contents of the prophecy, but, unfortunately, someone interrupted us.
“Mr. Parav! The Archbishop is looking for you! Come quickly!”
“Oh, excuse me… ? Ah, yes! I understand!”
He looked at me nervously and quickly responded. Then, he went to where the members of the sect were.
‘…I’ll hear the details tomorrow.’
I was disappointed that I couldn’t hear it right away, but I decided to wait until tomorrow. I just filled my stomach with jerky and closed my eyes, lying down in my blanket.
How much time passed?
‘I can’t sleep.’
I got up to get a drink of water when I felt a piercing gaze from somewhere.
I looked around quickly, and saw Hamsik hiding behind the bookshelves, apart from the patrol guards.
“Ahem…”
“Lord Baron, where are you going?”
“I can’t sleep. I just want to stretch, but it’ll be noisy if I do it here.”
“Ah, yes…”
I gave a plausible excuse to the guards who were on patrol, and approached the bookshelves. Hamsik, who had been hiding, yelled softly.
[What… what are those crazy humans doing here!!]
“Uh… they’re from the kingdom… They won’t harm you, so don’t worr—.”
[Harm me…?!!]
Hamsik, looking at the stone gate, which was still being restored, clenched his fluffy sheep fists. Then, he spoke to me in a sad voice,
[Why… why do I have to go through this twice…?!!]
“…”
[Why are all humans like this…?!!]
…I had nothing to say.
“I’m a barbarian, though…?”
Except for that.
