## Escape Plan (5)
It didn't take long for everyone in our expedition team to assemble. We had gathered everyone beforehand, just in case. 
"By tools, do you mean… weapons?" Erwin asked.
"Yes," I replied.
"Are we… really going to fight them?" Misha inquired, her voice laced with uncertainty.
"Why? Do you have a problem with an explorer taking down monsters?" I countered, the question itself serving as a sufficient answer for those hesitant to act.
"No, of course not."
"What are you doing? Obey the Baron's order!"
It was reckless.  Nothing had been definitively confirmed, and if we waited longer, maybe Amelia would return unharmed.  We should wait.  Despite these thoughts swirling in their minds, no one dared voice them.  They simply muttered amongst themselves, gathering their weapons.
"Is this… really necessary?" Ainar whispered.
"What else are you going to do? You want to tell me to leave them be?"
"No, no, not at all."
"How are you going to explain yourself if you do?"
"Well, I'd rather fight those monsters than you."
I was surprised by the lack of dissent.  
"Bjorn, calm down," Misha intervened, noticing my tense demeanor. "Everyone is scared…"
I looked around, meeting Auyen's gaze.  She flinched, quickly turning her head away.  Ainar did the same.
"Am I imagining things? They… may not be able to speak, but they're kind… I swear, I didn't say anything! I swear on everything!" Ainar mumbled, shaking her head vigorously in denial as she caught my stare.
I marched towards them.
"Ainar."
"Yes! Tell me!"
"Have you gotten so attached to those monsters after being friends with them?"
"No, no! It's… It's a problem with my head! The, the essence! It's because of that essence—!"
I couldn't keep up the facade of composure any longer.  I cut Ainar off, speaking in a decisive tone.  It wasn't entirely implausible that the essence was responsible, but…
"One of our own could be in danger. Get a grip. I'll be disappointed in you if you don't."
"Alright, alright."
Okay, that's one mind reset done.  The other explorers seemed to have finished their preparations as well.  There was no need for further discussion.
"Let's go."
I stepped out into the street, and dozens of explorers followed in my wake.  I practically ran, a quickening pulse drumming against my ribs.  My dulled senses, however, still detected a presence.
"Mister."
"Is that the one? The one who's been watching our house from afar?"
"Yes. Shall I capture him?"
I contemplated for a moment before answering.
"No, leave him be.  He'll guide us.  Tell us where we need to go."
"Oh…."
"Speed it up!"
With Erwin's help, we pursued the figure, a silent observer leading us somewhere.
"Explorers… there are explorers!"
"Aquititi… go inside! Go home, quickly!"
The monsters, living their ordinary lives in the village, were startled by the sight of our armed group.  They quickly vanished, seeking cover.
How long had it been?
"Well, it's not going towards the village chief's house…"
Where was he leading us?
My question was answered.
"I discovered a peculiar place today.  It was about fifteen minutes from the village chief's house, and it looked like a regular family home. But there were guards stationed around it."
The suspicious house Amelia mentioned.
"Stop."
I halted our advance, reaching the destination.
"Explorers! Lower your weapons!"
"It hasn't even been that long, and they've already gathered."
I muttered, staring at the swarm of monsters, dense as a plague of roaches.
"No way."
I wasn't here for conversation.
I was looking for someone.
If you have nothing to hide, then step aside.
There was no need for such words.  I didn't want to waste time talking when Amelia could be in danger.
"Get out of my way.  If you resist, I will kill you."
This was the least I could do, a bare minimum of courtesy in this situation.
But Nyiacchichi, the village warrior, the village chief's right-hand man and Marupitchichi's father, ignored my final warning.
"The village chief ordered that no one is allowed to enter. Step back."
I wasn't particularly remorseful.  Nor did I bother trying to persuade him with another round of words.  I had warned him, and he refused to comply.  Therefore, I only had one choice left.
"Oh, is that so?"
"Yes, so please calm down—"
"Then die."
As warned, I swung my hammer with lethal intent.
"The character has activated [Gigantification]."
My body swelled, brimming with newfound energy.  I poured all of it into a hammer blow delivered with the full force of my being.
"The character has activated [Swing]."
Nyiacchichi, a bowman by trade, drew back his bowstring, hastily retreating.
Typical archer. 
Only quick on his feet.
"The character has activated [Transcendence]."
"The character has activated [Eye of the Storm]."
I swung my hammer and activated a grab move simultaneously.  A gust of wind swept in, catching Nyiacchichi, who was attempting to escape, and pulling him back.  Then...
KWAJIK-!
My hammer struck his crown, timed perfectly.  It wasn't luck, nor a fortunate accident.  When you fight day after day, these kinds of timing maneuvers become second nature.  Especially against a warrior with exceptional combat sense.
"[…?] "
Nyiacchichi stared up at me, his upper head crushed like a dented can.  Blood trickled down his forehead.  But as the village chief's trusted right-hand man, he was not killed instantly.
Therefore…
"One more."
I retrieved my hammer, lifting it high.  
WHOOO-SHOO-OO-NG-!
I swung my hammer with all my might.
This blow would make Marupitchichi an orphan, but what does it matter?  Nothing new under the sun.  Hans A. had been an orphan.  
"That cheerful kid will be fine."
Or, he'll join his father soon.
"Wait, what?"
It was in that instant, as I prepared to crush Marupitchichi's family, that something intervened.
"A sword."
My agility allowed me to see the type of weapon and that it was glowing white.
KWA-A-A-A-ANG-!
A powerful force jolted through the hammer's end, reaching my hand as the white blade made contact.
Flashes of light blinded me, but I forced my eyes open and focused on the front.  A cold smirk twisted my lips.
"He said he was too busy to meet.  But now that his subordinate is about to die, he shows up."
***
"…"
"…"
A tense standoff ensued.
"[…]"
The monster warriors who had weathered the storm with me just moments ago all stood armed, staring us down.  We were no different.
"…"
Magic, divine spells, abilities.  The explorers who followed me were ready to fight at any moment, their eyes locked on the unfolding scene.
And amidst the tension…
"Village Chief."
I was the first to speak.  I was about to run out of patience, anyway.
"Give me back my comrade."
A blunt demand, cutting to the chase.  But the village chief did not ask what I was talking about.  He didn't give me a strange look as if I was misunderstanding something.  Quite unexpected, but…
"Indeed, she was the reason for your arrival."
The village chief readily admitted it.  And that…
KWAAK.
My head, which had been boiling with anger, cooled down.  The tension in my already tense muscles tightened further.  There was room for interpretation in his reaction.  Meaning…
He was prepared to easily block us even if we resorted to force. 
No, that doesn't mean I was going to back down. 
"Is she dead?"
I asked, barely able to choke out the words after a prolonged staring contest.
The village chief gave a two-fingered double tap.  A gesture understood only by this tribe of monsters who called themselves human.  And, surely, that gesture meant…
"Don't worry.  She is alive."
He meant "no," wasn't dead.  The stifling tension eased slightly, and a sense of relief washed over me.  Of course, there was still the possibility that the village chief was trying to fool me.  
But, hearing those words, I could breathe again. 
"Give her back."
I repeated the demand, my voice stronger this time.  The village chief glanced at me and responded.
"What will you do if I can't?"
"I'll find her myself.  I'll smash anything that stands in my way."
"Surprisingly… you seem sincere."
Because it goes against my code to bluff with someone's life.
"I am stronger than you."
I nodded.
"That's possible."
"Aren't you afraid?"
Honestly?
"I've never done something I wasn't afraid to do."
"Hmm, I see.  You're quite the fighter.  Is she your lover?"
"…"
I didn't respond to that pointless question.
"If not, then you must care for your comrade deeply."
The village chief mumbled, his tone difficult to decipher. Then he spoke to his subordinates.
"[Nyiacchichi... ah, not now, I suppose. Anyone, bring the explorer woman who is inside.]"
Is she really alive?
"Give me a moment.  We'll talk about this later."
I waited, a mixture of anxiety and hope.  Then the monster warriors appeared, carrying Amelia.  She was unconscious, lying on a stretcher…
"What happened?"
"I simply knocked her out. I haven't done anything else that could harm her."
There were no visible injuries.  But appearances can be deceiving. 
"Let's take her back.  You're in no state to have a conversation now."
I took Amelia back and ordered the priests and mages to assess her condition.  Then…
"Just as the village chief said… It seems she was only knocked unconscious."
Relief washed over me, releasing the breath I'd been holding.
"Phew…"
Amelia was safe.  
That alone felt like a major hurdle overcome, but there were still mountains to climb.  Nothing had been resolved.
"So, are you ready to talk now?"
"Why did you kidnap Emily?"
"Kidnap? What a preposterous notion!  In fact, it's the other way around. She's the one who illegally entered our village."
Ah, so that's how it went down.  
"But if something like that happened, the proper response would be to call me."
"True.  However, I wanted to verify something beforehand.  Was she here out of personal curiosity…"
The village chief's gaze met mine.  Those fish eyes were always unsettling.
"Or was it on your orders?"
Before I could reply, the village chief continued.
"Ah, she claimed it was her own doing.  No matter how much we asked, she refused to answer.  Don't misunderstand, we only frightened her a little. We didn't actually cause her any pain."
"I'm thankful for that—"
"But you must take responsibility for this matter."
"…"
"Leadership is about accountability. Whether it was on your orders or not is irrelevant.  Your comrade disregarded our hospitality and broke the village rules.  And, on top of that, instead of clarifying the situation, she invaded our village without hesitation and attempted to kill our warrior."
I had nothing to say.  
Amelia's survival.  The fact that they returned her unharmed, and in such a wholesome way.  This proves my actions were excessive. 
"So, how are you going to take responsibility?"
The village chief's words were delivered like a final ultimatum.  His tone was devoid of any emotion, as usual, but that made it all the more oppressive.  It was because I couldn't understand his true intentions.
"What I need now… is not an apology."
I made my decision quickly.  First, I wouldn't evade responsibility as a leader.
"Emily Rains went there on my orders."
"Oh, is that so?"
"But there is a reason."
"I'm curious."
I decided to go all-in, even though I hadn't originally planned to reveal this.  Sometimes, a direct approach is the best answer.
"I 'accidentally' discovered a dagger with the Silver Lion Clan's insignia on it."
"And?"
"It raised some questions. Why is their weapon, which they supposedly left the village, here? So I started investigating behind the scenes."
"I see, that's how it happened…"
"Since things have gone this far, tell me. How did that dagger end up here, and what is hidden in this house you've been concealing?"
The village chief paused, considering my question.  
How long had it been? 
"First, about the dagger, I can't be certain because I didn't see it myself... but there was a time they bartered with the villagers before they left.  It's highly likely that the dagger got mixed in with those goods."
I expected that answer. 
I couldn't verify its authenticity, anyway.
As I stared back at him, the village chief continued.
"And about this house you mentioned… It's a bit of a problem, but… I think it's best if you see for yourself."
"Fine.  Show me."
The village chief gestured, and the warriors guarding the perimeter stepped aside, opening a path.  I followed the village chief into the house.
"Down here."
The ordinary-looking house held a stairway leading underground.  As I descended, I finally saw what these monsters had been hiding.
"Damn it."
The smell of decay wafted up from the stairs, so I had an inkling.  But...
"Here, this is what you were curious about—"
The basement was filled with decaying corpses.
"This is our village's secret."
The bodies were in such a horrific state that it was difficult to make out their forms, but their origins were obvious. 
"But now you know, too."
Human corpses.
