## Chapter 603: The Third Record (6)
The rift would clear upon defeating the guardian, and a portal would open. Stepping through that portal would bring us back to our original entry point. 
Well, at least that's how it's always worked, up until now.
“Two portals…?”
Even the colors are different – red and blue. It's like choosing between two pills. 
“If we choose the wrong one, will it lead us to some strange place…?”
The unexpected situation leaves me deep in thought. It seemed everything in this basement level was anything but standard procedure. Perhaps it’s fair to say everything here is shrouded in mystery.
“This essence… ”
The portals that opened with the clearing of the rift did not vanish with time. At least, that’s what I thought. I’m not sure if that rule even applies here, though.
Regardless, I decided to set aside the portals for now and examine the essence.
“Such a fascinating color… ”
The village elder’s eyes were still filled with curiosity. It must be his first time seeing a rainbow-hued essence, as he’d lived before the days of floor lords and rifts.
“Baron, can you explain what type of essence this is?”
“I don’t know.”
“Ah, did the Baron also encounter this monster for the first time?”
“No, not exactly… ”
A sigh escaped my lips as I answered, feeling a surge of frustration.
“Soul Eaters don’t normally drop essences.”
It’s not simply that I haven’t encountered one yet. Soul Eaters drop massive experience points, so even when skipping other monsters, I always hunted them down whenever I leveled up a new character. But not once have they ever dropped an essence. 
I even maxed out the essence drop rate with bonuses like Beginner’s Luck and Melton's Clover, yet the result was always the same. I assumed they simply didn't drop essences…
“This must be a new way to acquire them.”
So, what is the Soul Eater essence’s effect?  
It probably includes ‘Soul Cavalry’ summoning, as it’s an active skill.  But I’ll have to experiment with it once it's consumed to know for sure.
Of course, I don't intend to eat it myself.
“Gahyun! Wake up!”
I pulled Gahyun off my shoulder and lowered her to the ground. I gently slapped her cheeks. With this essence drop, there’s no time to wait idly. The essence must be contained within a vial within 30 minutes.
“Gahyun! Gahyun! Gahyun!”
So, I gradually increased the strength of my slaps. I don’t feel good about hitting someone who’s already hurting, but the essence comes first, right?
“Ugh… ”
Thankfully, Gahyun regained consciousness just as her cheeks were starting to swell.
“Bar…on? This place… ”
Gahyun’s speech was slightly slurred, as if the shock of her fall still hadn’t faded. I briefly explained the situation, using concise terms. Mages are similar in how they're managed, after all.
“While you were unconscious, a Soul Eater appeared as the guardian. I defeated it, and it dropped a guardian essence.”
“What, what?!”
As expected, Gahyun immediately looked at the essence with newfound vigor, her eyes wide with wonder. Of course, how could any mage resist a new guardian essence?
“Ugh, I… can’t stand up.”
“Of course you can’t. How could you with your legs like that? Even a Barbarian couldn’t move—”
“…….Aaaaagh!!!”
Gahyun finally saw her injured leg and let out a strange cry. But maybe she considered the essence more important than her shattered leg.
“Move me to the…to the essence. I can’t walk.”
As requested, I brought Gahyun to the essence and handed her the vial, as she instructed. 
Then, how much time had passed?
“Whew… I'm done.”
Gahyun carefully placed the vial containing the essence in the vial storage box, signifying the end of the essence extraction.
“However… what are those portals… Why are there two portals…?”
“Ah, those? We'll have to figure that out later. We don't know yet.”
“I, I see… ”
“So, what do you think?”
“If you ask what I think—.”
“Just say anything that comes to mind.”
“Hmm… one of them will definitely connect to our original location, I think… ”
Gahyun, who was freely expressing her opinion as I asked, suddenly trailed off. She stared blankly for a moment before exclaiming,
“The blue portal!”
She sounded confident, as if she’d realized something.
“Then the red one? What do you think about this one?”
“I… I’m not sure. It’s vague. It feels dangerous, but it doesn’t feel like a terrible choice.”
“It’s dangerous, but it’s a portal that could potentially provide a significant reward.”
“Oh, you could interpret it that way?”
Of course. I've played [Dungeon and Stone] for years. I can see right through it.
***
Thanks to Gahyun, our options narrowed down to two.  Well, we technically had two options to begin with.
* **Go through the blue portal to return safely.**
* **Challenge the red portal and aim for an additional reward.**
We had the necessary information to make a proper judgment before choosing.  So, which one should we choose?
“Given that clearing the basement level is our priority, leaving now wouldn’t be bad… ”
We must not forget why we came to this rift. Escaping the basement level is our goal, and the rift is just a stepping stone to achieve it.
And we've already cleared the rift.
But...
“It wouldn’t feel right to leave with just the Soul Eater essence... ”
I’ve only been here for a week, but the elder and the other two have been trapped in this rift for over six months. It was a massive rift.
Is this all the reward we get? I don't know how powerful the Soul Eater essence will be, but the Archbishop even went through a class change and vanished without a trace.
“It’s time to make a decision. You make the call. I’ll follow you anywhere.”
“Me too.”
The elder and Erwen handed the decision-making power to me. Gahyun, however, immediately tried to persuade me.
“Baron, let go of your greed. With the Archbishop gone, going further is excessive. You don't know what might be on the other side.”
Gahyun's argument was valid. 
But it's not just my personal greed.  
The additional reward on the other side of the portal? Okay, whatever it is, it’ll be helpful. But even if there’s nothing, it doesn’t matter.
I have entirely different expectations for that red portal.
“If I go through there… ”
Maybe I can get one step closer to unraveling the secrets of this labyrinth. It might help us escape the basement level.
And lastly, this is the most crucial part.
“It’s too easy.”
The difficulty is way too low. Well, we did lose the Archbishop in the process, but even considering that, it feels strange, doesn't it?
“Something just doesn't feel right… ”
In my experience, traps are usually hidden in situations like this. Therefore,
“For now, the decision is on hold.”
“Hold… you say?”
“Don’t we still don’t know what will happen to the Archbishop if we go back?”
“That’s true, but… ”
Gahyun trailed off. She nodded in agreement to my statement about the unknown, but both she and I knew the truth.
If we go back, it's highly likely that will be the end of it.
“But what can we do? Every action comes with sacrifices. Several people have already lost their lives since we came down here. If we die here, their sacrifices would be meaningless.”
It was a logically sound argument. Well, I can't deny that his speech did reveal his self-serving, petty mindset.  
But I'm just as petty.
“Regardless of the Archbishop's fate, I think we should investigate the surroundings before going through any portal. We must have missed something along the way.”
The four canyons. The field debuff that messed with our minds. The silent lord and the Archbishop who became Karui's priest. The boss battle that ended far too easily. We cleared the rift and opened the portal, but there are too many things I missed. And we might never be able to figure them out if we leave now.
“Must we really do that? I can’t even move properly right now.”
“Don’t worry. I’ll carry you and keep you safe.”
“Sigh…”
I've seen countless sighs. Gahyun’s sigh was clearly a sign of acceptance. 
Okay, then, that settles it.
“Alright, let’s go.”
I memorized the portal's location once more and led the way with the elder.
“This is…the direction where the monster was earlier?”
“That’s right.”
The Silent Lord, Siliert.  The place where he was buried. Before starting the investigation, I planned to revisit that location first.
After all, Gahyun is with us now.
“Is your ‘intuition’ still working?”
“For now, it seems to be.”
“You can’t speak once we’re close, so do your best to investigate. You’re not moving, so try not to get too scared.”
“I, I will… ”
Gahyun seemed eager to return and dive through the blue portal. However, it’s impossible for her to escape from my shoulder when she can’t even walk properly.
As we approached the Silent Lord’s domain,
「The character has entered the range of [Silent Oath].」
「All essence skills are sealed.」
The sounds were gone. Thankfully, it seems he’s still alive.  
Soon, the Silent Lord, buried in debris, appeared. 
“…”
“…”
He continued to stare at me with weary eyes. I strode towards him and bent over, ensuring Gahyun could see him clearly.
“!”
Gahyun, who initially trembled, touched his skin with her hand after realizing he wasn’t dangerous. 
And how much time had passed?
Tap, tap.
Gahyun tapped my shoulder, signaling for us to leave. 
“What did you think?”
As soon as we exited his domain, I asked,
“It’s clear he’s not our enemy.  The moment our eyes met, I felt a warning in my head telling me not to kill him.”
Hmm.
“I think… maybe the guardian was weak because of you, Baron.”
“Because of me?”
“Didn’t you say you could kill him but chose not to? I think that’s the reason.”
Simply put, it might have been a much harder boss fight if we had killed him.
“If that’s true, it explains why the boss fight was so easy.”
So, what about the Archbishop? He suddenly went crazy and changed classes into Karui’s priest.
Was this an intended event? Or could we have prevented it if we had handled it better?  
I have a hunch it’s the latter. It’s too unreasonable to be the former.
KWAANG-!
Suddenly, an explosion shook the ground.  
The origin of the explosion was the direction where the Silent Lord was.
「The Sealant, Siliert, has been slain.」
What in the world just happened?
The answer to that question came from the mouth of Gahyun, who was perched on my shoulder.
“The, the Silent Lord died… ”
The Silent Lord, Siliert, was dead.
And...
“We have to run! It’s not the time to be worried about what we missed during the investigation!”
“Calm down and explain what—.”
“The portal is closing soon!”
“What?!”
There was no need to ask how she knew. It must be her intuition again. 
“...Run!”
There’s time for contemplation later.
For now, I sprinted towards the portal with all my might.
“Sir! Behind you! The Archbishop is behind us!”
As expected, the Archbishop was the one who killed the Silent Lord.
“How fast is he?”
“About the same speed as us… B, be careful!”
Careful? Careful about what?
I don’t know, but I shifted my body slightly. 
And that was when—
POOK-!
Something sharp pierced my left shoulder. The wound wasn't that deep.
After all, I was carrying Gahyun on my injured shoulder.
“...Cough, cough!”
Gahyun coughed up blood, staining my upper body.
“Ugh… whew… cough…”
Gahyun’s breathing was shallow, as if she was on the verge of passing out, but it wasn’t a major problem.
The portal was right in front of us, after all.  If we just get out of here, she’ll be healed by the countless priests.
So, that means…
THUD.
As soon as we reached the portal, I threw Gahyun's body inside.
HOOONG-!
The portal was now half its original size, but it was still functional.
“Erwen, go in.”
“Sir! What about you?!”
Before it shrunk further, I tossed Erwen through the portal as well.
“What about you? Why aren’t you going?”
“I just don’t think this is the right answer.”
I turned around, and there was the elder, his expression grim, and the Archbishop, approaching from the other side.  
The Archbishop, with his bizarrely twisted spine, was floating in the air, covered in tentacles.  Just looking at him sent chills down my spine.
“You wouldn’t dare to go through the other portal, would you?”
“I’ll confirm one thing before that.”
“You really are one of a kind, even in this situation.  What do you want to confirm?”
“I remember you saying that you could kill the Archbishop if you went all out. Is that still possible?”
The elder paused for a moment before answering.
“I don’t know…”
He said that, but there wasn't a hint of hesitation in his eyes.
“No one else is watching, so it doesn’t matter how much damage you take. Once you’re dead, you'll be fine anyway.”
“Just answer the question.”
“Well, yeah. It seems doable.”
The elder shrugged and asked me,
“But why are you suddenly thinking about this? We’ll both be better off if we just leave.”
“I said I had something I wanted to check. Will you do it?”
“...I promised I would.”
With that, the elder’s sword erupted with aura.
HOOONG-!
The pure white aura, a trademark of Earl Saintred. But the elder’s aura was slightly different from the original owner.
‘What is this?’
The aura around the sword continued to expand. It felt as if there was no limit.
HOOONG-!
The Archbishop, who had seemed to lose his mind and rush forward at the overwhelming aura, paused for a moment.  
Then…
“How did you do that…?  Can you really use your old abilities?”
The words escaped my lips involuntarily.
“Well, if you consider it his old abilities, you could say so.”
The elder chuckled as he continued,
“The knights of this era are pathetic.”
“…”
“Aura isn’t meant to be used like that.”
With that,
——————!
A flash of light.
