## The Butterfly (5)
The flash faded, and my vision returned. Or at least, I wasn't sure if it was truly "returned," but anyway, when I opened my eyes, everything was hazy and blurry. Still, I had to gather as much information as I could from my senses.
Swoooosh—
I was sinking beneath the water. At an alarming speed.
Thump—
My body hit the bottom, sending a powerful vibration through my core.  Almost simultaneously, I felt a sharp pain in my shoulder.  It felt like I'd been stabbed by something sharp.
"Ouch, that stings."
I immediately turned my head to see what had happened. A monster resembling a goby, 5th-tier fish-type, a Hopfish, had its jaws clamped tightly onto my shoulder.
"This… this is..."
I recognized the creature, even through my blurry vision. It only appeared in two places: the 6th-tier Great Sea, and the 9th-tier Star Burial Grounds' Dreamfall Waterfall. It didn't take long to deduce my location.
"Character has entered a special region."
"Field effect - Dreamfall Waterfall applied."
Additional information flooded my mind, painting a picture of the sequence of events. My Dragon's Dispel had allowed me to teleport, but it was a bit… incomplete.
"Since I'm here alone, does that mean everyone else teleported randomly...?"
Suddenly, I began to worry about the rest of the party. Unless they were like Baekho, who could solo dungeon runs, a mage or cleric wouldn't last long in the 9th-tier. 
"I need to stop worrying about them now."
My priority was my own survival. First things first, I swung my arm and knocked the Hopfish off my shoulder. Then…
"Let's go."
Ignoring the heavy weight of my body in the water, I trudged forward. Finding the right direction was easy. The currents in the Dreamfall Waterfall always flowed towards the center of the field. If you simply floated a boat on the surface, it would inevitably drift towards the waterfall. That meant going in the opposite direction would eventually lead to land. Since the Hopfish was there, the land couldn't have been too far. 
Plop, Plop.
With each step, I sank up to my ankles in the muddy ground, steadily moving forward. Unfortunately, I wasn't alone for long.
"This is getting ridiculous."
The moment I took a step, monsters lurking beneath the surface of the water would wake up and aggro me. 
Wooosh—
I tried swinging the Devil Crusher, but it wasn't very effective. The water resistance slowed my attack speed, making it almost impossible to hit the aquatic monsters. 
Woosh—
They dodged the attack with surprising agility, then attacked once I finished my swing, biting into my body. 
"Damn these things..."
Eventually, I gave up on trying to shake them off and focused on moving forward. I ignored them as they clung to my body, chewing and gnawing, and kept going. 
"Hah! Hah! Hah!"
Since this was the initial area where the Hopfish appeared, I was able to reach land quickly. Or at least, it felt that way.
"Whew, I almost died."
I almost suffocated there, but thankfully I got out in time. Now it was time for payback.
Crunching, crunching, crunching!
I crushed the creatures that had dared to follow me to land with my hammer before collapsing onto the ground.
"Hah, hah, hah..."
I had been fighting the Dragon, then fell into the water, and now I couldn't even move a single finger. I lay on my back and rested, trying to process what had just happened. 
In a crisis, the most important thing was always... what to do next. The answer was obvious.
"I need to rejoin the others."
I had to explore the 9th-tier carefully, find the others, and join them. That was my top priority. An additional goal would be to look for clues or a way to escape the Star Burial Grounds.
"Ugh..."
I forced myself to get up, even though I wanted to lie down and rest. I might be able to survive in the 9th-tier, but the others, besides Baekho, wouldn't be as lucky. The more mobile I was, the more I had to push myself.
"...huh?"
I froze in my tracks. I couldn't believe my eyes, but…
"...Jeina?"
I had already found one member of the party.
***
She was only 5 meters away from where I was lying.
"Why didn't I see her before?"
On the other hand, I understood why I hadn't noticed her. I was in no state of mind to be observant. Anyway, that wasn't important.
"Jeina!"
I rushed over to check on her. From a distance, she looked like a corpse, but thankfully, she was still breathing. At least, for now.
Fwoosh.
I removed her heavy coat, revealing a teal inner armor underneath. It was the No. 2,578 Sky Armor. It didn't provide stat boosts, special abilities, or regeneration, but its defense was top-notch. I called it my "life jacket."
"She survived because of this armor."
Ironically, this was what was killing her now. The Sky Armor's chest piece had been dented, pressing against her sternum and her lungs. It looked like her ribs were broken, too. 
"Man, how am I going to take this off?"
I was in a tough spot. I had to remove the armor to treat her, but there was no way I could do it in her current condition. So…
"Don't blame me, it's for your own good."
I informed and reassured the unconscious Jeina before slipping my fingers into a small gap in the armor. And then…
"Aaaaaaaah!!!"
I pulled the armor apart with all my strength. If it had been in its original condition, there's no way I could have done it. But maybe because it had been so dented, its durability was compromised. 
The armor, which had been slowly coming apart, suddenly shattered like it was tearing.
"Will this… repair?"
I thought about it, but decided to not worry about it for now. If it didn't repair, I could just buy a new one. It looked like she had saved up a lot of money. 
Chwee, Chwee, Chwee, Chwee!
Once I removed the armor that was interfering with her recovery, I immediately used potions. The bubbles bubbling inside the potion made me ache just by looking at them, but she must have been close to death because even the potions weren't doing anything. 
I used another potion and kept watching her condition. 
Chwee, Chwee, Chwee, Chwee!
Just when I was starting to think I was only hearing horrifying sounds…
"Ugh… Uuuh…"
She let out a faint moan, indicating that her consciousness was returning. Then she started writhing in pain. 
As she moved, I noticed something. 
"There's a tattoo on her side."
It wasn't unusual for adventurers to have tattoos, but hers was peculiar. It was tiny, just about the size of a thumb. It looked like an amateur had drawn it, and the colors were faded, as if it had been there for a long time. 
"...Maybe she's from Noirarc?"
During my time in Noirarc, the pinnacle of slums, I had seen kids with these kinds of crude tattoos. They didn't get them by choice, but because of someone else… or rather, because of a momentary fling. Like the tattoo under Amelia's eye.
"Hah… Hah… Hah..."
After about 10 minutes, Jeina, who had been twisting and groaning, began to breathe heavily. She mumbled to herself.
"............"
Her voice was so small and her pronunciation so unclear that I couldn't understand what she was saying at first. It sounded like she was reciting some kind of incantation in a foreign language.
But as I kept listening, I realized…
"Uck..."
That it wasn't a language from this world. 
"...I never thought she'd be a Devil Spirit."
Perhaps the Devil Spirit language Baekho used to mock everyone had subconsciously stuck with her and had resurfaced. But something told me it wasn't that.
"Hah… Hah…"
She eventually stopped muttering and her breathing gradually returned to normal. From experience, I knew this was the time to start talking to her.
"Are you feeling a bit better?"
I gently shook her shoulder. She lifted her eyelids with a weak effort.
"What… what happened...?"
Wow, she's thinking about what happened first thing. Usually, kids like this are the ones who survive the longest.
Is it because she’s from [Dungeon and Stone]? 
"What's the last thing you remember?"
"I… got… hit by… the ship… and fainted..."
"After you fainted, I did what we planned and used the multi-instantaneous teleportation spell. But the Dragon interfered, and the spell didn't activate properly."
"In… complete...?"
"I think we all ended up being teleported to random coordinates. I landed in the middle of the Dreamfall Waterfall and had to swim to shore. Then I found you collapsed."
"That's what happened...?"
"How are you feeling? Can you stand? I need to leave this place soon."
"Just… help me up."
I helped Jeina to her feet, but she was too weak to stand properly, so I ended up carrying her.
"Ugh!"
"It's easier if I just carry you."
"...."
Staying in one place was unwise, so I carried Jeina while we talked.
"Where are you going...?"
"To the Land of Ancient Times.  It's in the center, so everyone will likely end up there once they wake up."
Furthermore, the Land of Ancient Times was connected to all the other areas.  It would be a convenient starting point for us to reach our next destination depending on the situation. 
"Anyway, I plan to avoid fighting if possible, so if you have the strength, try to detect anything you can."
"...I feel like a tool."
"If you don't like it, just recover first. That’s better for me too.” 
"...."
And so began our journey as the only two who were awake.  It felt less formal than usual,  being alone like this.  
"Does she know she’s going to be dumped if she doesn’t cooperate?"  
I couldn't tell, but I could sense her gratitude.
"Thank you. For saving me."
"Well, if you're so grateful,  make sure you heal me well when we fight. I noticed you always cast heal spells on Aures, even when we're both injured."
"...That’s just your imagination."
It definitely wasn’t. 
"So, you're a Devil Spirit too?"
I threw the question at her, catching her off guard. I felt her grip on my shoulder tighten.
"I guess I was right."
Jeina didn't reply immediately to my murmur. I couldn't help but chuckle.
"Why bother hiding it?  Being with Baekho is already considered treason in the royal palace."
That must have been the clincher. Jeina hesitated for a moment, then simply admitted it.
"...How did you know?"
"You spoke Devil Spirit in your sleep."
Her reaction to my evidence was unexpected.
"Me...? That's impossible..."
"People with sleepwalking problems usually don't know they do it—"
"No, that's not what I meant. It's just… impossible."
"Impossible, you say?"
I asked again, emphasizing the confusion in my tone. Jeina hesitated again before finally speaking.
"I’m a Devil Spirit, yes. But I have no memories of that world." 
...Huh? What’s she talking about?
