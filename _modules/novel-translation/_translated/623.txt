## Chapter 623: The Seventh District (1)
After spending countless hours navigating the Labyrinth together, you reach a point where a mere glance between comrades is enough to communicate. It was like this, even now.
‘Whatever it is, let's take them down first.’
My comrades understood my intentions, nodding and drawing their weapons. 
And in that moment, the enemy leader, sharing the same sentiment, charged at us.
"So you won't answer willingly, I see."
“Take them down!”
Their numbers, including the leader, totaled fourteen.  It irritated me that they weren't a multiple of six, a number conducive to forming a powerful bond. But this wasn't the Labyrinth; this was the city, so it didn’t matter.
“Character has cast [Gigantification].”
“Character’s physique increases, enhancing threat and physical stats proportionally to its size.”
Since I didn't know their strength, I enlarged my body first. Perhaps it was the sudden increase in my size that prompted their reaction. The charging enemies froze, their faces etched with surprise.
"B, Bjorn Jandel…?"
“…A giant!”
“The one they said was missing… how can he be here…?”
I’m grateful they recognized me, but…
“R, run!”
“We need to send for reinforcements—“
You’re trying to run now? 
***
It didn't take long to subdue all the Noark scum we encountered in the ruined Dimensional Square.  Although, our initial number of fourteen had dwindled to twelve in the process.
Ah, I should clarify that this wasn’t due to any escapees. They simply perished during their desperate flight.
‘These guys are better than I expected.’
They scattered with the precision of cockroaches, as though accustomed to coordinated escapes.  Catching the two fastest runners alive seemed impossible, but…
"Good job, Erwen. Losing them would have been a pain."
"…Not at all."
With the battle over, I approached the kneeling Noarks. 
‘Twelve. ‘
Definitely a more manageable number than before.
“Emily, strip them of their equipment, dead or alive.”
I decided to loot and interrogate them simultaneously, since I didn’t know how much time we had. This guy will do as my first interrogation subject, right?
"…Ugh!"
I grabbed the leader’s head, forcing him to meet my gaze.  He'd been keeping his head down and refusing to speak since his capture.
“Hey, Eyeball.”
Ainar, standing beside me, tilted her head in confusion.
"Huh? Bjorn, you know this guy?"
"No, I don’t."
"Huh? But how do you know his name?"
"…What are you talking about? I just called him Eyeball because I don't like his eyes."
How else would someone be named Eyeball? 
Ainar, lacking in prejudice as always, scratched the back of her head. I dismissed her thoughts, already accustomed to her presence.
“Anyway… Eyeball.”
I called him again, but he remained silent. Regardless, I asked him.
"We've just returned to the city after a long time, so tell us why you're here."
As expected, no response. I promptly smashed his subordinate's hand with my hammer. 
Not the leader…
KWAJI-K-!
"Aaaaaaargh!!!"
Subordinate A, shocked by the sudden attack, let out a pained scream. Starting with him, I systematically smashed every subordinate's hand, one by one.
Then, I returned to the leader.
"We've just returned to the city after a long time, so tell us why you're here."
The same question I asked before.
Needless to say, he didn't answer, so I smashed Subordinate A’s hand again, this time targeting the already broken one. 
KWAJI-K-! KWAJI-K-! KWAJI-K-!
I repeated the question to the leader once more, but he still refused to answer. However…
"…!"
Subordinate A flinched as I smashed his broken hand again. It seemed they all understood the rules of this interrogation. 
"Auyen, take them down again."
"Yes…!"
As I mechanically smashed them one after another, one of them, Subordinate G, shouted urgently.
"I, I!"
"…What?"
"I can answer your question."
"Oh, really?"
This was a calculated move, so I wasn’t surprised.  But, for Subordinate G’s leader, seeing his subordinate betray him, it was probably a different story.
"You traitorous scum…!"
Eyeball glared at Subordinate G, his eyes burning with rage.  However, being from Noark, a society of macho men, Subordinate G wasn’t intimidated. 
“What do you want me to do? You can remain silent and be done with it, but we’re the ones getting our hands smashed!”
"…You think he’ll spare you?"
"He won’t. But it's better to die a little less painfully, isn’t it?  What's the point of loyalty when you’re about to die anyway?"
"If they find out about your betrayal, your family back in your village…."
“Damn! Spit! You’re an idiot. You didn’t even know your subordinate was an orphan with no family?"
"…"
In my opinion, Subordinate G was the clear victor.
Eyeball couldn't muster a counter-argument against his logical and self-serving words. He seemed to be about to shout some curses, but…
"You traitorous—."
"Quiet."
"Cough-!"
There’s no reason to waste time watching these low-life squabbles.
“Alright, speak. Why are you here?"
Silencing Eyeball, I asked again.  Subordinate G explained what had happened in the city while we were gone.
It was simple enough to summarize. 
Firstly, it was about two months ago.
The Noark remnants who had escaped the city walls secretly infiltrated the underground city, their former dwelling place. They planned to invade Laphdonia.
"An invasion…?"
"…They’re insane."
My comrades were shocked, and Amelia shook her head in disbelief.  But, I wasn’t surprised. I'd heard this story from the jester at the Round Table before.
‘I never thought they'd move this quickly, though.’
Bersiel was surprisingly calm, having been present when the jester told us this story.
"So? What's the situation? Did you win? That's why the Seventh District is like this?"
"No, we didn't win. It's just a temporary lull for now."
“…Tell me more."
"Two days ago, they invaded several districts of Lavigon through the sewers, launching a surprise attack. Within a day, they managed to take over the districts.”
“Two days ago…?”
Continuing his story, I learned that today was exactly one day after the Labyrinth closed.
"They deliberately waited for the explorers to enter the Labyrinth.  They also timed it for after the royal forces were significantly deployed into the Labyrinth."
"Yes, that’s correct…."
Hearing this, my first thought was, ‘Why am I so unlucky?’. 
After all this time, I finally returned, only to find the city under siege.  Is this what they mean when they say, ‘A jinxed person will stumble and break his nose, regardless of how he falls’?
"Keep talking, don't stop."
"Ah, yes…."
Subordinate G continued to recount the course of the war. They targeted the first day, when the Labyrinth opened, and the second day, when the explorers returned.  
Thanks to their timing, they successfully pushed out the Seventh District's security forces and took control of the city.  And…
“Yesterday, they surrounded the explorers returning to the city in the Dimensional Square, captured them, and are holding them hostage. They’re currently facing off against the royal forces."
Finally, he relayed the current situation.
"The royal forces seem to prioritize these explorers' lives over the city's ordinary citizens, so they aren't pushing in so readily."
“But why were you here?”
"We were on patrol.  In case the royal forces sent in any infiltrators, and to search for any hidden Noark remnants.  Then, our patrol’s mage said he felt something in the Square..."
“Are there any other patrols?”
"Not in this area, but…."
He trailed off, seemingly hesitant to say more. This was my cue.
"Go ahead, speak.  I’ll spare you if it’s helpful.  No, I swear on my honor as a warrior that I will let you go, no matter what.”
The warrior’s oath, which I’ve used so effectively in the past.
Subordinate G looked as if he were contemplating his answer, before finally spilling his secret.
"The regular report time is coming up.  If we don’t submit a report on time, other patrols will come looking…”
"You bastard…!!"
Subordinate G was their last bastion of hope, it seemed.
Eyeball finally snapped as Subordinate G started to reveal everything.
Ugh, he’s such a nuisance.
"Can you handle that regular report?"
"Yes, I can.  I've done it a few times. He often threw it on me because he said it was a pain."
"Really?"
"You jerk! You've been taking advantage of me this whole time—!"
Well, now he’s useless.
KWAJI-K-!
Eyeball's head exploded in front of me, but Subordinate G only flinched for a moment, quickly regaining his composure.
“You have a Message Stone in the baggage you took earlier.  Give it to me, and I'll handle everything."
"Is this it?"
Hearing Subordinate G's words, Amelia quickly located and handed over the Message Stone.
"Alright, get to it. Don’t think of doing anything unnecessary.”
"Yes…."
Subordinate G received the Message Stone and used it to send a report to his superiors, claiming everything was normal.  Since he had done this before, it went off without any issues.
Therefore, it was time to continue our conversation.
“Anyway, you said several districts, but which ones exactly?”
"The Thirteenth District and the Seventh District."
"Ugh…."
"Why? Why are you making that face…? Did I do something wrong...?"
I’ve been hit by a curse.
Of all the districts, why those two?  Why is it always the Seventh District?
My sigh was endless.  But, I gathered myself and focused on the conversation.
"Alright, tell me. What about the holy grounds?"
The Thirteenth District is home to the holy grounds of the beastmen, while the Seventh District holds ours, the barbarians'.
As the Barbarian tribe’s chief, my concern naturally focused on the holy grounds first.
“The holy grounds are currently cut off from the city.”
“Cut off?”
“I, I’m just a low-ranking soldier, so I don't know the details… but they say the royal forces used a magic circle created long ago.  They say it was made to control the different races at any time… but that’s just hearsay. Nothing’s confirmed."
Subordinate G, realizing I was the Barbarian tribe’s chief, quickly added.
“B, but because they had the ability to completely cut off contact, the holy grounds are relatively unscathed.”
Relatively.
The word ‘relatively’ implied damage to the holy grounds, but…
Well, what can you do?
I can only be grateful that the damage was ‘relatively’ less.
"The Thirteenth District… what about the beastmen?"
Misha, worried about her homeland, chimed in, but a detailed answer proved difficult.
"I don't know much about that district… but I think the situation there is probably similar."
"Right… I see…."
Misha, clutching her lips, seemed worried for her family, even the ones she hated.
“Jandel, we’ve gotten all the information we need, shouldn’t we move now?”
“Move now?”
"Just in case. If we’re surrounded here, we'll be in trouble, no matter how strong we are."
Following Amelia’s advice, we decided to leave our current position.  We’d successfully submitted the report, but there’s always the chance someone might find us.
"Take care of the rest, except for this guy.  Make sure to erase all traces."
"What about him?"
Amelia glanced at Subordinate G, following my instructions.
And…
“He lives.”
Subordinate G jumped up at my response.
"I, I believe you, Lord Baron! I knew you’d keep your promise!"
"You’re making me laugh."
Amelia chuckled, knowing I’m a fake barbarian who values honor.
‘Still, with Ainar here, I can’t break my promise so easily.’
Of course, the real reason was that we still had things to learn from him.
CHIIIIIIK-!
With Bersiel’s magic and Amelia’s exploration supplies, we wiped away any trace of the corpses and moved silently.
Since the entire Seventh District was under the Noarks’ control, we needed to find a hiding place for the time being.  
"How about the house we used to live in? It's not too far from here..."
Following Erwen’s suggestion, we headed towards the house where I’d gotten a mortgage in the past.
It was high-walled and had a basement, making it ideal.  But, considering the city was a warzone, there’s no way our house was intact.
“Ah, no… My dream house… I was going to save up and buy it back again…!”
We arrived at the house, avoiding the eyes of other patrols.  The second floor was collapsed, as if a fire spell had hit it.  The house was charred throughout.
“Still, it's not bad.  Only the outside is damaged; the first floor is fine. The exterior being like this actually helps us hide. The wall has collapsed a bit, but it's not visible from our angle.”
Amelia gave it the ‘approved’ stamp, and we carefully entered the building.
And…
“Auyen, we're going to have a private conversation now.  Lock him up in the basement.”
"Yes."
Auyen took Subordinate G to the basement.
"It's dark, but you’ll get enough to eat."
"…?"
"Probably."
He seemed genuinely excited.
