## The Core of the Manticore
The Manticore. It was a Core Essence I’d intended to erase someday. That’s why I’d hesitated between it and the Corpse Golem when I bought new Essences. But...
“Amelia, if I remove this, my Magic Resistance will drop, making me vulnerable to magic..."
Initially, I’d resisted losing the [Leap] skill, my only means of mobility. However, the real problem wasn’t that. It was the absence of Magic Resistance. My tanking capabilities would be significantly compromised until I obtained the essence of Bellarios. 
‘But I can’t erase the Stormgush either.’
Stormgush was a third-grade essence. I’d have to get rid of it eventually, though… 
‘At least I should clear the Submerged Isle event first. I can just breeze through it with this essence.’
And, as a side note, the second core essence, after [Giant], comes from there.
‘…Ugh, what should I do?’
My anxieties deepened. It seemed I had two options: abandon the essence or abandon the disguise. 
While the royal family’s actions raised suspicions, there might not be a big problem in clearing my demonic possession accusation. Surely they wouldn’t—
“By the way, I didn’t say anything since you probably know this, but if it’s proven you’re not a demon, the royal family won’t be pleased.”
“...Huh?”
“Why that expression? It’s the same as admitting that their flawless reputation is tarnished.”
Ugh, this is such a tough decision.
Struggling to decide, I sought advice from Erwen and Amelia.
“What do you two think is best?”
“I… think it’s better to hide if possible.”
Erwen, unsurprisingly, was in favor of keeping the essence.
“Why?”
“...I just feel it.”
Ah, so it’s a gut feeling, then.
Turning to Amelia, I asked for her thoughts.
“I agree with Tersia.”
“Why?”
“It’s not like regaining my name would be a huge benefit in the current situation.”
Benefit? It would let me keep the essence.
I was about to argue, but Amelia continued.
“You don’t seriously think your former companions will immediately return after all this time, do you?”
Erwen nodded in agreement.
“Definitely. Even if Ainhar does come back, Aruah Raven probably won’t, even if she heard about your survival. She’s part of the royal family’s military.”
I’d imagine the situation is similar with Bear Uncle. It would be hard for him to leave the clan, now that he’s joined. As for Misha, I only know that she’s become Baekho’s companion. No other information.
‘The girls are right, I guess.’
I paused the conversation and carefully weighed the pros and cons of both choices. 
It didn’t take long.
‘The information from the Round Table said the royal family would soon issue a conscription order to the nobles.’
Most will send their private armies, but I, a former explorer, won’t have that luxury. I’ll be forced to join the war immediately and follow orders. 
I made my decision.
“I’ll… erase the essence.”
My jump key…
***
The essence was settled, so it was time for the next item on the agenda. If I was going to consume an essence, what kind would be best?
The more I spoke with them, the more I noticed a common thread in their recommendations.
“An Imp Essence might be good. It provides a bit of Magic Resistance.”
“But that’s a seventh-grade essence, making it hard to find in the Exchange. A Dwarf-Eater Essence would be better. It increases bone density, just like Ainhar, and it would suit you perfectly.”
“Do we have enough to buy a fourth-grade essence? Maybe an Alt-Smoler would be better. It’s a fifth-grade essence.”
“Ah, Alt-Smoler? That’s not good. It has serious side effects...”
“Side effects?”
Erwen glanced at me and whispered something to Amelia. I couldn’t hear the details, but Amelia looked at me and said, ‘Maybe,’ then stopped talking.
‘Why are they so interested in my essence situation?’
I chuckled and cut their conversation short.
“Stop. I’ve already decided.”
I’d chosen the essence that offered the best stats and skills out of the options that allowed me to shrink my body. I even had a third choice in mind.
“Erwen, check how much you can borrow from the bank against our house tomorrow. Amelia, check if the Exchange has the essence I mentioned.”
“Got it.”
“Let’s eat something. I’m starving.”
The conversation ended, and we shared the dinner Erwen had brought back. 
Then...
“...You’re going to stay here from now on?”
“There are plenty of spare rooms. What’s the problem?”
“Professional and personal life should be separated.”
“Ugh, stop it. I’m tired. Just let’s sleep. Amelia, take any of the spare rooms.”
There was a bit of a mishap when Amelia, whom I thought had gone back to her lodgings, came back in the middle of the night with her luggage. But it didn’t escalate into a major issue. 
The day ended, somewhat awkwardly.
“Uncle! I’ll be back!”
From the next day onwards, Erwen and Amelia went out to fulfill their respective roles, and I spent my days in seclusion within the gloomy house. To put it simply, I slept.
Luckily, the loan against our house was approved within three days, and I used the money to reclaim Kraul’s Demon Smasher from the bank. 
“...Really? You’re that happy about it?”
Of course I am. This is my number one treasure from now on.
「Character has equipped Kraul’s Demon Smasher (No. 87).」
「Total item level has increased by +4,800.」
That wasn’t the only good news. The essence I’d been searching for was put up for sale on the Exchange. Not my first choice, but it was my second. And honestly, there wasn’t much difference between the two, and I wouldn’t be using it for long anyway.
‘The price is reasonable, too.’
I used almost all the money left after reclaiming the Demon Smasher to purchase the essence. I’d already ordered a shield from Erwen for the dungeon, and I planned to buy the rest of the equipment cheaply using first-tier materials. There shouldn’t be any major expenses in the future.
…Except for one.
‘Please, let no one recognize me.’
With the essence purchased, I visited the temple the next day. It was the Tobera sect, one of the three deities’ religions. I was wary of visiting the temple of Rea-Tlaas so often.
“We’ll attract more attention if we go in together.”
“See you later...”
“Don’t do anything stupid to attract attention.”
It wasn’t a main temple with easy access, but a small temple located on the outskirts of the city, frequented by 90% regular citizens. Still, I had to show my face to erase the essence, so I was quite anxious…
“Heh, for a human, you’re quite well-built. You would have been a great knight.”
Thankfully, the old priest who was in charge of the essence removal didn’t recognize me.
「[Manticore Essence] embedded in the character’s soul has been removed.」
「Obtains a portion of the ability permanently acquired through passive skill [Inheritance].」
The essence removal, something I’d been worried about, went smoothly. I paid double the price I’d paid last time I erased an essence and quickly left the temple to return home.
I then opened the vial I’d purchased.
「[Gachapon Essence] has embedded itself in the character’s soul.」
A sixth-grade Undead Gachapon Essence. The basic stats were simple.
「Perception has increased by +40.」
「Physical Resistance has increased by +15.」
「Darkness Resistance has increased by +30.」
「Accuracy has increased by +45.」
Stats that are ambiguous for certain classes. On top of that...
「Bone density has increased by +110.」
Bone density stats to transform me into a human physique.
Lastly, there’s a penalty attached.
「Luck has decreased by -50.」
「Control has decreased by -30.」
Luck is a stat that increases the chance of random factors like critical hit probability. Control is a stat that provides a bonus to mental magic and counteracting status effects like fear.
Oh, well. It’s decreased, so it’ll have the opposite effect now.
“Oh.”
“Whoa...”
The two of them made a surprised sound as the essence absorption finished. I felt even more awkward than them.
We’re about the same height now. Amelia was about 170 centimeters tall. So I’m down to about 180 centimeters, right?
As I was thinking about it, Erwen averted her gaze.
“...Is it that weird?”
“No, no. It’s not that. It’s just...”
“Is it?”
“It, it’s just… I think you should see it for yourself...”
Erwen pointed to the mirror, and I adjusted my loose pants as I moved in front of it. 
However, there was no longer a sturdy Barbarian warrior standing there. Just a man with a handsome face, that’s all.
“...This is me?”
I finally understood why Ainhar had been so gloomy back then. 
I look so weak. Like I would break if I got hit with a hammer.
***
‘Maybe I should erase this essence again?’
My reflection in the mirror was awful, enough to make me consider it. No wonder Erwen looked away and trailed off.
“Um… Uncle, why are you doing that? Why are your shoulders slumped?”
As I was sulking, Erwen asked me why. I answered honestly.
With this face, how can I even go outside? Just look at Erwen. She can’t even look at me properly—
“No, no? It’s a misunderstanding! I was just avoiding eye contact, not because of that!”
“Huh? You say you weren’t avoiding my gaze because you were holding back laughter at my pitiful appearance?”
“No! Of course not!!”
“Then why were you doing that?”
When I asked back, Erwen quietly answered in a bashful tone.
“You’re… handsome…”
“What?”
So even she has common tastes. 
Was she really obsessed with me when I was a Barbarian because she thought of me as a protector, not because she had romantic feelings?
I decided to ask Amelia to get a second opinion.
“Do you think the same?”
“I don’t know...”
Amelia stared intently at my face, then chuckled and turned away.
“Well, it’s nice not having to look up when I talk to you.”
Surprisingly, none of my companions had a negative opinion of my current appearance. Had I been too attached to my Barbarian body?
‘…Come to think of it, I guess I’m actually a handsome man by modern standards.’
Of course, I still don’t want to stay like this. The [Giant] skill uses my base physique as a starting point. This small frame wouldn’t be efficient.
“Okay, let’s test out this ability. Can you help me with it?”
I couldn’t stay gloomy about my shrunken body forever. Time to get back to work. The first thing was practicing my skills.
‘It’s a bit awkward going out to the yard in broad daylight. I’ll just practice in the living room.’
“Yes, I will. What should I do?”
“Hit me. Use spirits or abilities.”
“………Okay?”
Um… does she not know about the passive effect of this essence?
It seemed like she didn’t, so I briefly explained the passive skill.
(P) Probabilistic Retaliation – When receiving damage that uses resources, there is a chance to ignore the damage and reflect it back.
Magic, divine power, spirits, anything that uses resources is affected by this passive skill.
Actually, this skill was the main reason I chose this essence. 
It won’t be enough to make up for my reduced Magic Resistance, of course. But this is the only essence with this level of performance at this price. 
My top choice was a different color of this very essence, too. 
‘Anyway, the chance was about 10%, right…?’
It’s with my decreased Luck stat applied, by the way.
Well, it might vary a bit depending on my original Luck stat, but it shouldn’t be much of a difference. 
“Um… I’ll do it then?”
After the explanation, Erwen summoned her spirits and started attacking me. 
And...
「Character has received Frost damage.」
「Character has received Frost damage.」
「Character has received Frost d… 」
「… 」
Huh?
“Erwen, change the element.”
“Yes!”
「Character has received Fire damage.」
「Character has received Fire damage.」
「Character has received Fire d… 」
「… 」
What?
“Wait! Amelia, try it.”
“If you want me to. Now you’re just the right height.”
「Character has been hit by [Suragak].」
「Character has been hit by [Suragak].」
「Character has been hit by [Su… 」
No, what? Seriously, what’s going on?
“Ugh! S, stop!”
Why won’t this thing activate?
