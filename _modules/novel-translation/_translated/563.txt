## Destination (3)
A creature with blue skin and large eyes, standing an average of three meters tall. A being of unknown species who calls itself "human." They stood in a standoff with real humans, a dense thicket serving as the dividing line.
"Are those the ones the Baron mentioned...?” 
“But why aren’t they coming any closer? What are they waiting for?”
Their faces were taut with tension, holding their weapons tightly, seemingly not fazed by the number of human soldiers – a force that rivaled our own expedition team.
And in the midst of this tense standoff...
“It’s been a while, Bjorn, son of Jandel.”
The village headman emerged from the midst of the creatures. Those who had never seen him before were astonished to hear him speak human language. I strode past them, moving toward the headman.
“Indeed, it has been a while.”
“Your companions have increased in number since our last encounter?”
“Ah, things happen, you know.”
He seemed to want to converse, so I offered a vague reply, casting my gaze around. The expedition force, spread out like a net around the village entrance, was converging on this spot. Yet, despite this obvious threat, the headman showed no concern.
“Why is he so relaxed?” 
This nonchalant greeting only increased my unease. However, I kept my apprehension concealed, and spoke.
“Where did you lot come from, anyway?  You told me there was only one entrance to the village.”
“Don’t be so hard on me.  I can’t tell an outsider everything about the village, can I?”
“Like the corpse in that basement?”
The headman didn't answer my probing question.  He merely cast a chilling glance over me, from head to toe, before asking,
“Do you know?  It’s said that those who are truly perceptive pretend to be oblivious.”
“…”
“Which one are you, Bjorn?”
I didn’t know the answer, but seeing him with those wild eyes was unnerving.  I almost swung my hammer in reflex.
“Baron! Retreat!”
The expedition commander, Jerome Saint-Tread, arrived, his presence drawing the headman’s gaze. 
“Hmm… who are you?”
“Jerome Saint-Tread, Earl and commander of the First Royal Knights.  I have been appointed as the commander of this expedition.”
“Royal… I knew you would come eventually—.”
“Now it’s your turn. I hear you introduced yourself to Baron Jandel as Cornelius Bruengrid, the Dragon Knight.  Is that true?”
Jerome cut him off, his tone demanding.  The headman stared intently at him, responding,
“Does it matter?”
“It does. It will determine whether you are an unidentified entity with whom we can communicate, or an ancient traitor to be executed.”
Ancient traitor? What’s he talking about?
I was puzzled, and as I tilted my head in confusion, the headman's gaze, usually stoic, flashed with a cold, sharp light.  It was as if I had struck a nerve. 
“Execution… interesting.  What a funny thing to say.”
“Interesting?  Strange.  My acquaintances always call me a boring person.”
“Even after all this time, those on your side haven’t changed.  They are so arrogant.  They act as if they stand above the world.”
The headman continued in a cold voice, 
“Go ahead.  Try that execution.”
“Well, even if you want it, the execution won’t happen here.”
“Why, are you starting to get scared now—.”
“There are many things I need to hear from you. After questioning and extracting all the information, I will personally carry out the execution I couldn’t finish.”
“…”
The situation was resolved in a flash. It was like frying beans in a lightning bolt. Even I, an observer, was taken aback.
“Well, at least they’re not on friendly terms. That’s a good thing…”
When running simulations, I had considered the possibility of them joining forces and targeting me.  This current scenario was relatively good.  But… 
“Eliminate them all!  Except for the leader, you can kill anyone you want!”
“Nia Lapdonia!”
What is going on now?
[Everyone scatters down to the village!]
As soon as the order for a full assault was given, the creatures scattered, fleeing in all directions.
***
“Commander!  The monsters are escaping!”
“Pursue and eliminate them!  Capture the leader at all costs.  Kill him if necessary!”
Should we really be chasing them?  The question crossed my mind, but it wasn’t something I could stop.  Nor did I have any reason to.
“Don’t stray from my side!”
I formed a mobile formation with my squad members and hastily joined the pursuit, mimicking the chase but not going full force. This was suspicious, even to the blind.
“…Jandel, there’s a possibility this is a trap.”
“I know.  It’s undoubtedly a lure.”
Jerome wouldn’t be unaware of this either.  He probably concluded that he couldn’t let them escape. He probably also has the confidence to overcome the trap with force.  Yes, so… 
“What are we going to do?”
Amelia asked, and I answered without hesitation, 
“We’ll detach ourselves from the main force as naturally as possible.”
A clear instruction for our future actions.  But it seemed she didn’t fully understand, as the response came after a few seconds of silence.
“…What do you mean, detach ourselves?”
“Just what I said.  We will discreetly separate ourselves from the main force while we are chasing them.”
“And then?”
“We’ll escape the island, of course.  Quite by accident, you know, during our pursuit.”
“Do you…  really think that’s possible?”
Even though the subject was missing, I understood the meaning immediately.  She was asking if I thought we could get away with deserting, and what the consequences would be. But what could I do?
“…Following them is too risky.”
Erwen was already in a single-braid state before we even got rid of Jerome.  Now the headman has also appeared, hinting at something big happening.  Should I just stay put and watch how it unfolds?
‘Yes, this is the right move.’
I cast aside my last remaining doubts and hardened my resolve. It’s not like I would have ever done this in my previous life.  This alone could significantly twist fate, allowing me to avoid the events that Parav witnessed.  Therefore… 
“It’s the headman!  The headman!  He went that way!  Squad Four, follow me!”
I seized a suitable moment and led my squad away from the main force. 
“What?  He clearly went that way—.”
“Don’t you believe me?  Follow me!”
The Squad Four members, who had no idea about my plan, looked unsure if this was acceptable, but thankfully followed my orders.
Thud, thud, thud-
The distance between us and the main force was growing rapidly.
“Huh? The Baron is going that way… .”
“But isn’t there nothing there?”
“But he said he saw something… .”
The nearby Squad Three watched us, their expressions reflecting their uncertainty about how to respond, but they didn’t attempt to stop us.  Of course, no one would expect me to lead my team to desert at this point.
“He went that way?  Change course!”
…Huh?
“The entire force will follow Baron Jandel!”
What the hell is going on? Why are they following me?  Just when I thought I had successfully escaped the main force, they changed direction and headed toward us.  As a result, I was suddenly leading the charge. 
“Jandel, what now?”
“Just act natural.”
“…Got it.”
Changing course now would only result in them following behind.  I was desperately trying to figure out why this happened as I ran, but then Jerome suddenly caught up to me, running alongside Squad One. 
“Baron! I’m following your lead, but are you sure that was correct?”
I was cornered.
“Uh… .”
What should I say? 
As I wrestled with this question, ignoring everything and focusing on running, I heard…
“Headman, he clearly went that way—.”
“Commander!  There he is!  The one we missed, he’s right there!”
For some reason, the headman was at the end of the path I was following.
“No way… were we being led to a trap?”
“…”
“Incredible! If not for Baron Jandel, we might have lost him!  I will never forget this service!”
“…Right, thanks.”
Should I be glad that I didn’t have to make excuses, or should I consider this a complete disaster?  I wasn’t sure.  But soon the headman stopped in front of a tree and slipped through a gap beneath it.
“There’s a path going down!”
It seemed this was another entrance leading to the village.
“Earl Saint-Tread, what are we going to do?  There’s a high possibility of a trap behind that.”
“I know, but we can’t let him escape.”
Hmm, so he’s really going down.  Well, whatever. Maybe if I let them go down there, another escape route will open up.
“So, Baron Jandel.”
“…”
“Would you mind leading the way down?”
“…I don’t know what’s down there.”
“Exactly, that’s why we need your strength.  You can hold your own against a Tier One monster, right? If you hold on for a while, our troops will quickly follow you.”
Jerome’s words made sense.  I’m the strongest among the entire expedition force.  It’s only natural that the commander would send me in first to the most dangerous location.  But… 
Thump-
My heart sank upon hearing his request.  Simultaneously, my vision, narrowed by the confusing situation, cleared, allowing me to see Jerome’s face clearly.  His expression was that of a soldier, no different from any other day.
Thump-
But why?
Suddenly, a few specific scenes from today merged in my mind.  Individually they were insignificant, but…
‘I need to verify this.’
I locked eyes with Jerome and spoke, 
“Fine, I’ll lead the way.”
“Oh, good! If you refused, I was wondering who I should send—.”
“But before that, allow me to confirm one thing.”
I cut him off, adding a condition.  Jerome closed his mouth tightly and stared at me, as if silently asking me to just tell him what I wanted.  So, I went straight for it.
“I heard that you brought ‘Disrupted Trust’ with you.  Is that true?”
“…That’s right, but?”
“If you use it to confirm a few things, I will lead the way down right now.”
“I don’t know what you want to confirm, but do we have to do it now?  That guy might be preparing some kind of ambush down—.”
“Then that’s it. I won’t lead the way.”
“Even if I use my authority as the commander to order you to?”
I shrugged in response, refusing to say another word.
“…”
“…”
A silence settled between us.
“…The atmosphere between you two seems a little odd.  Am I the only one who feels this way?”
“Pnellin, Kalstain, Tersia.  Prepare yourselves.”
“Pr, prepare ourselves?”
“Whatever it is, just do as you’re told.”
The silence was so heavy, everyone present felt it at once.  In that silence, Jerome finally made his choice. 
“Very well.  Evost, bring ‘Disrupted Trust’!  I don’t know what the Baron wants to confirm, but it seems he has something in mind!”
The deputy commander swiftly retrieved the item, and I grabbed it immediately, activating it.
Click.
Well, with that, all preparations are complete.  No one within ten meters can lie to me now.  So…
“Your name is Jerome Saint-Tread, correct?”
“That’s right.”
I started with a simple test question, then moved onto the main topic. 
“I’m about to ask you a few questions.  From now on, you will answer ‘no’ to every question I ask.”
“Easy enough.  Go ahead.”
I stared at his unwavering gaze, barely a flicker of doubt, and slowly began to speak.
“Not today.”
“…”
“No, to be precise, excluding what happened just now.”
“…”
“Have you ever met that monster who claimed to be Cornelius Bruengrid?”
The answer I wanted was ‘no.’  But no matter how long I waited, the answer I longed for never came.
Whoosh.
I stood face to face with him, gently lifting my shield and hammer.  After a long silence, a deep voice echoed. 
Very quietly.
“How did you know?”
…Damn it.
He has met the headman before today.
