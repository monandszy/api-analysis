## Chapter 592: Boss Rush (5)
The 5th floor unique rift, the Fortress of Souls.  And in this place, the maze-like boss monster guarding the rift, the “Soul Keeper Hausiel," awaited us.
Truthfully, its second phase wasn’t that dangerous. It usually takes around 500 chests to find the Rift Stone and move on, though the exact number varies depending on the character's luck stat. 
But…
“There’s no guarantee I’ll be that lucky, either.” 
That’s why I brought Sven Parab with me. This rift wasn’t about finding gold. It was about avoiding the bad stuff.  As I saw it, he had a knack for avoiding misfortune.
“Which is why I wasn’t expecting this… ”
What the hell was this? Was this some kind of prank?  My mind went blank as I stared at the chest glowing with a brilliant golden light.
“Sven Parab...”
“Yes? Oh, yes, Baron.”
“Did you feel anything strange before opening the chest?”
“No…? It felt exactly the same as usual… ”
Ugh, so it really was just good luck? It didn’t make sense, even after thinking it through.  A character with the ability to sense misfortune, blessed with inherent luck?  This felt like we needed to add a new Number Item to this world's lore.  
A fitting name would be...
Parab's Golden Goblin’s Charm.
The Number would be 7777. Or maybe even a single digit Number less than ten.  That’s what it would take to balance things out.
“Um… but what is this?”
His question brought me back to reality.  He stood a few steps away from the chest, his eyes wide with caution, his face innocently gazing at me.  I wanted to give him a kiss, but I quickly dismissed the thought.  A small misunderstanding could easily escalate into something bigger.
“It’s a chest you can find with an extremely low probability when conquering Hausiel.”
“Is it good?”  
Typical of an explorer.
“It’s good. Very good.”  
The moment I gave a decisive answer, his gaze changed.  He looked at the chest with a mixture of curiosity and greed.  He seemed to be wondering what could possibly be inside that would make me react this way.  
“But this probably won’t be that appealing to him.”
The value of an item depends on the person.  For some, it could be more valuable than a single digit Number, while for others, it could be completely useless. 
Parab, the Paladin, fell into the latter category.
With a swift motion, I reached into the chest, still radiating light, and felt a round object in my grasp.
“…What’s it for?”
I smirked and explained its purpose. I had to act like a local, so I couldn’t simply say, “Experience Potion.”  I had to elaborate, using words like “merit points.”  
But really, it could be explained in five characters.
“Experience Potion.”
I was now level 11.
***
「The character has consumed the ‘Dreaming Soul’.」
「Reaching level 10 grants 10,000 EXP.」
***
Dreaming Soul.  An extremely rare item only obtainable during the boss fight against Hausiel, the Soul Keeper.  It was essential for reaching level 11, which was essentially the max level in the original mode.  
You needed an additional 14,000 experience points to reach level 11, even after defeating all kinds of monsters.  
You could defeat monsters, but it was almost impossible to reach that level just by running through portals and rifts.
“I… I actually got it like this.”
Honestly, I was still in shock.  It was incredibly rare to find.  
Even in my last playthrough, where I had opened the Gate of the Abyss, I only reached level 10.  
Of course, the early parts were easy, and I was able to fully equip myself with gear and essences.
Anyway…
“… ”
I gulped down the potion in one go and glanced to my side.  Parab looked glum, his shoulders drooping.  I could understand why.  
It was like finding out you won the lottery but then discovering it was for the previous drawing.  Anyone would feel cheated. 
But his reaction after that surprised me.
“It’s still a good thing.  It means the Baron will be able to climb even higher.” 
It was clear he meant it.  He seemed slightly disappointed, but there was no envy or jealousy at all.
“Haha, don’t look at me like that. This is useless to me anyway.  You said I couldn’t take it out, even if I used a distortion spell, right?”
“That’s true, but… ”
He was right.  He was kind enough to say that, making me feel even more indebted to him.  I’ll have to return the favor when I get the chance. 
“Let’s move now.”
The longer we lingered, the harder the boss fight would be.  We packed up and resumed our search.  As we continued opening chests and chatting, I learned more about Sven Parab's intuition.
“It seems his ability only activates when it’s truly dangerous.  He doesn’t react to weak curses or monster chests.” 
That alone was close to a divine power… or perhaps even a true divine power. 
He’d actually received an oracle recently.
“Ah, I think I found it.”
After a long search, we found the chest containing the Rift Stone, allowing us to progress to the next phase.
Clack-!
The space we were transported to was like a solidified version of a giant earthworm’s insides.
Thump-!
The floor was slippery yet squishy, and it wriggled periodically, like a living creature. 
Also…
「The Soul Keeper Hausiel’s [Defense System] is becoming more robust.」
Sticky liquid began to seep from the ceiling, floor, and walls.
“We need to move quickly before it fills up completely.”
We moved faster than ever before to continue the 3rd phase.  Even the best tank needs to breathe. 
In the game, if the liquid filled up, it was game over.  Of course, after completing the map, I’ve never been wiped out here. 
“Go straight, then turn left at the fork. Two more straight paths, then turn right… ”
I hadn’t memorized the entire map, but I knew the route to the Rift Stone perfectly.
Thump, thump.
We crushed the monsters blocking our way, rushing over the acidic liquid that had risen to our calves.  Soon, we reached our destination.
Thump-!
A heart-shaped Rift Stone pulsing with life.  Without hesitation, I swung my hammer with all my might and smashed it to pieces.
And…
Whoooooosh…!
The grand finale. The final phase.
When we opened our eyes, we were greeted by a space reminiscent of the cosmos.  A pyramid-shaped staircase, transparent like glass, stood in the center, and a giant eye-shaped Rift Stone floated at the top.
The Soul Keeper Hausiel’s true form.
“No dialogue this time either.”
The moment we arrived, my eyes shot open, and monsters began pouring out, like in the basement of the 1st floor during the Rainy Season.
Hundreds of monsters, a horde that wouldn't be out of place in an army. 
「The Soul Keeper Hausiel’s [Defense System] is becoming more robust.」
At least we arrived early, and we opened the golden chest in the middle, so the monsters themselves weren’t that high-level.
“Maximum level 4?” 
Oh, by the way, if you arrive with your experience points depleted, monsters up to level 2 might appear.  
And the main body’s power becomes even stronger.
“Move!”
We climbed the stairs before the monsters descended.  The moment we made contact, we fought fiercely to clear a path. 
It wasn’t easy with just the two of us, though it would have been much easier with a mage who could use area-of-effect spells. 
But what can you do?  
“Behel—laaaaaaa!!!”
We climbed the stairs, engaged in a fierce battle.  Honestly, the main body was more annoying than the monsters.
Booom-!
The magic cannon targeting me was one thing.
「The Soul Keeper Hausiel casts [Target Designation].」
The aggro periodically dropped, so my companions behind me needed to be able to withstand waves of monsters.  
And in the midst of all that...
Whoooooosh-!
Every time the main body released its periodic waves, my body, even with [Gigantification] activated, was pushed back.
“What are you all standing around for!  I’ll clear a path, so get your asses up here! Don’t act like a bunch of morons!”
“Yes, yes…!”
I spoke more strongly than usual, but I had no choice.  Being knocked back or pushed off the stairs by monsters meant instant death.  
I could probably take on the boss alone, but I needed to stubbornly climb the stairs until then.
Boosh! Boosh! Boosh-!
I swung my hammer haphazardly, knocking the monsters aside.  Most lost their balance and rolled down the stairs, but the unlucky ones continued rolling down into the endless darkness below.
There were just too many of them, though.
“...Damn it.”
As we climbed through the melee, the distance between Sven Parab and me widened.  Soon, we were separated by a mass of monsters.  
“It’d be faster to take down the main body than to go rescue him.”
My brain, soaked in years of gaming, made the most logical decision, devoid of emotion.  The monster horde was troublesome, but defeating the main body wouldn’t be difficult if I could get close enough.  
But even so, he was my companion, so it felt like the right thing to do.
“I’ll hold on!  Go ahead…!”
He yelled from his position, allowing me to move forward without hesitation.
And…
「The character casts [Swing].」
「The character casts [Swing].」
「The character casts [Swing]… 」
Reaching the main body, I swung my hammer like a madman.  
Even though it was a weak main body, it still took hundreds of swings for a tank barbarian to deal enough damage… 
Clack-!
The giant Rift Stone shattered into tens of thousands of pieces, scattering everywhere.  
And…
「The Soul Keeper Hausiel has been defeated. EXP +6.」
「Boss Defeat Bonus. EXP +3.」
The monster horde, exceeding a thousand, all turned into light and scattered, bathing the entire space in light.  I quickly searched for Parab.
“Ugh… ”
He had rolled down to the middle of the stairs, gasping for breath, his body a mess.
“I… I’m alive…”
Ugh, I’ll have to take better care of him in the future.
***
The portal opened with the boss fight’s end.  
A rainbow-colored essence also dropped.
“Ugh…  I have to throw this away.”
Words couldn’t express how much it pained me.  It was a valuable essence, all thanks to a single passive skill. 
[Soul Contract].
This passive skill had a simple effect.  
You instantly reach level 8, but you can no longer gain experience. 
An essence you couldn’t possibly consume if you wanted to reach higher levels. 
But this essence sold for a lot of money. 
There was a famous story from a few years ago about how a Count bought this essence for tens of billions of stones.
“Apparently, his wife consumed it and filled all seven essence slots with beauty-related essences… ”
It was a ridiculous situation, but this kind of thing happened every day.
“I’ve earned enough here anyway, so getting out is my priority… ”
I finally gave up on my greed and entered the portal with Parab.  Normally, everyone would come running to me, asking if I was hurt, but this time it was different.
“… ”
“… ”
In the silence, everyone around the statue was staring at a single point.  I turned my head and looked at what they were staring at. 
“It’s already open…”
Was it because we lingered after defeating the boss?  The stone gate, once closed, now stood wide open, revealing what was hidden within. 
“Portal…?”
A red portal, sinister just by looking at it.
A familiar mage muttered, watching the portal.
“It’s not an ordinary portal. This magic wave… ”
“…?”
“It’s a rift!  It’s a rift!”
The rift from the 1st floor had opened.
