## Outsider (4)
The GM, Yurben Havelion. A player with the incredibly cringe-worthy nickname Elfnunalove, and an old user who has survived in this world for at least 20 years. Incidentally, even Versil knows this guy's identity. 
“[Yurben Havelion. That's the GM's name.]”
It was something he revealed at the Round Table, after all. 
Therefore, I suspect there’s another reason for Versil’s recommendation that he hasn’t revealed.
“ …If he’s a magitechnologist, I know him too. But realistically, is it even possible to call him out? I heard he rarely ventures outside.”
Versil nodded, unconcerned about Amelia’s sharp question. 
“Don't worry about that. I have connections.”
“Of course, it’s not guaranteed,” he added, hedging his bets, but I could sense the confidence in his voice. 
So, why was he so confident?
The answer was simple. 
There’s no way Versil could have any connections with a reclusive GM like that.
“He must be relying on some weakness he holds over him.”
I doubt he’ll succeed by simply threatening him with his identity. From what I've seen, the royal family knows his identity too. 
Maybe they have a mutually beneficial relationship where they use each other?
“Now that the community is gone, I’m curious to see what situation he’s in.”
I’ve been curious about him for a while, but I was hesitant to approach him. 
Should I call it a lack of justification? 
There’s no way I could just go to him, considering he’s always stuck in the tower, and he wouldn’t even bother to meet me. On top of that, I'd seem suspicious if I suddenly showed up, without any explanation.
However…
“Not bad. Let’s get this done.”
If Versil acts as a bridge, I could meet him naturally. 
“Yes, I’ll bring it up right away when I get back.”
There are still parts that worry me, but I trust Versil’s personality; he’ll blackmail him effectively without revealing his own identity.
“This has to be kept a secret outside, so make sure to emphasize that. If he agrees to help, schedule a meeting. I need to see him first.”
“Yes, I will.”
“Well, I'll be heading back then.”
There’s nothing left to do here, so I decided to end my journey for the day and return to the city. 
And…
“I’ll head to the Mage Tower.”
Versil went ahead and left to talk to the magitechnologist. Three days later…
“It’s settled. The magitechnologist is willing to meet.”
The meeting was scheduled.
***
Meeting the magitechnologist was a very cautious and secretive affair. It was as if I was a spy in the Cold War.
“Turn left here, then go to the third door next to the red-roofed building in front of you, and go down. Ah, here it is.”
After walking through a maze of alleyways, I arrived at the building. 
From there, I went down another set of stairs, entered a magical circle as I would in a black market, and entered the mysterious space.
Flash-!
A spacious room decorated in the form of a study. 
However, there was no entrance, nor a single window to be found. 
It seemed like a special space that could only be accessed by magic…
“You’ve arrived. I’ve been waiting for you, Baron.”
The man sitting on the sofa got up and greeted me. 
“So, that’s what you look like.”
I’d met him once before in the city, but he was disguised as Hans I then, so this was my first time seeing his face.
First impression keywords: young, skinny, glasses. 
But I wasn’t here for a beauty contest, so I just memorized his face and started the conversation right away.
“ …Why all this secrecy?”
“I apologize for the inconvenience. But lately, there are many enemies around me. Please understand.”
Enemies…
Come to think of it, Baekho was obsessed with finding him.
“Anyway, nice to meet you. Yurben Hamelion. I’m Bjorn, son of Yandel.”
After a brief handshake, I sat on the sofa opposite him—
*Crack!*
Ugh, so much for being treated like a Barbarian from the start. 
“It’s fine, no need to apologize—.”
…Wait?
Why am I apologizing?
“Get a sturdier chair next time. If you buy chairs like this, you’ll look like a racist.”
“Excuse me…? Oh, yes…”
“Buying chairs that Barbarians can’t sit on is the first step towards discrimination.”
“…Haha, I'll be sure to keep that in mind.”
I could see his impression of me falling in real-time, but I had no choice.
I need to be extra careful when talking to this guy.
I need to act like a Barbarian, never giving away that I’m a modern person.
Even if it seems a bit excessive.
Thump.
I pushed the broken sofa aside and sat cross-legged directly on the floor.
Surprisingly, there was no height difference.
No, I think I’m even a little taller…
“Anyway, I’m grateful you agreed to help. I never imagined you would be connected to Versil. How did you two meet?”
To avoid suspicion, I act like I know nothing.
After all, wouldn’t it make sense to him if I thought this way?
That I’m the one who sent Versil to blackmail him.
“Haha… we’re both officially affiliated mages at the Mage Tower, you see? It’s just natural that we’d become acquainted.”
“Oh, really?”
“But… could you tell me what I need to investigate? Goulend didn't tell me that much.”
“It’s about the magic circle in the underground fortress. Well, to be precise, I want you to find out how to activate it.”
“The magic circle…? ”
“Yes. It’s an ancient magic circle, so Versil said it was beyond his abilities.”
As I honestly explained the situation, the GM rubbed his chin and fell into thought. Then, he cautiously asked me,
“Are… you trying to leave the city walls?”
…Ah, so you know something.
Since I was seeking his help anyway, I decided to be honest. 
“Yes. To be precise, I’m trying to go outside to keep an eye on those guys.”
“…I see.”
“Do you already know the activation method for that magic circle?”
“No, I don't. I just happened to hear about the existence of such a magic circle. But that’s all.”
“So, you can’t give me a definite answer until you see it yourself?”
“Yes, that's right.”
The GM nodded, his voice lacking any confidence. It even gave off a sense of apology.
However…
“Why does he keep setting the table?”
I got the feeling he was trying to get out of the situation easily, so I spoke in a kindly voice.
“Don't worry. Even if you can’t do it, I wouldn’t blame you at all.”
“Oh, yes… that makes me feel a little better.”
“It’s fine. We can just keep working on it until we succeed, right?”
“…Yes?”
Yes, what yes.
Is he just going to take a quick look at the magic circle underground and then claim he’s not qualified?
“It doesn’t matter how many months it takes. Eventually, we’ll succeed!”
“….”
“Since I’m asking for your help, it’s only right that I don’t leave you alone. I’ll stay here with you the whole time!”
He’s basically saying he’s going to keep me in a can and monitor me so I don’t leak information to others.
“Now that we’re on the topic, why don’t we go right now?”
“…Yes?”
“I heard you're always stuck in the tower anyway. You don't have any appointments later, do you?”
“Well, I’ll need to bring some equipment….”
“Don’t worry! If you just tell me what you need, I’ll have Versil bring it over.”
The GM’s voice sped up, as if he thought he might be dragged away.
“Hmm… you’re not trying to avoid going, are you?”
“…Yes?”
I burst out laughing at the guy’s dumbfounded expression. 
“Ha-ha-ha! Just kidding! Why would you avoid going? I’m not worried!”
“Ha-ha… oh, really?”
“Yes! Even if something unexpected happens and you can’t go, I’ll go and find you!”
“….”
After I told him I know the Mage Tower well since I’ve been there so many times, the GM’s face went white, remembering the last Mage Tower raid.
Then…
“Don’t worry. I can be ready in an hour.”
The GM left, and he truly returned in exactly an hour.
***
Going to Noark with just the GM was no problem.
I already knew the way down to Noark very well, and…
*Thud, thud.*
The knights patrolling the sewers were dealt with by a magical device he had.
The patrol team seemed to have a type of perception device, so I was a bit worried, but it turned out to be unnecessary.
“…He has some impressive gear.”
Is this what a magitechnologist is supposed to be?
His device seemed to be higher-level than what the knights possessed. Even as we walked right past them, the knights couldn’t detect anything.
“You said you made it yourself? What’s it called?”
“It doesn’t have a name… I never intended to sell it, you see.”
“Why not?”
“It requires a very rare byproduct to make, and the success rate is very low. That’s why only this one exists.”
“Oh, really?”
That makes it even more tempting.
I wonder if there’s any way I can steal it…
While I was mentally pondering the question, the GM, as if he sensed my desire, quickly changed the topic.
“The world’s really changed, hasn’t it? I never thought I’d see knights patrolling the sewers.”
“That’s why you should go outside more.”
“Haha… I should.”
I don’t know if it was because the seat was uncomfortable or because he was stressed about being outside, but the GM didn’t say anything until we reached the Noark Square.
Even when I tried to strike up a conversation, he’d just brush it off. 
“He’s much less fun than I thought.”
Well, it doesn’t matter what kind of personality he has as long as he does his job well.
“Alright, here it is. See if you can figure anything out.”
As we reached the square, the GM exuded an air of professionalism. He brought out various devices and fiddled with them.
How long had it been?
“Um….”
He approached me at a quick pace, making sure not to interrupt my observation.
“I’m… done, but.”
At first, I didn’t understand what he meant.
“…You’re done?”
“Yes. I’ve written the inscription to activate the magic circle on here, so you just need to follow these instructions. Even a 4th-grade mage can activate it.”
The GM handed me a parchment with elegant script, but it was hard to believe.
Is this really something that can be done so quickly?
I narrowed my eyes, suspicious, and scanned the parchment up and down. The GM, as if trying to defend himself, continued.
“…It was easier than I expected. Ancient magic circles are my specialty.”
“Then why couldn’t you give me a definite answer earlier?”
“It’s just… a bad habit of mine. I’m sorry.”
Well, I guess I have nothing to say about that…
“Um… now that we’re done, can I go back? I’m not really supposed to be out after dusk…”
To be honest, I don’t believe it.
Of course, I can’t say that directly to his face.
“What do you mean, we’re done? Haven’t you checked if it actually works? Try activating it.”
I pressed him with a reasonable explanation, and the GM couldn’t find a reason to refuse, so he sighed and nodded.
“Yes… I understand. I’ll just get things ready, so please wait.”
The GM, after tidying up his equipment, called me over to him five minutes later.
I approached him, and he started counting. One, two, three.
And…
Flash-!
A white light enveloped us. When I opened my eyes…
“This is….”
A space, both familiar and strange, filled my vision.
A circular tunnel, wide enough for a giant dragon to pass through. One wall was blocked by an unknown inscription…
“That’s the inscription on this side. It seems like the activation method is the same, at least at a glance.”
“…At a glance?”
“Uh, that’s an exaggeration. The information’s accurate, so don’t worry about that.”
“….”
“Oh, and one more thing. Be careful not to damage the inscription. Unlike the one in the square, this one is exposed….”
“What happens if it gets damaged?”
“It has a permanent restoration enchantment, so if you wait, it’ll fix itself. But… it will take at least a year.”
“…I see.”
It’s better than never being able to return, but a year is still a significant risk.
“Can’t we use teleportation magic to get back to the city?”
“Yes. The coordinate recognition is set to the city below, but the movement path is not set. This means it’s likely that our current location is outside the protection enchantment.”
In other words, we’re below the city, but outside the barrier that covers the whole city.
It’s still suspicious, you see.
Of course, I don’t doubt the truth of the information he’s giving me.
But…
“It’s still so shady….”
Yurben Havelion, the magitechnologist.
I know this guy’s a talented mage.
“But even so, how can he just take a quick look and know everything?”
Even I, as an outsider, could sense something was off.
It’s as if he already knew the answer and was pretending not to…
“I think my job’s done. Could I go back now?”
I hesitated a bit. I didn’t want to let him go just yet, even though he’d said he was done.
I’d been expecting him to be with me for a few weeks at least.
In fact, I’d been planning on continuing the investigation with him, having various conversations…
So…
“I’m here now, and you’re curious, right? Let’s go in together!”
“Yes?”
“Consider it granted!!”
I won’t let him get away that easily.
