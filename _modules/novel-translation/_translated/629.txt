## Chapter 629: Abandoned City (2)
The 14th district, the detention camp of Bifron. Originally classified as a city district of Ravigion, it’s now a restricted area, a place where even the Dimensional Plaza has vanished.
This place was once a potential escape route. We could have crossed the wall into Bifron, then escaped from there to the 4th district.
“But Bifron has an active protective magic circle, making it impossible to cross the wall by conventional means.”
“That’s not a problem. We can use the secret passage in the sewers, even with the magic circle, we can get in.”
“Is there such a thing…?”
“Yes. I was exiled here for twenty days once, and I discovered it by chance.”
It was Amelia who told me about the passage.
“Ah! That time! I remember! I was so worried… .”
Although we knew a way to Bifron, we didn’t choose this route. 
The sewers were swarming with soldiers.
Therefore, we decided that it was better to target the wall.
After all, if we were going to break through the sewers, it was more logical to head directly into the city instead of going through Bifron.
Most importantly, there were issues with Bifron itself.
“Bif, Bifron?”
“…It’s too unsettling to go there.”
“We don’t have the antidote, do we?”
We needed troops to execute the escape plan, but most explorers were extremely uncomfortable with Bifron itself.
I’d probably feel the same way if I had to go into a radioactive zone without a protective suit. 
“……I can’t really say there’s no witch's poison here.”
I know the area outside the wall is fine, but as a nobleman, I can’t tell them that. 
There’s a world of difference between rumors circulating and a nobleman officially confirming it. 
“…Well, if you think about it, it’s not completely nonexistent.”
The outside is fine.
But in Bifron, people die every day from the witch’s poison.
What’s going on?
‘The royal family must have been feeding or spreading the poison.’
In any case, the plan to go through Bifron was withdrawn for those reasons. 
But now the situation is different.
“Behel—laaaah!”
I charged through the sewer, bellowing a battle cry.
The ceiling was too low for me to use [Gigantification], so I couldn’t unleash my full power, but it wasn’t too much of an inconvenience.
The enemy was affected by the terrain just as much as I was.
Kaaaa-bang!
I couldn’t use destructive magic or abilities for fear of collapsing the passage.
Moreover, it wasn’t an open field, so I didn’t have to withstand dozens of attacks simultaneously.
For a Shield Barbarian with my level of stats, it was definitely something I could endure.
…Still, it’s a little annoying.
‘Hey, they said they wouldn’t stop us if we went to Bifron.’
Did that promise only apply to the soldiers stationed on the wall? Or was there a communication breakdown that prevented the message from being delivered?
I don’t know, but the soldiers stationed in the sewers attacked us relentlessly as soon as we went down.
“G, get out of the way! Keep your distance!”
“Aaah!”
I single-handedly cleared the path to the secret passage, but there were still casualties.
It was similar to the Crystal Cave on the first floor.
The sewers were like an ant's nest, with attacks coming from the sides and the rear, inevitably resulting in casualties among those following behind.
The current members are not like the elite individuals from the Ice Rock expedition.
It was nearly impossible for lower-ranked explorers who had operated below the third floor to survive a large-scale battle on their own.
Thump-thump.
I suddenly crave a cigarette, even though I’ve never smoked before. 
‘……I wonder how many died.’
There can be no casualties.
That’s how this savage world is.
But even though I understand that better than anyone, my heart always feels heavy when I make such a decision.
It’s all those Noark bastards who are bad.
I’ve done nothing wrong.
While thinking that, I couldn’t help but think.
‘……If I had just stayed and opened the path for them, they wouldn’t have died.’
Of course, I don’t regret my decision.
I just need to live harder from now on.
If I were a better person, I wouldn’t have had to give up anything.
Yes, so… .
Clank!
I pushed forward, my shield on my shoulder.
This was something I had done countless times over countless trials, but this time it felt different.
It’s almost too easy.
“…What?”
“Back! Go back……!!”
There was no way to stop me in a straight passage as long as I had the Shield of Aegis.
After all, how do you stop a Barbarian who can charge without taking any damage the moment his Guard is successful?
“Jandel! Stop!”
I finally stopped my charge after hearing Amelia’s cry.
“We’ve arrived.”
I was so focused on breaking through that I didn’t even notice we were there.
***
After reaching the entrance to the secret passage leading to Bifron, things got a lot easier. There were no soldiers waiting in the passage, and there were no pursuers chasing us.
Thanks to that, I was able to slow down and move more comfortably.
“What are the casualties so far?”
I received a casualty report from Versil, who was in charge of overall personnel management.
Of course, even Versil didn’t know the exact number of casualties.
But… .
“It seems that the casualties are most significant among explorers of rank 7 and below. Even though I tried to place them in relatively safe locations… .”
“I see.”
“Still, thanks to Jandel’s clearing the path, the casualties were kept to this level.”
Even the estimated numbers were enough to make me feel gloomy.
I should be numb to it by now.
Is this a sign of menopause? I find myself becoming increasingly unable to view those numbers as mere numbers.
“…Jandel, what are you thinking about?”
“Nothing.”
“…..”
Anyway, after moving through the secret passage for a while, I reached the Bifron sewer area.
And… .
“Jandel, there are people.”
As soon as I arrived in that sewer area, I encountered unfamiliar people.
Fortunately, they weren’t Noark troops.
“B, Boss?”
To my surprise, they were people I knew.
“Boss? You mean…?”
I immediately grabbed their hair and pulled it. Their wig came off, revealing a familiar man with a jellyfish-shaped haircut.
Their name is… .
“…Jingjing?”
“…Yes, yes! It’s me! Zinkasar Feljain! Boss’s loyal right-hand man!”
Right-hand man, but I don’t really know their real name.
It was the guy who served me when I stayed in Bifron a few years ago.
But it’s great to see a familiar face.
“So, what were you doing here all alone?”
“W, well, the atmosphere seemed strange. I was looking for a way to escape Bifron.”
Well, he knows about the secret passage because of me.
I told him it existed so he’d live right, so he could come here anytime, but I’ve never actually been back because of all the work I’ve had. 
Anyway, he must’ve remembered that and started looking for it on his own.
“You left all your subordinates behind?”
I narrowed my eyes in disdain, and Jingjing waved his hands in protest.
“No, no! That’s not true! I’ve changed a lot since then!”
Is that so?
His hair is definitely thinning more than before.
“Why would I want to live on my own? I don’t have much time left… . I was going to find the passage, go outside, and check on the situation.”
“Oh, so that’s how you’ve changed… .”
“…What? What are you implying… .”
“Forget it, I’ll ask you a few questions. Just answer them.”
I took advantage of meeting a local in the sewers to quickly check the city’s condition.
I thought the Noark bastards might have invaded here as well.
But… .
“Noark…? You mean… are those bastards responsible for all this chaos?”
Jingjing didn’t even know that this incident was caused by Noark.
Did the royal family not tell him anything?
“T, they suddenly started making a commotion and the soldiers locked the gate of the checkpoint, then told us to wait, but there’s been no contact since. But I keep hearing fighting noises from the direction of the wall… . People have been so uneasy because of it.”
Even for Bifron, that was too much.
If there’s a war, shouldn’t they tell people there’s a war?
“I see. So that’s why you said you were going outside to hear the news, not to escape.”
“Yes… . I didn’t know the situation outside was like that. N, Noark invaded…? H, how bad is it?”
“The 7th district and the 13th district have been taken by those bastards. We just barely managed to escape from the 7th district.”
“That’s… no way…!”
Jingjing’s jaw dropped at the news that two city districts had been taken, but I didn’t have time to wait for him to be shocked.
“Come with me. We’ll talk as we go.”
I continued moving while gathering information from Jingjing.
I asked everything, starting with whether there were any suspicious people around lately to how the city had changed since I left.
“Bifron, you say…? Ah! Yes, following the boss’s orders, we’ve been distributing supplies from the distribution center fairly. Adults and children alike. There’s no difference.”
“Good job.”
“The atmosphere has also changed a lot. If there’s any leftover from the distribution center, everyone asks the guards to exchange it for books.”
“Exchange it for books?”
“Yes… . Even if it’s not books, if they have skills, they share them with the children without holding back.”
“Why?”
“…We have to make sure the children can live in the city, right? We don’t have much time left… .”
I stopped and looked at Jingjing after hearing his words.
“…What’s your name?”
“Z, Zinkasar Feljain.”
“Zinkasar Feljain. You’ve changed a lot too.”
Jingjing was startled for a moment, hearing me call him by name for the first time, then gave me a wry smile.
“It’s been years… .”
“It has.”
“Yes… . Look at the boss, too. He became a Baron recently… . Ah! Here! If you go this way, you’ll be at the Plaza.”
After leaving the sewers through a shortcut known by the locals, I found myself facing a familiar yet strange sight of Bifron.
“….This place has changed a lot too.”
It’s become much cleaner, you could say?
Even this closed-off Dimensional Plaza was close to being a ruin when I came here before.
“Everyone has been working hard… .”
Jingjing said so, but it wasn’t hard to see that he was the one who worked hardest.
“Feljain!”
“Wow! It’s Feljain!”
“Feljain!! …Huh?”
The children playing in the Plaza greeted Jingjing enthusiastically.
…Well, that was before they saw me standing behind him, along with the hundreds of explorers from the 7th district.
“Don’t be scared! This man right here is Jandel’s son, Bjorn, the very same Baron Giant!”
Huh?
“Wow, really?”
“It’s the Baron Giant! The Baron Giant!”
“Wooooaaaah!”
It wasn’t a strange situation.
The children in the city loved both “big things” and “explorers.” After gaining fame, I was followed by those looks wherever I went in the city.
But… .
“Baron Giant! Thank you!”
It’s the first time I’ve heard something like that.
“Thank…?”
Jingjing, noticing my murmur, replied with an embarrassed expression.
“I’ve been telling the children a lot about the Boss. That he’s a hero who saved the city… .”
“You did something unnecessary.”
“Children need hope. Besides, it’s not a lie, is it?”
“….?”
“Bifron changed like this thanks to the Boss.”
“…Ahem.”
This guy keeps saying he’s changed but all he’s done is become a brown-noser.
He used to be terrible with flattery.
“All troops, halt!”
Now that I’d reached my destination, I started with a reorganization.
I had the injured lie down in the Plaza and receive treatment from the priests, and I asked those who could spare the time to investigate the surroundings.
And… .
“Feljain, you stay with me.”
I took Jingjing with me to the 4th district checkpoint.
As long as it wasn’t the occupied 13th district or the 7th district, we might be able to contact the city through here.
But… .
“….No one’s here.”
What’s going on?
I yelled and pounded on the wall, but there was no response.
I even revealed my name and status, thinking they might be ignoring us because they thought we were locals from Bifron, but it was still the same.
“This checkpoint has been closed for a long time… .”
“I know the checkpoint is usually closed.”
“But why… .”
Of course, because of the situation.
Even if the 4th district checkpoint is usually closed, shouldn’t they have someone stationed here in this situation?
“Whew…”
This is getting complicated.
I came here expecting to be able to use this checkpoint to get to a safe city district or make contact, but all my hopes were dashed.
‘There are so many things I don’t understand.’
Why is the royal family just leaving this place alone?
If I were the commander, I would have activated the 4th district checkpoint and immediately deployed troops to Bifron, maximizing the front line against the 7th and 13th districts.
‘…And what about those Noark bastards?’
Those guys are just as perplexing.
They occupied the 7th district but didn’t station any troops around Bifron.
As if the royal family was certain they wouldn’t attack that area.
“……”
However, as more questions arose, one thing became certain.
There’s a secret hidden here in Bifron that I don’t know about.
Yes, so… .
Thump, thump.
I need to find out what it is.
