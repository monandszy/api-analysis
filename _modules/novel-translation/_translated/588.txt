## The Boss Rush (1)
Knowledge is a valuable asset for an explorer. 
They never share their experiences or acquired information with others for free. 
Oh, of course, it doesn't mean they all have a stingy image. 
It's because this culture is prevalent in the explorer industry. 
The great navigator Peakma. 
The Abyss Searcher Rimenin. 
These renowned individuals are respected by all for a significant reason. 
They not only achieved great feats but also lived their lives dedicating themselves to the common good, generously sharing their own.
In that sense. 
"Now, we've entered, so let's briefly go over the guardian we'll be dealing with this time—." 
I cut off Raven's enthusiastic words as soon as we crossed the portal. 
"You don't have to explain." 
"Huh? You said you needed me earlier?" 
Raven seemed taken aback by my words. 
Could she have misunderstood and thought I needed her knowledge? 
Her shoulders, thin like anchovy bones, were already lifting up. 
"Raven, you're needed for a different reason." 
"………Why?" 
A somewhat sulky voice. 
But I knew at once she was trying to act annoyed, embarrassed. 
Well, she did look genuinely angry afterwards. 
"Isn't this an opportunity to get a 5th-floor guardian's essence? We need to put it in a vial." 
"…………What?" 
A frigid voice echoed after a long pause. 
I quickly added, as if to explain myself. 
"And among all the mages I know, you're the most trustworthy, Raven." 
"………What are you saying. Isn't it Bersil Goulend? You seem to be close to him, don't you? I heard he's almost like the vice-captain?" 
"But trusting someone enough to confide in them is different from trusting them enough to turn your back on them." 
"Hmm… Is that so?" 
Thankfully, Raven's expression softened again. 
It was truly a mystery. 
Other people can frown all they want, but why does Raven make me shiver? She's the shortest too.
While I was pondering such thoughts, Raven mumbled in a logical tone. 
"Come to think of it, it might be that way. Mr. Goulend doesn't know about your true identity, right? So, Mr. Yandel might have trouble acting freely around him." 
Well, one thing is certain. She'd definitely score a T on an MBTI test. 
"Unlike me." 
"………Huh?" 
"Nothing. I just said that. Don't think too hard. It's just… the truth, right?" 
"Well… that's not entirely wrong." 
Bersil doesn't know I'm a player. 
Plus, Bersil is originally from the modern world, so unlike pure-blooded mages, he's terrible at research, and his perspectives and way of thinking are different. 
That's why I chose Raven. 
One player is enough for this world, and I needed the perspective of a local. 
"Anyway, can we get back to the main point now?" 
"Okay." 
After that, Raven and I stayed at the starting point and talked about the boss fight we were about to face. 
Most of the time, I'd talk, and Raven would ask questions out of curiosity, understanding or being amazed by the answers. 
"I wouldn't have thought there was such a method. Is that knowledge also from your world?" 
To be precise, it's not from this world, but simply my own knowledge gained through my 20s. 
"…That's basically it." 
"It's a really careless answer." 
"What are you saying? I always speak from the heart." 
"That's good to hear. Anyway… Since we have time, tell me more about your world." 
This request came just as I was about to start heading out. 
It was hard to completely reject her, considering I owed Raven a lot. 
"It's not difficult to talk about, but… suddenly?" 
"It's not sudden, I've been curious the whole time. But I didn't have the chance to be alone with you until now..." 
Well, talking about this kind of stuff outside would be a bit worrisome. Even if she was curious, she wouldn't come to ask separately or anything. 
"………30 minutes only. People are waiting outside too." 
"Yes, okay. 30 minutes only." 
"So, what are you curious about?" 
As if she'd been waiting for those words, Raven immediately brought up a question. 
"Internal combustion engines." 
"………Huh?" 
A word I never imagined coming out of Raven's mouth. 
"I heard that because of such an engine, huge carriages made of iron move without needing words or magic, right? I'm curious about the detailed principle." 
"………." 
"Do you… not know? I clearly heard that there is such a thing..." 
Could it be because she's a mage? 
When I was telling Amelia stories about the modern world, it was all about romantic stories of huge flying machines that soar in the sky, and the people choosing their king directly. 
"I, I don't not know." 
"Oh, really? Then tell me. About the exact principle of internal combustion engines!" 
"Well… steam? Heat energy? That's what they use to make the wheels turn." 
"…………Is that all?" 
Raven's gaze was chilling, as if it had cooled down somehow after hearing my answer. I felt a pang of shame, but I boldly continued. 
"That's it. Details like that were top-secret information handled at the national level. It was hard for people like us to learn about it." 
If Hyeonbyeol were here, he'd scoff and despise those words. 
But what difference does it make? 
Hyeonbyeol isn't here. 
There's just a naive mage from this world. 
"In simpler terms, it's like the magic of this world, right? Then I understand. Even the basic exchange device of magic engineering is something most people don't know the principle of." 
Raven nodded seriously, and we continued talking about the modern world, answering her questions. 
From the moment she asked about internal combustion engines, I noticed something. Raven knew surprisingly much. 
"It's a field I've been quite interested in." 
"Is that so?" 
"Yes... I've been studying it separately since then." 
"You've been studying?" 
"After we met again, I became a little interested. Since I'm in the army, it's relatively easy to get related information... " 
It's true that she used to avoid modern stories, uncomfortable with the idea of evil spirits. But now, her curiosity seems to be even greater. 
That's why she brought it up right away, with just the two of us. 
"Anyway… time is running out." 
"Oh, already?" 
Raven seemed disappointed, but she didn't insist on talking more. 
***
The essence of a 5th-floor rift guardian is highly valuable. 
There are twelve types of rifts that can open, making it much harder to obtain a specific essence... 
In fact, guardian essences from the 5th-floor and above are never seen in auction houses. 
Nobody wants to sell them, and even if they did, the royal family would secretly claim them first. 
"Mr. Yandel, have you been to this place before?" 
"No, this is my first time. At least, in this body." 
"Oh..." 
"Didn't I say we were done talking? Focus." 
We left the starting point and soon reached the boss room. 
*Whoosh-* 
A small flame burning in the middle of a blackened forest. 
This flame surrounds the boss room of the 5th-floor rift, "The Burning Forest." 
Originally, you could only reach this place after clearing several chapters, extinguishing all the fires that erupted in the east, west, south, and north areas... 
But here, all those tedious steps are skipped. 
*It's basically copying experience points.* 
Plus, guardians here drop essences with 100% certainty. Well, to be honest, it's not that big of an advantage. 
*It's a good thing this 5th-floor rift allows two people to enter.* 
The rifts below can only be entered solo. 
In other words, you need to have the specs to solo a boss to get the essence. 
But usually, people with that level of specs don't need the essences of bosses they can solo. 
Like all the essences I haven't used and left behind. 
*Hm, theoretically, a mage could solo a boss, collect the essence, and sell it.* 
Of course, it's just theoretical, not realistic. 
There are mages who can fight a boss 1:1, but to achieve that level of skill, they'd need an enormous gap in specs due to their class characteristics. 
And they wouldn't even make any money. 
The cost of the vial they'd use is a bonus. 
"What are you thinking about? You suddenly stopped." 
"Ah. I was just thinking about something else. I'll summon the guy now, so you stay over there. Use that magic I asked for right now." 
"Okay." 
I finished my thoughts and approached the crimson flame floating in the air. 
*Whoosh-* 
As soon as my hand touched the flame, it rippled, emitting a wave. 
*Hua-ju Pianil used [Mark of Ashes].*
*The character will take fire damage when using skills.*
The 5th-floor rift guardian awakens, and a grey mark is imprinted on my hand. 
And then. 
*Whoooooosh-* 
The flame, swirling and growing, completes a form. 
Hua-ju Pianil, the guardian of the Burning Forest. 
A 4th-grade monster with the official name, Lava-lord. 
*This one doesn't talk either.* 
I watched him for a while without attacking first, just in case there were any differences. 
*Whoosh-*
His entire body is made of flame. 
He wears a mask that reveals his lower face, and his upper body is similar in structure to a human's. 
His lower body resembles a genie from a magic lamp, with flickering flames where his legs should be. 
*He looks the same...*
Just like I did after meeting Duke Cambormier, I tried to initiate a conversation, but it didn't work again. 
So, I started the strategy right away. 
He was considered a mid-level difficulty monster among 5th-floor rift guardians, but as long as things went according to plan, it wouldn't be too hard. 
After all, I'm not alone anymore. 
All I need to do is fulfill my role as a tank. 
Just like this. 
"Behel—laaaaaaaaahhhh!!!" 
Using [Gigantification] and [Savage Eruption] to inflate my threat level. 
*The character's threat level is over 500.*
*All monsters within range will prioritize attacking the character.*
I also activated the Aegis barrier, ensuring that I completely draw the attention of this rift guardian, who has a difficult threat management. 
And then... 
*Hua-ju Pianil used [Cinder Bell].*
Whether he uses a summoning spell or an attack spell, whether he transitions phases, or unleashes unique gimmicks. 
I just continue to endure. 
I could deal damage by getting a buff from Raven and using [Swing], but...
*Why bother?* 
My damage output is already sufficient. 
Just like how Bjorn Yandel, who had fought desperately in the Bloody Citadel, has grown so much, Raven has also made significant progress. 
*The rage of the forest is imbued in Hua-ju Pianil.*
We slowly deal damage, and soon reach the final phase. 
"I told you, the final part is tricky." 
"It's okay to take your time. It's warm, it's nice." 
After all, the Bellarios essence is a counter to magical damage. 
*The character's magic resistance is over 500.*
*All magical damage received is reduced by 50%.*
I reduce the damage by half, and then using the Fire Orb, I further decrease it. It feels like being in a sauna. 
Oh, and the temperature feels like 120 degrees. 
"………Mr. Yandel, you've truly become a monster." 
I actually haven't been able to breathe properly since earlier, but compliments from your comrades are enough to get any Barbarian dancing. 
I continue to hold the boss while Raven finishes her magic.
*Arua Raven used the 3rd-grade freezing magic, [Blooming Snowflower].* 
That young mage who could barely cast 6th-grade Sun Magic in the Bloody Citadel is no more. 
There is only the "Golden Mage" who has earned a position as vice-captain in the 3rd Magic Corps, her skills recognized by the royal family. 
*Higher-level magics have such poetic naming conventions.* 
It was my first time seeing this spell, so I focused on observing it. 
The magic effect was simple.
*Whoosh-* 
First, a chill spreads from Raven's feet, strong enough to freeze the surrounding ground.
And then...
*Whoosh-*
Something translucent shoots towards the monster like an arrow. 
Without any physical force, it sinks into the monster's body, and at that moment... 
"……."
The monster stops moving. 
The heat disappears, leaving a chilling silence in the forest. Raven opens her mouth. 
"Mr. Yandel, do you know why this magic is called 'Blooming Snowflower'?" 
A quiet, leisurely question. 
But Raven continues without giving me a chance to answer. 
"It's because it blooms." 
"……?" 
"From within." 
The magic activates at the perfect timing, as if she'd practiced it beforehand.
*Ziizzzzt-* 
As if the magic begins from within. 
Dozens of ice spikes pierce through his skin and jut out. 
"But." 
"……?" 
"The reason it's 'snowflowers', not thorns, is different." 
Raven finishes her words, and at the same time, the boss, who had entered the final phase, turns into a light orb in an instant. 
Raven smiles, watching the sight. 
"How's that? Doesn't it feel like snow falling?" 
What is she saying?
She clearly practiced the lines herself. 
I pondered for a moment, trying to figure out what I'd name the scene if I were the one who cast the spell. 
Considering the monster was covered in thorns after being hit by the magic...
*Trans-Sea Urchin.* 
Hm, the sound of that is a bit off. 
*Trans-Pufferfish.*
Yeah, I like this one. 
***
After putting Hua-ju Pianil's essence in a vial, I continued challenging 5th-floor guardians with Raven. 
We've developed a routine. 
After learning the strategy at the starting point, we always have a 30-minute chat. 
Oh, of course, this is Raven's request. 
"I'm helping Mr. Yandel, right? So stop acting annoyed." 
"Oh… helping? There's no need for that kind of… " 
"What's 'that' between us? I'm not even a member of Mr. Yandel's clan." 
I had no way to retort. 
So, I just chatted with her. 
Raven's initial curiosity was about modern technology, but lately, she's been asking me more about myself. 
"So… what was your name back there?" 
"Didn't I tell you?" 
"...You didn't." 
"Lee Hansoo. Lee Hansoo. It's absolutely not Hans, be careful with the pronunciation." 
"Lee… Hansoo…." 
"That's right, this pronunciation is decent." 
"Decent? What's decent?" 
From my real name to whether I have family and friends waiting for me there, what kind of job I had, and so on. 
Some of her questions were a bit heavy. 
After a simple background check, the conversation naturally shifted to [Dungeon and Stone]. 
It happened when we were talking about how I had opened the "Door of the Abyss" once. 
"...So, Mr. Yandel, you've actually opened the 'Door of the Abyss'?" 
"In the game, though. And as soon as I opened the 'Door of the Abyss', I was dragged here, so I don't know what's beyond it." 
"………Wait. If you came here after opening the Door of the Abyss, what happens if you open it from here?" 
"……?" 
"I, If you open the 'Door of the Abyss', does it take you back? Back to the real world?" 
"Well... maybe it would. " 
"Oh, oh? Um... I see..." 
"That's enough for now. Let's start moving." 
After that, we entered the boss room, and almost suffered a major crisis due to Raven's mistake. 
Thankfully, I was able to carry the team and get through it. 
*…We've already taken down 6 of them.* 
I was secretly worried about the 5th-floor guardians, but things are going smoothly. 
Of course, there were a few situations that were more dangerous than the previous one. 
But maybe it's because I've gone through so much already? 
This doesn't even feel like a crisis anymore. 
"Mr. Yandel, if you're okay with it, shouldn't we head to the next portal?" 
"...Huh?" 
"It's just that you still have HP left. And we've finished all the information transfer." 
Well, that's true, but...
*It's weird.*
I felt a bit suspicious about Raven's urging, so I lightly patted her shoulder. 
"Raven, I'm going to enter with someone else now." 
"...What?" 
"You've worked hard. Get some rest." 
In other words, the Bloody Citadel carry duo is done. 
But Raven's expression turned cold, not the welcoming one I expected. 
"Rest? What's that supposed to mean? Are you going to abandon me now?" 
"...Abandon? What are you talking about?" 
It's just that I don't need a mage anymore. 
Besides, where we're going now doesn't require collecting essences in vials. 
"You're talking nonsense. So... if it's not me, who are you going to enter with?" 
I simply smiled as a response to Raven's question, and headed towards someone else. 
"Emily." 
"……?" 
"Let's go get some essences." 
She's due for a new essence.
