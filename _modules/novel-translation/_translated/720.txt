## The Audience (3)
I first doubted my ears. Had I heard correctly? 
Stunned, I couldn't even manage a composed expression.  Then, I pondered, "How could the King of the Cataclysm speak Korean?"  
I desperately searched for an answer to this question, but my mind was a fog.  Even if dozens of ninjas had suddenly materialized from the ceiling and walls, I couldn't have been more surprised.  "Focus," I thought, forcing myself to concentrate on the current situation.
The first possibility that sprung to mind was that the King of the Cataclysm was an evil spirit of Korean descent.  This fleeting thought was quickly dispelled by his next words, however.  
"What's with the stunned look?"
On closer listening, his pronunciation was far too clumsy to be that of a native Korean speaker.  It was like a Caucasian man searching for a paper towel in a bathroom, if you will.
This observation helped me formulate a more plausible second hypothesis: the King of the Cataclysm was neither Korean nor an evil spirit.  He simply knew how to speak Korean, perhaps having learned it from someone who was "drawn" to this world from some other dimension. 
With this hypothesis established, I understood the "elevator" as well—or rather, I understood how it came to exist in this world. 
"Hmm, I thought you'd have anticipated something like this," the King murmured, abandoning his broken Korean for his native tongue.  "You seem naive.  But it's natural, considering you also tortured aliens when you encountered companies that achieved radical technological advancements, right?"
"..."
"We've merely done the same."
Perhaps he was right.  Maybe I had been naive.  Just because a world is barbaric doesn't mean its inhabitants are all stupid.  It's unlikely that they would simply execute, without question, someone who had come from another dimension, just because they were an "evil spirit," like burning a witch.  That would be illogical. 
"There was more to it… than meets the eye." 
The "Ghostbusters" community of evil spirits.  Not all members of this group are evil spirits.  As the first line of the letter I received made clear: "[This letter is sent randomly to explorers suspected to be players.]"
These are the "few" who managed to survive in this world and even excelled in some fields, ultimately earning an invitation to become part of this community.  As the saying goes, it's just the tip of the iceberg.  There must be many more modern humans drawn to this world than I know, and some of them must possess specialized knowledge.  Among them, there could be those who knew how to build mechanical devices using electricity or steam.  Of course, they wouldn't just create such things and release them into the world, given the risk of their true identities being exposed.
"But it's different," I mused.
The royal family, which had captured and imprisoned countless evil spirits for decades, using organizations like the Secret Security Force, must have acquired a vast amount of knowledge.  And they must have advanced that technology further. 
I saw the results with my own eyes.  
Click.
The King of the Cataclysm, seated on the throne, pressed a button on something he was holding.  A familiar melody filled the air.  Though the arrangement was subtly different from what I knew, it wasn't difficult to recognize the song.  A famous English band's song, one that wished for everything to go smoothly.
"...."
My body froze instantly upon recognizing the song being played through the "speaker" in the corner of the throne room.
Looking at me, the King of the Cataclysm quietly asked, "What's with that expression?" 
"You look like you just saw some kind of magic."
Damn it.
***
My head feels numb.  Even that expression is inadequate to describe my current state.  It's like watching a video of the person you love cheating.  My unwavering faith has been betrayed.
"It can't be.  How can science exist in a fantasy world?" I muttered to myself, especially in a world based on [Dungeon and Stone], the game I'd enjoyed for a decade.
"You seem to recognize the music," the King remarked.
"..."
"The American who sang and recorded this song.  He's the reason the song differs from the original, but...  what can we do? Everyone says he captured the original feel quite well, so we just have to accept it."
I remained silent for a moment, then asked, as the King had suggested, "What happened to that American?" 
There was no point in pretending to be a barbarian in front of this guy.  He already knows I'm an "evil spirit," even a "Korean."
"Your speech has become abrupt," the King said.
"It was you who said we should be straightforward, wasn't it?"
"Hahaha! You really do seem to be a barbarian, right down to your brain."
"Answer me..."
"Hmm... I don't know...  "
As the King hesitated, the knight guarding him answered instead.  
"Once the Dimensional Technology Department reported that there was no remaining valid information on the subject, we immediately disposed of him."
"Ah, that's right," the King murmured indifferently.
I realized with a newfound sense of shock.  In all media, including novels and comics, the modern humans summoned to this world are the main characters, while the natives are mere supporting roles, there to enhance the modern humans' image.  
But in reality, things were completely different.  
These guys are the true protagonists of this world.  Compared to them, we are simply a tiny part of a much larger world, just a single "event."  I learned this today, the hard way.
"...So, was that why they were exterminating evil spirits? To capture them and steal their technology?"
As I gritted my teeth and asked, a faint mocking laughter echoed from behind the silk, followed by an answer.
"Of course not. Evil spirits are inherently entities that should disappear from this world. We simply took advantage of that process."
"..."
"Oh, of course, that's not the only reason.  There's also the fact that the fox riding on the back of a tiger is furious about the existence of 'evil spirits.'"
...Fox riding on the back of a tiger?
I unconsciously furrowed my brow at the words, unsure of who he was referring to.
"Oh, you don't know about that story yet?"
"..."
"Then I can't tell you here.  Stories are best enjoyed when heard firsthand, after all."
So he doesn't want to talk about it.  
Based on the context, "the fox" likely refers to the "Prime Minister."  But that's not important right now.  
Instead of asking about "the fox," I raised a different topic.
"Are you referring to 'her' as 'the witch'?"
"Correct."
"What does it mean to be chosen?"
"Wrong."
"...."
"There's no reason to tell you, so it's incorrect, barbarian."
"You were the one who said we should be straightforward."
"This is as straightforward as it gets, isn't it? I'm the king of a country, after all."
"..."
The King of the Cataclysm was completely different from what I had imagined.  I never thought a king could be so frivolous.  Well, I guess it's better than him being stuffy and authoritarian?
"No, maybe he's just trying to lull us into a false sense of security, like Baekho." 
Whatever his demeanor, he is still a king.  Someone with the power to reduce everything I possess to nothing with a mere gesture.  But I know.  
A crisis can also be an opportunity.
"Maybe..."
Today, I might be able to take a giant step forward in uncovering the secrets of this world that I've been holding onto for so long.
"You were chosen by her, weren't you? If I kill you, she'd be furious, and I can't do that."
If his earlier statement was true, at least my safety is guaranteed.  Therefore, I decided to adopt a more proactive stance.
"Why have you been hiding under the pretense of being ill all this time?"
I would continue to bombard him with questions, using this opportunity.  It wouldn't hurt to ask, and if I could glean even a single piece of information, it would be a win.
"Huh?  I haven't been hiding.  I just sleep a lot, so I couldn't go out."
"Sleep...?"
"It's a thing."
The King responded as if it were a matter of inconvenience rather than a secret, and I didn't press him further.  Because there was something else I noticed.  
The moment he saw me, he said: "[My subject, Baron Bjorn Jandel.]"
He said "Viscount," not "Baron."
What if this wasn't simply a memory lapse or a slip of the tongue?  What if he was actually telling the truth, and he only knew information from before he went to sleep?  Is that too much of a leap?
"Perhaps... he's under some restrictions when he's awake."
Though it was still just speculation, the information was precious and valuable, considering who the subject was.
"Why did you summon me here?"
"That's a strange question to ask, isn't it?  Is it something a thief who snuck in through the back door would say?"
"But you were the one who summoned me to the throne room, weren't you?"
"Oh, I suppose you're right.  But I'm honestly curious.  How did you guys end up here?"
"Is there no other intention than that?"
"There was one thing I wanted to confirm, but it's already done."
"..."
"So, does that mean you have no more business with me?"
"Not quite."
"...Then tell me."
"That'll come a bit later.  When you eat a meal, the most delicious part is always saved for last, isn't it?"
Well, I can't agree with that, at least not when it comes to food.  I prefer to eat the delicious things first.  You never know if they'll be left for later.  Anyways, that's beside the point. 
"Are you behind this war?"
"No, I'm just a victim.  I won't say I had absolutely no knowledge, but I'm definitely not leading it.  Satisfied?"
"Then who is behind it?"
"That's related to the delicious part, so later."
The King of the Cataclysm, who had been quick to answer my barrage of questions, suddenly interrupted me and said firmly, "You're asking too many questions.  You're getting one more answer, so understand that.  Oh, and I won't answer questions that are too morally compromised."
Right, one last question.  If I ask about really important information, he's definitely not going to give me an answer.  
So, what's the best final question?  What question is the most logical out of those that don't cross the line?
"...."
After a short moment of reflection, I slowly began to speak.
"Why are you answering my questions one by one?"
The witch, the war...  Maybe these distant stories are less valuable than this question, one that might be worth more to me right now.
"Ah, that?"
The King of the Cataclysm answered from behind the silk.  In a remarkably natural voice.
"Isn't persuasion better than intimidation?"
I expected it, but this king is definitely a few screws loose.
"So I'm going to try persuasion first," the King said with a smile. 
"..."
"Before I say that if you don't follow my orders, I'll dispose of everyone you know."
Just because he's smiling doesn't mean it's not a threat.
