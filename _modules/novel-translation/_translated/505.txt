## Chapter 505: Basement Floor 1 (1)
Thud, thud, thud—
I was running through the cave with my new companions, deliberately lagging behind under the pretense of taking up the rearguard position. I trailed behind them, their backs my focus.
"Mister, could you explain? Why are we going to the second floor?" 
The distance between us was excessive, even for companions. Of course, if I exerted myself fully, I could close the gap in less than a second. Yes, I'm sure I could. But...
"To be precise, it's not the second floor, but the Goblin Forest."
Why was it that I felt an insurmountable distance, a gulf that would take a lifetime to bridge? 
'I thought… if time passed… things would return to normal… but...' 
Though I'd made a conscious effort not to be hasty, my confidence was waning with each passing day. The reason was simple. 
I had witnessed it firsthand.
"It's for your own good." 
"Yandell, don't be disagreeable and listen. You're in a very unstable state."
Upon hearing this, the first thought that crossed my mind upon seeing Bjorn's acceptance wasn't, 'I should have been the one to say that.' 
I lost.
It was because I hadn't even considered such a thought. I'd only pondered what Bjorn would choose, offering what I believed to be his desired response. 
Even that, I'd said without conviction, burdened by the weight of passing years. 
"Well... killing it... might be... better...? I think...," 
I hadn't even considered my own thoughts. I'd simply observed and blindly agreed, mirroring his concerns about what was best for him. 
Come to think of it, it had always been this way. I hadn't questioned or advised him on which path to take. I'd made a vow to follow him, regardless of the path he chose, and his appearance, but that was all. 
'Amelia Rainweales.'
I felt a chasm, a difference in our standing as humans. I had accepted it, accepting that this was what a companion truly meant.
My absence hadn't erased my place. The very spot I'd believed I had to return to, that place I had to reclaim, was nothing more than a mere cargo hold in a forgotten warehouse.
"...Are you alright? You've looked distressed since a while ago." 
I gritted my teeth, forcing a smile as I met Amelia's gaze, who had come all the way to the rearguard to inquire.
"Don't worry about it. I'm fine."
It didn't matter if I had a place or not. It didn't matter if he acknowledged me or not.
"It's because Bjorn Yandell will die otherwise."
There was something I absolutely had to do here. 
*** 
The third day began, and roughly an hour had passed.
Thud, thud, thud, thud!
The entire cave began to tremble, and the crystals began to emit a red glow. This meant the Dreadfear, the Dread Lord, had been summoned somewhere within the crystal cavern.
Of course, the fact itself wasn't particularly surprising. Eight requests for its extermination had already filled the Explorers' Guild.
The issue lay in the timing of the summons.
'Summoned in less than an hour? How many people are on standby?'
It wasn't something we should be saying, still moving as a group of seven, but it seemed that those eight teams with extermination permits weren't the only ones on standby.
Well, most people think alike.
Exterminate the Dread Lord Dreadfear.
Even I, when planning this expedition, considered the possibility that the key to the hidden area might be found there. 
Unfortunately, the extermination requests were already full, so I couldn't apply.
Exterminate the Verzac, the Abyss Lord.
If this were the key, it was entirely out of the question at this point.
'...Everyone must have some sense, they wouldn't summon Verzac, right?'
I believe they would, but I can't be entirely sure. Looking at the situation, it seems like dozens of teams are on standby throughout the entire cavern, not just the eight that applied.
If just one or two teams got greedy, it would be a catastrophe.
'Whatever, I'll just focus on my own thing.'
However, it's not like I could go around the entire cave and persuade everyone, so I simply hurried forward.
How long had we been walking?
"The character has entered the Goblin Forest on the second floor."
Soon, we ascended to the second floor, and then continued at top speed, reaching the third floor before the third day's end.
"The character has entered the Pilgrim's Path on the third floor." 
A vast floor composed of over ten different fields. We ascended the Goblin Forest, passed through the Greentail Swamp, where Lizardmen appeared, and moved to the Sculpture Temple, one of the adjacent fields.
A field filled with the ruins of collapsed stone buildings. Similar in appearance to the Pantelion Ruins on the seventh floor, Dark Continent, but there's one difference.
There are a lot of statues here.
Though they all have broken necks.
"It's an unpleasant place, no matter how many times I come here."
"But there aren't many people around, right?"
The Sculpture Temple is by far the least popular area on the third floor. It's simply because there's only one kind of monster that spawns there.
"The character has defeated an Unnamed Sculpture."
Unnamed Sculpture.
A seventh-grade monster similar in appearance to a Stone Golem, but much smaller, about the size of a person, and quite agile. And...
"The Unnamed Sculpture has cast [Answerless Prayer]."
This thing's skill is known to be trash. When players use it, it eats up MP like crazy, but it mostly fails.
Well, these guys seem to have a much higher success rate.
"A great power is bestowed upon the Unnamed Sculpture."
If the prayer succeeds, a random Essence below the fifth grade is temporarily bestowed.
Because of that, it's a difficult monster to hunt for a seventh-grade monster.
Or rather, it's tricky. You have to face unexpected skills in every battle, so it's not just about fatigue, but also high-risk due to many variables...
For this reason, it's safe to say that no explorers stay here to hunt.
That's understandable, as the Essence is trash.
If you're aiming for experience, it's enough to kill just one on the outskirts.
'Plus, the location sucks.'
If you want to go to the fourth floor, it's much easier and faster to go through the adjacent field. It's a field that's hard to find even for explorers passing through, the Sculpture Temple.
'Well, the material drop is pretty decent.'
The Sculpture Temple's only advantage is its 'materials.' If you cast Warp magic on them, they sometimes drop 'Magic Crystals,' which sell for a pretty good price.
Of course, that's even more efficient if you mine them on the fifth floor, so this place isn't visited often.
In any case, our reason for coming here was to acquire 'materials.'
Actually, there's something else that drops besides 'Magic Crystals.' 
"Come on, everyone, let's move!" 
Feeling the time slipping away, we hurriedly started hunting.
"Bersil Goulond has cast the sixth-grade spatial magic [Superior Warp]."
"Bersil Goulond has cast the sixth-grade spatial magic [Superior Warp]."
"Bersil Goulond has cast the sixth-grade spatial magic [Superior Warp]."
Since we have enough fighting power, we just had the magician cast Warp magic.
"The character has defeated an Unnamed Sculpture."
"The character has defeated an Unnamed Sculpture."
"The character has defeated an Unnamed Sculptu—..."
"..."
We break every statue we find.
However, there was still plenty of downtime, so we divided ourselves and began mob hunting. 
"Behel—laaaahhhh!!! "
Unlike humans, monsters go crazy when their threat level increases.
We used this to our advantage, sweeping the area and driving the statues to the center, then killing them as Bersil cast Warp magic on them.
And during the respawn period, we moved a good distance away and carried out another mob hunting session.
12 o'clock, 4 o'clock, and 8 o'clock, based on the center. We were rotating between these three positions, perfectly synchronized without a single break.
"The character has defeated an Unnamed Sculpture."
"The character has defeated an Unnamed Sculpture."
"The character has defeated an Unnamed Sculptu—..."
"..."
How long had we been going crazy hunting like this?
We'd already gotten six 'Magic Crystals' when the first item I wanted dropped.
"Bjornnn! This! Isn't this what you're looking for?"
A small piece of rubble with artificial patterns etched on it.
"The character has acquired an 'Unnamed Fragment'."
A sun pattern. 
***
Unnamed Fragment.
An item you have a chance to obtain when you cast Warp magic on an Unnamed Sculpture and defeat it.
It can't be stacked in your inventory, and each one drops with three random patterns. 
And it's impossible to take back to the city.
'I got the sun, so it's the moon and the stars left.'
I'd been trying everything under the sun because I figured there'd be some kind of secret to these fragments.
Finally, a use for them.
"So... Ms. Yandell was aiming for these fragments...?"
"Doesn't it seem likely? Stars, sun, moon."
"...I don't know much about it, but it seems like a pretty plausible attempt. Time is an issue, but it's not completely impossible."
Ascending to the third floor, acquiring the item, and going back down before the first floor closes.
It's difficult, but not impossible. We're in a pinch since we wasted over two days on the first floor, but things would have been easier if we'd gone straight to the third floor from the beginning.
"Maybe next time."
As Bersil said, it seemed unlikely that we'd be able to immediately enter the hidden area this time.
The reason was simple. It takes eight hours for an 'Unnamed Fragment' to drop from the 'Warped' corpses.
'I need two more, so 16 more hours.'
Simple calculations show that even assuming the remaining patterns drop without repeating, we're short on time. 
Also, it's tough to increase our hunting speed any further. Getting one in eight hours was possible because we could mob hunt the entire field.
'Most importantly, if Bersil's MP runs out, we can't use 'Warp' anymore.'
Well, I guess this run was impossible?
I'd thought we might just about pull it off if we hurried, but maybe I was being too optimistic—
"Hey! Bjorn! Another one!!"
Huh?
I blankly received the pebble Ainar handed me.
"The character has acquired an 'Unnamed Fragment'."
A star pattern.
In other words, it means we only need to get one moon fragment within the next eight hours. 
'What? I think Ainar got one earlier too.'
The 'Beginner's Luck' I got earlier doesn't give any item drop rate bonuses, does it?
Luck tends to roll when you're on a roll. 
"I'm changing the plan."
"..."
"Ainar will be solely responsible for killing monsters from now on. The rest of you, move around the area and lure monsters to her."
From then on, even if it meant wasting some time, we continued mob hunting with Ainar taking on all the fights.
About five hours passed. 
"The character has acquired an 'Unnamed Fragment'."
Another fragment dropped.
"It's a moon pattern..."
I had to admit it now.
"Ainar."
"Go ahead and compliment me!"
"Barbarians are indeed a superior race."
"Wooooooooo!!!"
Ignoring Ainar's loud shouting, I even used [Enlargement] and tossed him up and down in the air. 
"Heeheehe! Hehe, hehehe!"
As expected, Ainar relished the moment, happier than ever. 
Bang!
Okay, so the reward ceremony is over.
I quickly led the team back the way we came.
The fifth, sixth, and seventh days...
The unusual experience of backtracking to the lower floors. Thanks to Ainar, we had plenty of time to set up camp, relax, and take care of our stamina as we moved, finally arriving on the afternoon of the seventh day.
The center of the Goblin Forest on the second floor.
The open space near the portal connecting to the first floor, the Crystal Cavern. It was the very spot where we once fought a fierce battle against the three Noarks guarding the entrance.
"...What's going on here?"
It was packed with explorers, seemingly out of place. Even a rough estimate showed there were over a hundred people...
They couldn't possibly be explorers who gave up their search before the first floor closed.
If that were the case, they wouldn't be gathering in front of the portal...
Spark!
The explorers coming through the portal in real-time looked terrible.
"Priest! Is there a priest here? Help me!"
"Drink this first!"
What is going on?
As I approached the portal, the explorers recognized me and began to murmur.
"Giant...?"
"Wasn't he supposed to be on the first floor?"
The explorers seem to be questioning why I came from the other side, not the portal.
Ugh, I wanted to go down to the first floor secretly because I knew we'd be spotted like this...
Since it was already too late for stealthy movement, I picked the most talkative explorer dude and asked him.
"Hey, what's going on?" 
The answer came quickly.
"...Verzac! That devilish bastard has appeared!"
Ugh, I kinda guessed it, but... 
"..."
No wonder we've been having such good luck.
