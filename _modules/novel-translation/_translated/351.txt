## The Abyssal Continent (2)
The scorching sun beat down on the sand, already hot to the touch. A cool yet humid breeze carried the tang of salt; this was Rymeia, the Island of Beginnings. But the vast ocean stretching out across the horizon was nowhere to be seen.
"You've entered the Great Sea of the 6th Floor."
As soon as we crossed the portal, towering galleons, over a hundred of them, lined up along the coast came into view. Their hulls were so large, and their numbers so numerous, that the vast ocean felt cramped.
"Alright, move aside now! We've got more people coming through!"
Before I could even take in the surroundings, I was ushered away from the portal by an explorer bearing the insignia of the Explorer's Guild. His tone was so casual, I asked Erwen about it. Apparently, he wasn't a regular employee of the guild. Maybe he was an explorer who had been hired by the guild?
Erwen explained that the guild had been asked to assist the royal family in managing the explorers but, lacking the manpower, had outsourced the task.
"Well, they wouldn't send ordinary employees all the way to the 6th Floor, would they?"
Regardless, the well-established procedures for this war, now over a year old, moved smoothly.
"Over here! Please register for combat first, and we'll help you with your squad assignment."
After waiting in a long line along the eastern coast, I handed over my ID card and completed the registration process. I say "process," but there was a small commotion. Erwen was too famous.
"Erwen Pornachi di Tercia... uh, uh, Bloodline Lady...?"
"Is there a problem?"
"No, no…  nothing! I apologize for the disturbance!"
The registrar seemed uncomfortable even speaking to Erwen, who had arrived alone. He rushed through the registration.
"5th-grade Explorer, Emily Rains. You have a previous combat record. Registered."
Amelia was next, and her registration was even quicker – a mere second. Using a new identity, she had listed her age as 22. She had begun as a 9th-grade Explorer and meticulously worked her way up, even paying taxes, making her a perfect clean slate. As long as she didn't run into anyone who knew her face, like Erwen, her identity was a free pass. 
Unlike me, who was met with a rather pointed look.
"5th-grade Explorer, Lihen Shuitz. You have no combat records. Would you mind removing your helmet?"
Amelia had procured a new identity for me: Lihen Shuitz, belonging to an explorer who had been active five years ago. Thanks to a broker diligently paying his taxes all this time, there were no issues on paper.  But...
"Hmm."
The registrar's reaction was curious, considering my face seemed younger than my age of 29. It felt like I was a minor trying to buy cigarettes. Thankfully, I had dyed my hair a light brown according to the ID, and my eye color was the same.  
"Anything wrong?"
"No, good luck with your return. You've been gone for a while, haven't you?"
"Thanks."
Although I did remove my helmet for inspection, everything went smoothly. As Amelia had promised, they wouldn't question me much, considering the number of retirees returning to combat after the war.  In fact, there were two such cases among the Seven Pillars.
"Alright, now just the squad assignment."
After registration, we moved to the bulletin board nearby. It listed all the vessels on standby, along with a brief summary of the crew. The choice of vessel mattered during wartime. 
Upon arriving on the 7th Floor, explorers on the same vessel formed a single squad.
"Don't worry about which ship to choose. As a newbie, you can't board anything but the 3rd-class vessels."
"3rd-class?"
"Explorers without any notable achievements or affiliation with large clans typically board these vessels.  Their combat power is lower, so they usually stay in the rear for support roles."
Oh, so newbies have to work their way up from the bottom, huh?  Well, if there's a newbie holding everyone back in a dangerous battle, it would just create trouble.
"So, I guess we're taking that one."
We chose the 3rd-class vessel with the fewest crew members. Having fewer crew members means better chances of getting a three-person cabin.
"Thankfully, we were able to get a triple room."
"Why are triple rooms hard to find?"
"They're not that rare, but they're the most popular."
I didn't need to ask why.
"Ah, so the bonding magic was updated while I was gone."
In this era, six-person teams were the norm. A triple room is the most popular choice as it conveniently separates them into just two groups.
"So, we set sail tomorrow. From now on, we can relax."
"Okay! What should we talk about?"
"……I said relax."
"Yes, I know. I just said we should relax."
"……"
I looked at Amelia pleadingly, but she was already in bed, having neatly organized her belongings.  The nerve of her, pretending to be asleep.
"So, maybe we can talk about the war...?"
"Okay!  Are you curious about anything?"
"Usually, the crew on the 3rd-class vessels handle support duties in the rear. What kind of stuff do they do?"
"Uh, I've always been in the front, so I don't know much... but I think they handle securing the retreat or escort duties."
I wasn't really tired, so I continued to chat with Erwen and learn about the war. Time slipped away.
Knock, knock.
Suddenly, we had a visitor. It was someone we all knew.
"...I heard we were on the same ship, so I came to say hello. Long time no see, Tercia."
I couldn't believe we were reunited so soon.
***
The blonde woman stood in front of the closed cabin door, straightening the collar of her uniform. She sighed.
"Why did she suddenly do something so reckless?"
The Bloodline Lady, Erwen Pornachi di Tercia. That was why Raven was standing here. Somehow, the Bloodline Lady, a member of the Seven Pillars, had ended up on the 3rd-class ship instead of the 1st-class. 
"...Seriously, why do they always make me do the annoying stuff?"
Originally, the 3rd Mage Corps, where Raven belonged, was also supposed to board a 3rd-class vessel. After all, a mage unit needs an escort. But it definitely wasn't *this* vessel.  It was just that she had been reassigned due to orders from above. 
"I barely even know this woman anymore. We weren't that close back then, either."
Although their past affiliation with the same clan was the reason her superiors assigned her to this vessel, Raven herself felt nothing but anxiety. How could she control that crazy woman?  What kind of trouble could she stir up next? 
"Even if they did order it, I need to at least talk to her. I have to find out what her intentions are..."
She sighed and knocked on the door. 
Knock, knock.
The door opened about ten seconds after she knocked.
Creak.
The rusty hinges groaned under the sea breeze, and the interior of the cabin was revealed. There were three people inside, just as she'd been told.
"5th-grade Explorer, Lihen Shuitz. And Emily Rains."
One of them was wearing a helmet even inside the cabin, while the other had their eyes and ears covered with a black cloth extending to their nose. This only fueled Raven's curiosity. Who were these two, and why were they traveling with a woman like the Bloodline Lady?
"Quit staring and get to the point, old man."
The cold, almost aggressive voice made her stop observing the cabin and focus on Erwen. Raven tried to force a businesslike smile.
"...I heard we were on the same ship, so I came to say hello.  Long time no see, Tercia."
"Yeah, so now that the greetings are done, can you get out?"
Tsk, this woman's bad manners – when would she ever learn?  Even though Raven was annoyed, she kept her composure. She was far too curious to leave just yet. For example...
"By the way, you called him 'old man,' right?"
Why did Erwen call this man "old man"? Didn't she use that term exclusively for *that* man? 
"……"
Unfortunately, Erwen remained silent. She just stared back at Raven with an expression that seemed to ask, "What business is it of yours?"  However, her eyes seemed a bit anxious, almost as if she'd been caught doing something she shouldn't have.
"Hmm."
Raven shifted her gaze from Erwen to the man. He was completely unfamiliar, and his helmet hid his face, yet there was something strangely familiar about him.  To be precise, she couldn't quite put her finger on it. No, it's not that they shared any common features...  yet he still vaguely reminded her of someone. 
"Could it be...? This man... "
Raven's jaw dropped. She stared back and forth between Erwen and the man. 
***
The silence stretched on. The longer Raven stared at me, the more my thoughts raced.
"What the heck? Did she figure it out already?"
What happens now? Will I be able to convince her that I'm not a demon?  If she doesn't believe me, the royal family will surely hear about it... 
"……"
I just moved my eyes to Erwen. She was looking at me, too, with an expression that seemed to say, "What do we do now, old man?" 
I felt a little ridiculous.  I mean, she's the one who made the slip-up, so why is she looking at me like *I'm* the one who messed up?
"Could it be..."
Just then, Raven's lips parted, breaking the uncomfortable silence.
"To think you'd stoop so low."
...Huh?
What does she mean by that? 
Erwen and I both looked at each other, bewildered.  Then Raven continued in a sad tone.
"Tercia, or rather, Erwen...  It's not right to find a replacement."
"Ah...?"
"There could never be another one. You just have to move on, even though it's difficult."
"Uh... huh...?"
Finally, I understood what was going on. She had completely misunderstood. She thought Erwen missed me so much that she found a man who looked like me and was playing pretend with him, even covering his face.
"And you."
Raven turned her head swiftly, her petite uniform perfectly accentuating her figure, and glared at me. 
"I know what you're thinking."
"……"
"So, forget about using Erwen. Even if you feel that way, I won't allow it. I'm going to keep an eye on you.  If you try anything even remotely inappropriate..."
Raven trailed off, and I blurted out a defense, unable to contain myself.
"Wait! I don't know what you're talking about, but I never—"
"The voice..."
"Voice?"
I tilted my head, confused.  Raven stiffened for a moment, then avoided my gaze. 
"The voice...  it's so similar... yes."
Her reaction was like she'd finally understood why Erwen was acting that way.
"So that's why..."
Raven muttered with a sigh. Then, she turned to Erwen and said,
"But you can't do this. This sort of thing...  I'm sure he wouldn't want it, either."
She spoke with genuine concern, her tone almost begging Erwen to reconsider. 
However, there was no chance Erwen would listen. After all, she was completely wrong.  
"You, who are you to interfere? You don't even know anything!"
Erwen finally snapped out of her trance, throwing up her defenses, or rather, launching an attack.
"Get out! And don't come back!"
Erwen slammed the door shut, forcibly pushing Raven out. 
***
After Raven's visit, time flew by.  The day of departure arrived, and the warships docked along the coast all unfurled their sails. The nature of this vessel was also determined.
"The Mage Corps' escort... "
The explorers on this vessel would be assigned to escort the 3rd Mage Corps as soon as they reached the 7th Floor.  They would then join the battle.  
Combat formations and tactics were taught during the voyage, with the crew gathered on the deck. 
"That's why they assign each vessel to a squad. They have time to train on the way."
The estimated journey to the 7th Floor was about fifteen days.  Except for training time, most of the time was free, but I spent most of it on the deck. It was a simple reason.
I realized, once again, that barbarians were terrible with seasickness. 
"Uweeek-!"
Even though the ship was so large, the rocking of the waves made my stomach churn.  I just couldn't stay inside.  It was fine, though, because I could just vomit wherever I wanted. 
Anyway, I spent so much time on deck that I ran into Raven several times, quite frequently, in fact. She always seemed to appear when Erwen was gone.
"...You even throw up like him. It's disgusting."
"……Weeeek."
"Why do you cover your face like that? Is it because Tercia told you to?"
"Wuk..."
"Well, your face doesn't look like him at all."
"……"
"Why do you hide your face like that? Don't you have any pride?"
"……"
"Just you wait!  I won't let you get away with this."
Ugh, I feel like I'm going to die. Why does she keep bothering me?
