## The Return of the Lion (2)
The sky was a shade of melancholy blue, yet sunlight still pierced through. A gentle warmth, capable of pushing back the chill that had seeped into my bones, surrounded me. Here, there was no bone-chilling cold, no gnawing hunger.
“Now… I can finally grasp it. I've… truly come back alive…,” I whispered, the weight of my words settling upon me.
As always, the city we returned to after facing such hardship held a strange, unsettling aura. While survival was a cause for joy, a heavy burden settled upon my heart. Those who couldn't make it back with us lingered in my mind, their absence a constant reminder of the sacrifices we made.
“If only… if only we had held on a little longer…,” I murmured, the words catching in my throat. Perhaps a few more could have joined us, but the thought was too painful to dwell on.
“Marone.”
Sven Parav, standing beside me, gently nudged me out of my melancholic reverie. Marone bit her lip, her quiet muttering silenced.  Returning to the city wasn't the end; there were still trials ahead. Perhaps even tougher than those in the labyrinth.
But…
I forced down the resentment bubbling inside, not just because we were back in the mansion where we had trained before entering the labyrinth, where words had to be chosen carefully. 
No, I couldn't allow myself to complain. No matter how high and treacherous the mountains ahead, those who fought till the very end for our arrival were still trapped in the labyrinth.
“Kailsan, are you alright?”
“Oh, I couldn’t be better! Though I seem to be the last one here, I see?”
Kailsan, who had been summoned by the priest who had been stationed at the mansion, returned, bringing the remaining members of our expedition together in the reception hall.
“How about a walk?  The weather looks beautiful today.”
“I’d love to.”
“Love to?”
“Have you seen the knights stationed outside the reception hall? We can't even step outside without them stopping us.”
Akuraba’s explanation sparked Marone’s discontent, her voice tinged with frustration.
“Ha! As if we've done something wrong! We've just returned after successfully completing the mission! This kind of treatment is unacceptable!  If they're going to treat us like heroes, then they should!”
“Marone…,” Sven Parav said, his voice barely a whisper.
He caught my eye, but there was nothing for me to do but watch. This much grumbling was expected. It was almost as if I had encouraged it.
The important thing was something else entirely.
“Ha-ha,  our expedition is still under the jurisdiction of the military.  Until we report our findings to the higher ups, our journey isn't considered complete.”
“Still, I'm from the military myself, and this is ridiculous! They're being overly strict!”
“Alright, alright. Calm down, everyone. Haven't we accomplished the task of destroying the Sky Eye to turn the tide of war?  Once the report is done, we can finally enjoy our long-awaited reward!”
“Whew, finally!”
James Calla, whistling, agreed with Kailsan. The conversation naturally drifted towards rewards, what they were hoping for, and how much they would demand.
It was a performance for those on the outside. They needed to know that we were craving wealth and power. The conversation would reach the ears of those in higher positions.
"Old man, at least they found a way to provide us with food quickly. Have some of this."
“Oh, thank you."
Chewing on the piece of meat from the plate Erwin brought me, I mentally reviewed the events that transpired. If there was anything I missed, I needed to find a solution.
“The guards at the checkpoint seemed unaware…,” I thought. As soon as we arrived at the Dimensional Plaza, we had stowed our backpacks in our sub-spaces. We had to carefully separate and store the equipment that needed to be shown to the Royal Family from those we had to keep hidden. 
At the checkpoint, I had loudly declared our status as a special force of the Royal Family and requested to speak to the Duke. It was intentional.
“With so many explorers at the checkpoint, news of our special force must have spread throughout the city by now.”
The checkpoint official, after initially fumbling, kept repeating that the Duke had instructed him to “keep us safe” and detained us. And then…
“From now on, we will guide you.”
The Duke’s knights arrived less than 30 minutes later. We were escorted to the vacant mansion in the Imperial City where the expedition was originally formed.
“We will take care of your luggage.”
“Luggage…?”
“This is the Duke’s order.  We, the knights, vow to ensure that nothing is lost. We give our word on our honor.”
Even the bags containing the spoils we could afford to show were taken, and upon reaching the mansion, we were treated individually by the priests summoned by the knights.
And here we are now.
Knock, knock.
The sound of a knock echoed through the room, followed by the door opening. It was about time. I had reached a conclusion about the current situation.
"The Duke requests your presence.”
Now’s the time to focus.
***
We followed the knights to a reception hall similar to the one we were just in, except… the main seat was empty. Instead, a crystal orb sat there.
“A Message Stone…,” I chuckled, the absurdity of it striking me. 
The Duke’s mansion was not that far from here. Using long-distance communication was utterly ridiculous.  Then again, it seemed he knew. He knew he had committed a grave sin against us.
“I apologize for greeting you in this manner. I have urgent matters to attend to.”
"Well, I understand," I replied, my tone calm and measured.
“Hmm, your casualness suggests… your team is already aware, isn't it?”
The Duke’s voice, laced with a hint of amusement, reached my ears as soon as I settled on the couch.
There was no point in concealing it, so I simply acknowledged it.
“We found out by chance. I’ve already informed everyone that I’m Bjorn Jandel. Of course, I only mentioned that we were forced to work with the Royal Family, so it’s no big deal.”
"That's a relief."
“But there’s something you need to explain first.”
I cut to the chase, my voice tinged with frustration.
"Tell me, why didn't the rescue team come?"
We had been endlessly discussing the best course of action, preparing for this very moment. 
“You wouldn’t have missed my voice broadcast throughout the region.  What happened?”
“The exact situation is still under investigation.”
“Still under investigation after all this time? And you send me a message using a Message Stone?  Seriously?”
“From what we've gathered, the enemy forces in Deadwood were far more numerous than expected. The rescue team tried, but ultimately had no choice but to abandon the effort.”
The answer was exactly what we had anticipated. It was just...  I hadn’t foreseen this.
“It seems that your region-wide broadcast alerted the Noark as well.  They must have become aware of the rescue team's existence.”
Oh, so now it's my fault?
How thick-skinned is this Duke?
"Then what about the initial lack of communication? If you had contacted us properly from the start, this wouldn't have happened!”
“Well, it seems there was some… error on my son's part.”
“Error?”
I repeated the word, my tone laced with disbelief.  
And then...
“I apologize for my son’s actions. My apologies—”
My anger exploded.
“Behel—laaaagghhhh!”
Not at the Duke, not at the Royal Family.
But at the man who was nothing more than a pawn in their game.
“Eltora Tercelion!”
"Hold on, calm down."
“So it’s all his fault? He’s incompetent? He failed to receive our messages?”
"Well, that's—"
“Duke! Where is that bastard? Wait, never mind. I might accidentally crush his head if I find him."
“….”
I slammed my fist on the table, as if consumed by fury. Then, I slowly inhaled, my breathing heavy. 
"Are you alright?"
The Duke’s voice echoed through the orb, his tone laced with uncertainty.
Well, I guess this kind of outburst isn't exactly my style. I might be a bit more volatile than the average person, but I always try to act rationally, considering the risks and benefits.
So...
"Compensation."
I asserted my demand, my voice now calm and measured. My anger hadn't completely subsided, but I had managed to control it. It was as if I was using my fury as a tool to achieve this goal.
"Compensation will be prepared. You took charge of the expedition as I requested, and you succeeded in the mission."
"Ah, of course. Compensation... yes, it is definitely necessary."
The Duke's promise hung in the air as I met the eyes of my team. 
Some of them nodded in approval. It’s all about the details, you know.
“Well, let’s leave the issue of compensation for later. I’d like to hear about your experiences…,” the Duke said, a hint of curiosity in his voice.
Here we are. The moment I’ve been waiting for. 
I took a deep breath and began to recount our journey. The Duke interrupted with questions occasionally, extending the process, but I finished within an hour.
"My son's foolishness has caused you great hardship."
Hardship, he said. It was over in just one sentence. It felt like a slap in the face, but I managed to hold back.
"I will do everything I can to ensure that you receive full compensation for my son’s negligence," the Duke assured me.
"And… I congratulate you all on your survival."
Oh, come on. Don't even bother with empty words.
“I’ll be in touch."
That was it.  The communication with the Duke was over.
“We will show you to your rooms.”
Did our stories resonate with him? I wonder… I guess time will tell.
***
We were escorted to our respective rooms. Large beds with fluffy blankets, warm sunlight streaming through the windows. It was a far cry from sleeping on ice in the labyrinth, and yet my weary body, burdened with 75 days of exhaustion, struggled to fall asleep. I imagine the others were having similar issues. 
What if the knights attacked us while we were asleep? The anxiety kept me awake.
“…,” I sighed, yet the weariness overcame me, and I drifted off to sleep.
And then…
“My neck’s still attached,” I thought, waking up the next morning, feeling perfectly fine.
Hmph, will I always have this anxiety every night, even in the city?
There’s a long way to go.
"Well, what can I do? I still have to continue.”
Two days after our return, we received back the backpacks we were forced to leave at the checkpoint.  
“Well, I suppose things got misconstrued. I only wanted to have your loot appraised, since you must have been exhausted, and offered to purchase them at a higher price than usual.  I'll ensure that this kind of misunderstanding doesn't happen again," the Duke said, his voice tinged with apology.
It was ridiculous, but he was true to his word. He bought anything we were willing to sell at a price far exceeding the market value.  We took this opportunity to dispose of everything we didn’t need.
Wow, looks like we have plenty of funds for our future adventures. 
"Oh, and one more thing. Because of your appearance at the checkpoint, the public is very interested in your expedition."
There was some good news, too. The news of the Sky Eye’s destruction had been broadcasted to all of Dark Continent during the war.
And the Royal Family’s special force appearing in the city.
These two events combined to spread rumors like wildfire.
“There will be a victory parade in two days.”
"Victory parade?"
"It will be held in the Royal Palace, and we will publicly acknowledge your existence, which has been kept secret until now, to the nobles and citizens of the kingdom. We will also be honoring your achievements."
Well, I had expected it, but two days is too soon.  Are they that efficient?
I was puzzled, but I understood soon enough.
“Oh, I see. They must have already prepared everything."
The parade was probably already planned, even before our return. The lack of survivors wouldn't be a reason to cancel it.
They would use the destruction of the Sky Eye to their advantage, mourning the fallen expedition while claiming all the credit.
“Be prepared. I will send you the details of the event, including the ceremonies and dress code. And, of course, we will take care of the outfits.”
“Got it. I’ll let the team know.”
“As I said before, there's a lot of public interest.  Even though it's inconvenient, please stay here until the parade.  If you need anything, just let us know.”
"Oh, actually, there’s one thing I would like to request…"
I made my request to the Duke, and time flew by.
And then…
“Waaaahhhh!”
“The heroes are here!”
The day of the parade arrived.
