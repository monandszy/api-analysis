## Chapter 366: Responsibility (4)
Raven broke the awkward silence. "Are you going to keep making that face? It's not like this is Yandel... or, Suitz's fault."
While she didn't know the full extent of my situation, her words were true. It wasn't entirely my fault, but the thought of being the one to push her over the edge lingered. If I hadn't gone looking for her, she might not have made that choice. Or perhaps, it could have happened anyway...
Dwarki.
Yandel Jarku, Bjorn's biological father.
Considering those two cases, it was impossible to rule out the possibility that my existence had altered the future.
"Ugh… I should have kept my mouth shut about this." Raven spoke once again, her voice filled with concern.
I couldn't just stand here and pretend to be ignorant anymore. That would be another deception. But…
"..."
Another thought crossed my mind. Should I reopen a wound that had finally healed? Just because I didn't want to shy away from my responsibility?
I was struggling to speak when Amelia and Erwen interrupted our conversation.
"The atmosphere is strange. Did we interrupt something?"
"Strange? Of course not. But... Mr. Suitz, the two of you… what were you doing…?"
Amelia and Erwen walked in, having pushed aside the tent flap near the entrance.
"..."
I turned my head back to see Raven focusing on her documents again. This wasn't the right time for this conversation.
"..."
In the end, I didn't say anything that day.
***
"The dungeon has been closed."
"Your character will be transported to Laphdonia."
***
Day 75 of the exploration.
The 7th floor's closing day had arrived, and we returned to the city.
"Wow, it feels like forever since we last came here."
After spending over two months in the dungeon, the city felt unfamiliar. I could see why some of the upper-class clans took a month or two off after each expedition.
"Are you going straight home?"
"For now. I need some rest. Then we'll treat ourselves to some good food."
"Yes!"
Leaving the exchange office, we headed straight for our manor. Our pockets weren't exactly overflowing with gemstones. We had received receipts with the royal seal for all the loot since reaching the 6th floor. We could exchange them for money at the Merit Bureau, but it would be a few days before the crowds thinned out. 
"Ah, finally home."
Our manor, with its small garden and boarded-up windows, felt like a sanctuary after our long expedition. 
We agreed to eat the takeout after we showered, so we moved to discuss who would shower first.
"Suitz, you take the bathroom on the second floor."
"Huh? Thanks, but can I shower first?"
"The bathroom on the first floor is bigger. We can share it."
I didn't quite understand.
“…What? You two are sharing a bathroom?”
The image of the two of them in the bathroom together was hard to imagine.
"When did you two get so close?"
I asked, unable to hide my surprise. Erwen waved her hands frantically.
"Cl, close? No! Absolutely not! You say something too. Why would I shower with you?!"
"It's more efficient. Well, if you really hate it, I'll shower first."
"What? Why do you—"
"Then I'm going in."
"...Wait, stop!"
Amelia headed for the bathroom, followed by Erwen, who was yelling something.
"They never seem to quiet down."
I shook my head and headed for the second-floor bathroom. I was curious to know who would shower first, or if they would actually share, but...
It didn't really matter.
I doubt they'd be pulling out weapons and fighting over a bathroom at this point.
"Ah, I feel like a new man."
The hot water washed away the weariness from my body. I felt the weight of the expedition finally lifting.
"Still, it's been a pretty smooth ride, considering all the things we've been through."
After the initial attack, there hadn't been any major incidents. We continued to patrol and level up until reaching level 7, maintaining a peaceful existence. The main force, however, seemed to have encountered some trouble, as they requested some of our troops for support.
Nothing to do with me, of course.
Raven had to stay in the rear because of her strategic role, and that applied to us as well. We were part of her squad.
"I'll sell the equipment first, then exchange all the receipts for money... that's the plan for the settlement."
I went over my gains from the expedition while showering, feeling a wave of nostalgia.
"Level 7…."
A level that was now worthy of bragging rights. And considering the number of 3rd-grade essence we had collected, it could even be considered the starting point of the late game. 
It felt like yesterday that I was struggling to survive goblin traps.
"I've grown so much."
I felt my own growth, and with good reason. What made this expedition so smooth?
The Corpse Collector, the Shrieking Witch, the Lighthouse Keeper, and the Blood Knight.
We had fought no less than four members of Orcullis. In the past, someone would have had to sacrifice themselves, and I would have had to risk my life. But despite all that…
"I need to get stronger."
Rather than satisfaction, I felt a greater sense of inadequacy. Because we still had a long way to go.
I wasn't yet confident enough to guarantee the safety of myself and my comrades against formidable foes like the royal family, Auril Gaviss, or Baekho.
"I need to reach level 9 somehow. I also need to resolve the spirit imprint issue as soon as possible..."
My thoughts trailed off.
"Mr. Suitz, are you taking your sweet time? I'm thinking of reheating the food..."
"Ah, I'll be right out."
I realized I had spent a lot longer in the bathroom than I thought. I hurried up and emerged to be greeted by the warmth of the reheated food and lively conversation.
"Suitz, what are you going to do about the Guild matter?"
"The Guild matter?"
"Raven, that woman said that if you wanted to avoid the royal family, you should try to deal with the information recorded at the Guild."
"Ah..."
Rihon Suitz, 5th-grade explorer. My last dungeon entry was about five years ago. But if the royal family were to access the records kept by the Guild, my disguise would be instantly exposed. Everything would be there: Rihon Suitz's team, the essence he consumed, and so on.
"It's obvious that even a few simple questions to old teammates would raise suspicion. Not to mention bringing them face-to-face with you."
We needed to burn Rihon Suitz's records, or modify them so they couldn't be traced. And that was something only an insider could do.
"Do you know anyone who might be able to help?"
"Well, I've never been close to the Guild."
Despite those words, a figure came to mind. Julian Urbans. The cherished daughter of the Guildmaster, whom I had once held hostage to clear my name.
"She's a rather unique woman, even if I think about it now."
She wished for her father's downfall because she didn't want to live a life like a puppet. I wonder what she's doing now. If I had helped her and gained her favor back then, would she be willing to help me now?
***
The day after we returned to the city.
Amelia went out to sell the Lighthouse Keeper's equipment, and Erwen said she had to visit the sanctuary. And...
"Well, I should head out too."
I got dressed and went outside. We had agreed that this was okay. Raven hadn't even recognized me, and I wouldn't be easily associated with Bjorn Yandel just by my face. Besides, staying home all the time would be suspicious.
"I should have met that dragonkin girl with this face."
The dragonkin priestess, who had called me ugly on first sight, wouldn't lie about my appearance even with this face. Tsk, what's so good about this weakling's face anyway?
"Alright, I'll head to that place first..."
This was the first proper outing since I returned to the present. As I strolled along, taking in the surrounding streets as I did when I visited the past, I soon reached my destination.
[Karssia Lomne.]
A blacksmith shop with a pretentious name in ancient language, not befitting its line of work. Magic Flame, perhaps?
This was the shop the dwarf, Hikurod Murad, built after leaving Team Half-Penny.
"Apparently, his business is booming."
I'd heard some about it from Raven, but I didn't expect it to be this impressive. The fact that the shop had expanded to include the neighboring buildings meant the business had been successful in those two and a half years.
"I should check it out."
Curiosity got the better of me, and I stepped inside the blacksmith shop. I was examining the displayed equipment when I heard a familiar voice.
"Ha-ha-ha! The displayed items are not for sale. They are just examples for custom orders. If you're looking for something else, just tell me!"
Turning around, I saw a familiar face.
"Hikurod Murad."
"Oh, you know my name? Ha-ha-ha! Seems like I've become quite famous lately..."
The dwarf laughed heartily, looking up before noticing me and flinching.
“…Huh?”
"What's wrong?"
"Ah, nothing. It just… felt strange. You're a tall, handsome young man, aren't you?"
I wondered if he recognized me, but it seemed like he didn't.
Okay, I guess I can walk around with my face uncovered now. There's no one who'll recognize me.
"But… why do I feel so disappointed?"
I pushed that strange feeling aside and continued the conversation.
"Is the owner around?"
"Ha-ha, I don't do blacksmith work anymore."
"Why?"
"Why would I, when I have blacksmiths doing it for me? They're much better than I am, too."
“…I see."
"This suits me better, really. It's like I finally found my true calling. Tell me, if you want anything, I'll find a way to make it affordable for you."
He seemed to have abandoned his dream of being a blacksmith and switched to sales. No wonder his business was doing so well.
"He's even wearing a mithril necklace."
To be honest, I was quite shocked. He had abandoned his dream, and his attire was completely different from what I remembered.
But the final blow came with his last words.
"Eh, Tsk… I went out of my way to explain everything to you because you looked rich, and look what I get in return. I have the worst luck."
I told him I wasn't buying anything and just came to look around. As soon as I said that, he lost his smile and shooed me away.
"Get out! You're in the way of other customers!"
I was dumbfounded, pushed out the door. What happened to him? Why did he become so greedy?
"Still, it seems like he's doing well."
I left the blacksmith shop and headed for the training facility whose location I had memorized. That was where Mr. Rottmiller ran his business, teaching scouting skills to explorers...
"It's closed. I wanted to at least see his face."
It seemed like the shop wasn't open for business today.
"Where should I go now?"
I considered going back home, but I had nothing to do there, so I chose a new destination.
[Laphdonia Central Library]
There's no place better when you have nothing to do.
I walked through the open door, a sign that the library was open, and saw the familiar desk. But…
"What?"
The faces at the desk were different. There should have been only one librarian with sleepy eyes at that large desk.
"Welcome. We are pleased to have you here."
Over twenty staff members were sitting at the desk, working. It was just like the library from 20 years ago.
"Where's the original librarian?"
“…Who are you referring to?"
"Ragna Litaniele Peprock..."
“……?”
One of the librarians tilted their head, confused by my question. They went to ask the other librarians and came back with an answer.
"They told me that it's the name of someone who retired before the library renovation."
“…Do you know when they retired?"
"They said it was right before the renovation, so about two years ago."
Two years ago…
Well, that's true. She didn't have the right qualifications to stay as a librarian forever. She was handling the work of dozens of people by herself with her vast magical power.
"Is there anything else I can help you with?"
"No need, I'll handle the rest after casting a detection spell."
"The spell fee is 3,000 stones!"
Well, they're charging a fee now?
It was clear that many things had changed in my absence, but I paid the fee and searched for a few books before settling down in a seat.
How much time had passed?
Dr-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r!
Who the hell is snoring so loudly?
Dr-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r!
I couldn't take it anymore and looked up, the snoring sounding almost rhythmic.
"Sir… sorry to bother you, but could you please wake up…?"
A librarian was practically begging the giant barbarian, who was also snoring loudly, to wake up.
Dr-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r!
Ugh, he's embarrassing all barbarians.
"Huh?"
The barbarian, waking up, wiped their mouth and stood up. I couldn't help but flinch.
"Ah, sorry! Must have dozed off for a bit!"
The blonde hair was roughly braided and hung loose. The gold eyes held a defiant spirit.
"Ah, yes… Then I'll have to ask you to leave..."
I couldn't believe I'd meet her here.
Her frame was so much bigger that I almost didn't recognize her, but her face was unmistakable.
"Ha-ha! Do I have to kick you out? I apologize! Don't be so harsh. Ah, is ‘harsh’ a difficult word?"
Ainar, the second daughter of the Pnellen family.
