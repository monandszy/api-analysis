## The Portal of the Second Floor (2)
I had expected the portal to appear eventually. It was obvious, really.  Encountering the blonde party of high-level adventurers was proof enough that a portal to the second floor lay somewhere within the direction I'd been traveling. And finding the trail of blood, I’d followed it with unwavering conviction.
But this was something I hadn't anticipated. I hadn’t imagined a portal could be located just ten meters from the starting point.
“Damn it.”
Memories from my time crawling on all fours flooded back, a relentless panorama.  Was I truly this unlucky? If I'd taken just a few steps in the opposite direction, I could have activated the portal, secured a source of light.  If I’d done that, I might have seen the damn trap and avoided this entire mess!
“Sir, please tell me. Don’t just make that scary face. If I’ve done something wrong, I’ll fix it…”
What was she rambling about?  Wait, it’s because of me.  Too much hassle, I’ll just brush it off.
“Don’t worry about it. Just reminiscing.”
“Ah…”
Erwen looked at me, relieved, then her gaze softened, tinged with pity. I couldn't believe it.  From the bloodstains, the bread crumbs, the sandals, and my expression alone, she deduced what I went through on my first day? This little elf?
“He must be in a good place now.”
Of course, he wasn't. I knew it.
“Yeah… thanks.”
She seemed to think I was reminiscing about a fallen comrade, but I saw no need to correct her.  Explaining it all would be a long story.  Besides, the sheer injustice of it all would make me want to scream.  Better to just bury the memory.
“Are you ready to go up?”
“Honestly, I'm still scared, but I feel like I won’t die if I’m with you.”
She really had a habit of talking a lot.  A simple 'yes' would suffice.
“Let’s go then.”
“Yessir…”
As soon as I stepped into the portal with Erwen, the world turned blindingly white.  Like a burst of light from a monitor. 
Flash!
[00:57]
Just over four days since entering the Labyrinth.
“You have entered the Goblin Forest on the second floor.”
I had arrived.
***
If anyone asks me how I feel right now, I’ll tell them it’s like being stuffed into the mouth of a giant frog, chewed for a while, and then spat out.
“Aaaah!”
I felt weightless, like I'd been flung into the air.  I didn't scream as pathetically as Erwen, but looking at the results, she was definitely better off.
Thump!
I landed on my backside with a thud, while Erwen quickly regained her balance and landed gracefully.
“Wow, that was scary.  Even my sisters haven’t said that.”
I had to admit, she really was physically capable.  A level of agility a Barbarian could never achieve.
“Sir, are we on the second floor now?”
“Yes.”
“Hmmm, I haven’t heard about a forest. Are you sure?”
“The story you heard must be about a different second floor.”
“A different second floor?”
Did elves even share Labyrinth information?  How could she not know this?
“There are four portals on the first floor for each direction, East, West, South, and North. Each one leads to a different area.”
“Oh, right! Now I remember!”
…She just forgot, huh. 
I gave her a look of disappointment, and Erwen stammered.
“Oh, the third floor!  No matter which path you take, everything connects again from the third floor. Right?”
She wanted to show off her knowledge.  I nodded vaguely, and Erwen smiled, satisfied.  I was getting a feel for how to handle her.
“So, what should we do now?”
“Wait. I’m thinking.”
First, I carefully assessed the surrounding area.  I needed to figure out how the real world differed from the game and vice versa. For example, I’d just flown about three meters when we came through the portal.  Things like that, things you couldn’t see through the monitor.
“Hmm.”
I surveyed the area again.  Behind me was the portal leading back to the first floor. The clearing, about fifty meters in radius, was devoid of any living beings.  Well, I couldn't tell what was behind those trees in the distance, though.
“Is there anything I can help with?”
“Stay put.”
The second floor map was a forest.  The surroundings were pitch black like night, but the scattered lights in the sky created a kind of visibility.  It felt about as bright as a back alley with no streetlights.  But it wouldn’t get brighter with time.  This was a Labyrinth.  That wasn’t actually the sky, just a ceiling high above.  Although there were floors with real skies and suns, of course.
“Let’s move.”
“Huh? Where are we going?”
“We’re going to explore the area around here.”
I had a rough plan from the first floor, but there were a few things I needed to verify.  So, I’d start with what was right in front of me.
Wham!
I swung my hammer at a tree on the edge of the clearing, and Erwen jumped.
“What are you doing?”
“I was checking if it’s possible to cut down trees.”
“Why would you do that?”
“I was thinking of building a fence around the portal.”
“Hmmm, I see.”
Finally, Erwen nodded in understanding.  I was already getting tired of answering her questions one by one.
“Never mind. This plan is scrapped.”
Erwen didn’t ask why.  Well, she had eyes, didn’t she?  Even with all my might, I only managed to chip off a bit of bark.  What kind of tree was this?  It was basically a rock.
“What’s the next plan?”
“We’ll search the area as planned. And from now on, you lead.”
“...Me?”
I decided to avoid questions. 
“Your tasks are: find traps while you walk ahead. And be mindful of your presence, keeping an eye out for enemies. That’s all.”
“...So, it’s a role division? Okay.”
Surprisingly, Erwen readily accepted her assigned role.  Why did I feel a pang of disappointment?  Maybe it was because I’d already prepared my persuasive speech.
“Still, it’s nice to be in a forest, even knowing there’s only monsters here.”
Erwen wandered along the forest path, making a comment I couldn't relate to. 
“Oh, I don’t think there are any traps, but just in case, please stay on the path I’m walking on.”
What?  Her?  Suddenly, I felt strangely secure.  She wasn't even afraid of traps, walking briskly.
Soon, she muttered under her breath.
“There’s a trap.”
I couldn’t see it.
“If you look over there, you can see it hidden under the leaves.”
I couldn’t see it, no matter what she said.  Then, Erwen, with a look of ‘How can you not see this?’ picked up a stone and threw it.
Clank!
It was real!  How could she see something like that in the dark, from this distance?  Even though I already knew about her detection skills, seeing it with my own eyes was incredible.  So, that’s why she was walking so confidently.
“What do you think?”
“You throw stones well.”
“...Is that all?”
“What else is needed?”
This was my chance.  Erwen’s shoulders, which had been relaxed and open, slumped.  The perfect opportunity to give her some sugar.  Subtle enough to avoid being too obvious.
“Finding traps was a skill I expected from you from the beginning. You’re already a fully fledged adventurer. Don't get too excited about doing your duty.”
“Hmmm…”
She tried to hide it, but I could clearly see her shoulders twitching.  I had her figured out.  I could handle her like this from now on.
“So, you’re saying I'm fulfilling my role as a proper adventurer?”
“Yes.”
Even though the distribution was 9:1.  Anyway, it seemed that my ‘One-Man Army’ technique, which our Chief liked so much, worked better than I expected.
“But it’s strange.  No matter how much I listen, I don’t think there are any Goblins around.”
Of course, there weren’t.  The second floor was different from the first. Traps didn’t always mean there were Goblins nearby.  On the second floor, traps were more of a terrain feature.  They were everywhere. 
“Let’s stop chatting and focus.”
“Yes.”
I steeled my nerves and continued to scout the area.  We were in what was called the ‘Goblin Forest’ in the game.  Besides traps, the other characteristic was that Goblins typically roamed in groups of ten or more.  There were also occasional variants like Goblin Warriors or Goblin Archers. 
Of course, as you got further out, the variants increased in numbers, and you’d even encounter higher-level monsters.  But since we planned to stick close to the portal, we didn’t need to worry much about that.
“There’s nothing nearby.”
We had completed our search of the portal area, covering a radius of about 200 meters.  There were countless traps, but no Goblin hordes.
“What should we do?”
“First, we’ll clear all the traps in this area, then gradually expand our range.”
We cleared the traps one by one, using stones thrown from a distance.  Just in case, we needed to be able to escape back to the first floor.  It would be a disaster if we tripped on a trap while running.
We had expanded our radius to over 500 meters when…
“Sir.”
Erwen stopped and whispered.  I held my breath too. 
“It’s a Goblin horde.”
“How many?”
“I don’t know.  Definitely more than ten, though…”
“Distance?”
“About 50 meters.  They don’t seem to have noticed us yet.  What should we do?”
Was she asking the obvious?
“We fight.”
Erwen didn’t argue.  She knew.  She knew we had no choice.  If she didn’t want to fight, she shouldn’t have entered the Labyrinth in the first place.
“How much closer can we get without being spotted?”
“If it’s just me, maybe 30 meters.  More than that is too risky. Goblins are sensitive to smell.”
“I see.”
I thought for a moment, then decided to go with my original plan.
Erwen slowly followed, pushing through the bushes in the direction of the Goblin horde. 
Was that the elf way?  It was incredible to watch her walk through the bushes without even a rustle.
“…”
Soon, Erwen stopped. She looked back at me, and when I nodded, she turned and strung an arrow.
Whizzzzz!
Did she hit?
I didn’t know.  Too far to hear the impact.  I hope she pierced his forehead properly this time.
Tat-tat-tat!
With the arrow’s release as my cue, I ran straight toward Erwen.
“Gruk!!!”
“Grrrruuuuk!!!”
The Goblins, clearly excited, charged forward, but Erwen calmly prepared her second shot.
Whizzzzz!
I never got used to that insane rate of fire.  You couldn’t really get a feel for that speed in a game.
Thump!
One of the Goblins charging forward fell.  She didn’t hit his forehead this time.  It was his neck.  Well, even elves wouldn’t be able to hit a moving target from that distance.
“Erwen, retreat.”
“Yes!”
Erwen didn’t hesitate to disappear from my sight, retreating to the back. 
All I could see before me was a horde of Goblins charging forward. Three times the size of what I’d encountered on the first floor.  Even for Goblins, this many would be enough to make anyone nervous, but…
Surprisingly, I wasn’t afraid.  
Instead…
Thump!
The warrior’s heart within this body was beating wildly, a primal thrill burning through me.
“Gruk, Gruk!!”
“Grrrruuuuk!!!”
As I heard the threatening howls from dozens of Goblins, I yelled back.
“SPARTA—!!!”
Bring it on, you bastards.
