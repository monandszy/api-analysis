## Chapter 604: The Legion Commander (1)
"You don't use aura like that."
The Chieftain's sword, swung with such arrogant words, proved his statement to be without exaggeration. It wasn't the power of essence. It was merely a blade wielded with honed technique. He cut, his target—the Archbishop—in his sights, and with greater precision than anyone else.
"Tsk, I couldn't kill him."
When the radiance of the pure white aura faded, the Archbishop, surprisingly, was still alive. His body was bisected along the path of the sword, but tentacles wriggled from the cut, reaching towards each other as if to reconnect.
"What will you do?"
The scene was undeniably unpleasant, yet the Chieftain simply asked me, his voice devoid of emotion.  Was that all?  My duty done?
"If you keep delaying, you won't be able to leave through the portal."
A decision had to be made swiftly. If the Chieftain had completely failed, I wouldn't have hesitated to use the portal.  But calling his current state a failure seemed ambiguous.
Thud, thud.
I strode past the Chieftain towards the Archbishop, forcibly separating his already half-fused body. Then, I tore a scroll containing a high-level fire magic spell and ignited it.
"No hesitation at all."
"...."
"You did clash with the Archbishop once, didn't you?"
The Chieftain seemed to harbor a misunderstanding. My lack of effort to save him wasn't born from hatred. I simply deemed it pointless.
*‘Even if I tried, it would likely be in vain.’*
The conclusion remained the same, regardless of how many times I pondered it. The Archbishop was a talent that could be prevented from becoming a priest of Karui.  Once a priest of Karui, there was no turning back to a regular cleric.  Yet, such a significant event, forced into place the moment he entered this rift?
*‘That can't be right.’*
The [Dungeon & Stone] I knew was not like that. When I was ignorant, the game seemed utterly unreasonable, but the longer I played, the more I realized my ignorance had been the source of my frustration.
WHOOSH-!
As the Archbishop's flesh began to blaze, I reflected on the events that led to this point.
*‘I made a mistake.’*
While it could be attributed to my ignorance, it was undeniably a mistake.  Even though I questioned why the Chieftain and the Archbishop remained unaffected by the mental contamination, I didn't delve deeper into the matter.  Truth be told, I wasn't entirely in my right mind even then.
*‘…The flower, too.’*
This field contained a flower that reduced mental contamination levels.  But when did it start?  At first, the Archbishop readily consumed the flower, but now he claimed he was resistant and even offered to share it with us.  Now I see, that was a sign.
*‘What would have happened if we'd given the flower to the Archbishop, cared for him, and proceeded with that strategy?’*
It's a meaningless fantasy now.  Unless I enter this rift again, I'll never know.
*‘Well, at least I gained some knowledge.’*
If this were the game version of me, I would add this information to the knowledge about the first floor rift:
Clerics can be promoted to priests of Karui.
They start with most skills unlocked, but in exchange, you must sacrifice a party member.
How to use it will need to be considered later—.
"So, are we done confirming things?"
"...Not yet."
I briefly glanced at the shrinking portal before turning my gaze back to the Archbishop. The tentacles, which had been wriggling fervently amidst the crimson flames, were now still.
"Are you thinking that something might happen if the Archbishop dies?"
"Yes."
The Chieftain chuckled at my honest response.
"I'm not sure if I should say this, but you're not entirely sane either."
"Should I take that as a compliment?"
"Well, interpreting that is your own responsibility..."
The Chieftain, who was casually responding, suddenly stopped talking. I didn't need to ask why.
"You have slain the priest who succumbed to temptation."
The burning Archbishop finally stopped moving. Then...
"Special Condition - The Third Record is met."
The Archbishop's body burst into a light, scattering outwards...
"No.???? Crown of Agony is created."
A strange object fell to the ground.
"It really turned out as you said."
It was a crown worn on the head. The flowers were black and white in color, not split evenly, but arranged in an alternating pattern.
"Do you know what this is?"
"I have no idea."
Initially, I thought it was a numbered item, but I can assure you, there was no such crown among the numbered items. So, what is it?
*‘…I’ll investigate later.’*
I secured the crown before checking the portal. Thankfully, there was still time left.  The red portal remained unchanged, while the blue one was now less than a third of its original size.
"If I may offer advice, choose the blue portal.  From this point on, consider me nonexistent."
"Nonexistent?"
"Time is short, so I'll be brief. The aura mana manipulation technique I used earlier is vastly different from how this body's original owner used it. This discrepancy has left my body in a state of complete ruin."
...So, the power wasn't unconditional.  Part of me feels a bit relieved, but also a bit terrified.  After all, it means I can wield that kind of power at any time, as long as I put in the time to adjust.
*‘Anyway, that's not the issue at hand now….’*
To put the Chieftain's words simply: I can go through the red portal, but then I have to overcome all the trials alone.
*‘Is that even possible?’*
I coldly assessed the situation.
The cleric, once overflowing with divine power, had fallen and had to be killed. The mage is now incapacitated and was sent out first. The knight, once the strongest, lost his power.
WHOOSH-!
We managed to open the portal, but it was a stroke of luck.  It was far from the orthodox solution.
Now, I had to admit. 
It was no surprise, since it was my first attempt at conquering a rift.
"I'm leaving this place."
I failed to conquer the first floor rift.
***
A mere blink of an eye was enough. 
When I opened my eyes, I was back. Not in the middle of the Great Demon Realm, a wasteland with a damp, oppressive air, but back in the place filled with guardian statues.
"Yandel!"
"Bjorn!"
"...Captain!"
The moment I emerged from the portal, everyone called out to me, each with their own greeting.
"I appreciate you all thinking of me, but let's talk later."
I understood their joy, but I needed to check something first.
"Uncle! How can you throw me like that!"
First, Erwen was fine. Her shrunken height had returned to normal.
"What about Gahyeon?"
"The clerics are treating her."
Thankfully, Gahyeon seemed to be alright.  I didn't know how badly she was injured, but it was only a physical injury, right?  There wouldn't be a situation where numerous clerics couldn't heal her—.
"Lord Baron!"
Someone then asked me.
"Where's the Commander? Where is the Commander?"
Jillian Evoust.  The sister of Baron Evoust and the second-in-command of our exploration team, a knight.
"Why isn't he still out—."
I cut off the second-in-command and explained why the Chieftain hadn't emerged yet.
"Count Saintred is dead."
By his own choice. 
He said there couldn't be a more natural exit for him, right?
*‘It's for the best, really. I was thinking about heading back to the city, but I need a believable reason to do so.’*
I'd been dumbfounded when I first heard that, but upon reflection, it was a major issue for the Chieftain. He couldn't suddenly commit suicide. Being killed by a monster was also difficult, since it would be hard for everyone to accept, and even if they did, it would leave a stain of dishonor on his reputation.
The Chieftain had no desire to abandon the life he had built as *‘Jerome Saintred’*.
In other words.
"He was a priest of Karui, armed with powerful abilities that could easily dispose of a Tier Monarch.  We bought time to escape, but he was eventually killed."
For the Chieftain, dying honorably while facing a powerful enemy, someone everyone could accept, was the best option.
"A priest of Karui?  Could this be related to why Archbishop Hesthaia hasn't come out?"
"I'll tell you more about that later.  But I have a question…."
I addressed everyone gathered, not just the second-in-command.
"How much time has passed?"
"It's been exactly 30 days, today."
"A month…."
No wonder it felt like we'd already set up a new home here instead of just passing a day or two.
*‘Still, this isn't bad.’*
A month is a long time. 
Considering that unlike the upper floors, time keeps flowing on the first floor, it felt even longer. 
But at least it wasn't the worst-case scenario.
*‘Everyone except Erwen and me stayed there for over half a year.’*
On the bright side, we'd saved five months.
Of course, for me, it was a complete loss.  I'd only stayed inside the rift for about a week.
"Then tell me, what happened inside—."
Uncle, why are you in such a rush?
"Let's confirm something first."
I pointed to a specific spot.  It had been on my mind since I woke up, though its importance was overshadowed by other things.
"Has that stone door been closed the entire time?"
"Yes. The portal disappeared and the stone door closed with it the moment the five of you went inside a month ago."
I'd woken up in the middle of this stone chamber. The portal, which had opened like a side door, had vanished immediately after spitting me out.
*‘…It's clear that I cleared the guardian judging from the fact that I came out, but why isn't the exit opening?’*
I'd firmly believed that clearing the rift would open a path to escape this stone chamber.  This was a real shock.
*‘What?  Because I didn't choose the red portal?  Then, does that mean I have to start over from the guardian statues?’*
As if to represent my complex thoughts, countless hypotheses arose, muddling my mind.  But then...
RRRRRR—
As if mocking my impatience, the firmly closed stone door began to slowly open. 
***
Beyond the open stone door lay a sealed chamber.  Three statues, about the size of large figurines, were placed on the floor, and a portal shimmered in the center.
*‘That portal seems like it's the exit….’*
In fact, the mage who had followed me in, and the rest of the team, were peering in with expressions of hope and longing.  It's only natural, since they've been here for over a month. 
"Raven! I'll grant you authority, so lead the mages to investigate this place.  Check the nature of that portal, what those statues are, and if anything else is hidden."
"...Me?"
"Oh, and second-in-command!  Gather all the leaders. I'll tell you about what happened inside."
It was a blatant overstepping of my authority, but no one protested. Only a few, those who were politically astute, expressed a slight concern.  Of course, Raven was one of them.
*‘Are you sure it’s okay?’*
*‘Don’t worry, you do your job.’*
After exchanging that silent dialogue with a glance, I left the stone chamber. While the second-in-command prepared for the leadership meeting, I caught up with my comrades. 
Oh, and I didn't mention anything about the rift.
"Why are you hiding it...?"
"I'm not hiding it, I just don't want to repeat myself.  I'm going to tell you all about it, so you can all come with me to the meeting and listen together."
"Can… can you do that?"
Amelia pointed out that I was merely the temporary leader of the fourth squad. 
But...
"You'll understand when you see it.  So, how was it over there? Anything happen?"
While listening to their stories, I used the remaining time to catch up.  Soon, the preparations were complete, and we moved to the meeting hall. 
A large, military tent that could hold up to 30 people.
"Ah, is that the Baron?  But those…."
The second-in-command, seated in his usual spot, trailed off as he saw my comrades.
"I brought them along so they could hear too. Is there a problem?"
"...No. There's no problem. This meeting is about listening to what happened inside.  But I hope you'll understand that we don't have space for them."
Is that because nobility is nobility, even without a title?  He's basically saying they'll be kicked out once the actual meeting starts.
"That's fine.  What's the big deal about standing and listening?  Are you guys okay with that?"
"..."
"They're okay."
As I stepped inside the tent, the empty seats caught my eye.  There were two.
Thud.
One was the commander's seat, the seat of honor. And the other, my designated spot, was opposite the second-in-command. 
Thud-
It was obvious. 
My seat for today was already decided.
"...."
"...."
Thud.
The moment I sat down, the officers' gazes shifted.  The second-in-command was no different.
"What... what does this mean, Baron?  Explain yourself."
He asked, trying to maintain his composure.
"What do you mean?"
I grinned, answering his question. 
"Don't you already know, second-in-command?"
"..."
"What this means."
"...."
It's time to activate (True) Barbarian Legion Commander Mode.
