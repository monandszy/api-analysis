## Chapter 582: Opening the Door (3)
Where to next?
That question had been thrown back at me, an attempt to gauge my preference, but the chieftain simply repeated, parrot-like, that I should decide. 
“I have no idea what he's thinking,” I muttered, letting out a sigh.
I finally settled on a destination, and the chieftain declared that he would announce it at the upcoming leadership meeting.  He seemed determined to play the role of a figurehead, his disinterest in the expedition apparently genuine.
“So, how did the research go?” I asked before parting ways with him.
It was the research that had been going on for over ten days, sparked by the suggestion that mages might be able to forcibly activate the dimensional monument.
"Hmm, I thought I told you it was a failure?” 
"But they were on it for so long, I thought there might be some results."
“Results, you say…,” the chieftain trailed off, then uttered something meaningful. “It wasn’t entirely fruitless.”
“Not entirely…?”
“The research confirmed that we can escape this place through the [Pagan Altar],” he explained.
He offered no details on how they arrived at this conclusion.  But he was likely telling the truth.  After all, why else would he have given the mages over ten days of research time?
I cut straight to the point. 
“When are you planning to return to the city?”
In my opinion, the chieftain’s true reason for staying in the labyrinth was “uncertainty.”
The first underground floor was unique.  For example, when our expedition first descended here, they tried to open the dimensional gate, but it wouldn’t budge.  That led to considerable debate. 
Should we consider this a normal labyrinth field?  
Mages and explorers engaged in countless arguments, and the consensus ultimately leaned toward “yes.”
The deciding factor was the Monument of Honor.
[The Barbarian warrior Bjorn Jandel and his comrades discovered the first underground floor.]
Despite its peculiarities, that single inscription confirmed that this place was indeed part of the labyrinth.
Why the dimensional gate wouldn’t open was a mystery.  Of course, it wasn’t as if there were no special areas within the labyrinth that prevented dimensional gate activation.
“You’ve gained your certainty, so why not just go back?” I pressed, but the chieftain shook his head resolutely.
“We’re not ready yet. I’m not confident that we can return without arousing suspicion.”
Well, I supposed that was true. 
If I were in the chieftain’s shoes, I’d have lingered in this body, gathering information about Jerome Saintred. 
“You seem to want me to leave as soon as possible, don't you?”
“Well, is it any surprise?”
“Why? We’re in this together, aren't we?”
Why, you ask? Are you really so clueless?
“In this together? You haven’t told me a thing about how to activate the dimensional monument.”
"I suppose… it's only natural that you don't trust me."
As I grumbled, the chieftain nodded in agreement and patted my arm in a gesture of paternal reassurance.
“Don’t worry so much. I’ll leave this place without a doubt. And when I do, I’ll tell you everything.”
This was getting absurd.
Did this chieftain even realize that his cryptic pronouncements only heightened my anxiety?
“…Maybe I should just take him out myself?”
The urge to strike him down was fleeting.  Instead, I decided to wait and see how things unfolded.
Just as I was about to leave…
“Oh, by the way, did you end up using that item I gave you this morning? The Twisted Trust, I mean.”
“…Oh, I completely forgot to return it.”
"No need to return it. It seems more useful to you than it is to me."
Damn it, just go ahead and curse me already.
His sardonic remark momentarily angered me, but I still tucked the Twisted Trust into my pocket before leaving.
***
When I arrived back at the mansion I was using as my residence, Erwin, Amelia, and Misha were nowhere to be found.
Instead, Vercil Goulend was waiting for me.
“You’re back?”
“You mentioned you had something to tell me.”
I knew what it would be, but I played dumb and took a seat.  I even cast a sound-muffling spell before we began to talk.
It was exactly as I expected.
“There are rumors that the evil spirits’ gathering was shut down.”
Vercil always delivered the most important information first, prefaced by the word “rumor.”  I was slightly taken aback.
"Rumors? "
"Yes. Well… we have our own evil spirits among us, right?”
So, where did this rumor originate?
Normally, I’d have pressed for the source of such information, but this time, I simply nodded.  I guess I’d never been one to question the origin of intelligence.  Because of that, Vercil seemed to have developed a complacent attitude toward me.
“This won’t do when we’re dealing with others…,” I thought, a tinge of concern rising as a leader.
Anyway, after discussing the “rumor,” Misha became the next topic of conversation.
“But what about that earlier today…?”
“Misha, you mean?”
“Yes. The information about how Kalstain could be a traitor, is that still valid? You two are getting too close.”
Vercil cautiously expressed their concern.  Their careful tone made my response even more decisive.
“You don’t have to worry about that.  I confirmed evidence that could be considered treason just the other day.”
“…What? Really? But why didn’t you tell me…?”
"It was nothing serious. After hearing her side of the story, it became clear that she had no intention of harming us.”
“I understand that you want to believe her, but how can you trust her?”
Ah, I knew this was coming.
“I used the Twisted Trust. After hearing her out completely, I confirmed that she had nothing to hide.”
Vercil was speechless, rendered mute by the revelation of the Twisted Trust. If they insisted on not trusting her now, it would be sheer stubbornness.
They were clearly curious about the supposed act of betrayal that I’d considered “nothing serious,” but I had no intention of explaining that.
“Anyway, there’s no problem with Misha now.  There’s no need for surveillance or anything, so treat her like a normal companion from now on.”
“…Yes. I will.”
Okay, that’s that.  The subject is closed.
I then asked Vercil to gather all the members of the provisional Fourth Squad, and once they’d assembled, I informed them that we were leaving the island today and that they should prepare themselves. 
“Oh…! Are we starting the expedition again?”
“So, the monument research was a failure then…,” someone else sighed.
“Ugh… my family’s going to be worried about me,” another muttered.
Some were disappointed that they couldn’t return home immediately, but the overall mood wasn’t bad.
“I was starting to get bored, so this is good news,” one chimed in.
"There are still so many places we haven't been to,” another added.
They were all explorers, after all.
***
The four ships sliced through the silver waves.
Our Clan Anabada’s boat, a small and precious vessel compared to the warships, trailed behind.
I sat at the bow, gazing at the warships ahead.
“How much more money do I need to make before I can afford a ship like that…?”
I could probably sell the Aegis Barrier and the Verdant Grandstand, but that would only make me a nouveau riche.  It wouldn’t be enough to amass the wealth necessary to purchase a ship like that, not unless I had enough cash to spare even after buying it—
“Jandel! What are you doing up there?!”
From behind, a sharp voice cut through my contemplation. 
Raven, the Third Magical Division’s vice commander.
“It’s dangerous! Get down here!”
Her voice sounded angry, and as I quickly climbed up to the deck, Raven looked up at me, her gaze like that of a child looking at a grown-up.
Damn, that was just a little too cute.
“What’s with that look?  What is it…? ”
“…Nothing.”
I stretched and surveyed the deck, spotting familiar faces alongside Raven. 
Meland Kaislan, Sven Parav, and a few others from the knights I’d taken notice of during the Library Island raid.
They were all part of the provisional Fourth Squad now.  The chieftain had readily agreed to my request before we left.
"Speaking of which, Raven, I have a question."
“…What is it?”
“Anything interesting happen during the monument research in the village?  You were part of the research, weren’t you?”
Since we had time to spare while sailing, I decided to ask about the research I’d been curious about. Raven answered enthusiastically, even using technical terms.
But in the end…
"I have absolutely no idea what she’s talking about,” I thought.
Dimensional distortion, spatial coordinates, and other terms meant nothing to a modern-day man disguised as a barbarian.
Noticing my glazed over expression, Raven blushed and changed the topic.
“Ahem! I think I got a little carried away with the technical jargon….  Jandel, can I ask you a question?”
“Anything.”
"Where are we going?  I think you must know.”
"Ah, you weren’t at the last leadership meeting, were you?”
“Mages were excused. We were all busy finishing up the research data."
"We're headed here."
I unfolded the map I’d looted from Hamsik’s house and pointed to our destination.
An uncharted island about a week’s sail from Library Island.  Unlike Rainbow Island, it was relatively close, so we had decided to explore it first.
As for the island itself, when I asked the chieftain if he knew anything about it, his response was this:
[It’s a truly mysterious island, and rather unique too.]
[Unique?]
[You’ll see once you’ve been there. I’ll tell you the rest when you arrive.]
I wasn’t quite sure what was so unique about it, but the way he said it made it sound like a very mysterious island.
“Hmm… I wonder what it’s like.  Hopefully, there’s some clue to uncover the secrets of this floor….”
Perhaps because it was an uncharted island, Raven didn’t ask about its nature, and our conversation ended there.
The days passed idly as we sailed.
Then…
"Captain! The flagship has stopped!”
“We’ve received confirmation that we’ve reached our destination."
After a week of sailing, we reached our destination.  I finally understood why the chieftain had called it a unique island.
“…That’s an island?”
No trees, no soil.  Or rather, there was no land itself for any of that to exist on.
The giant, monument-like structure stood tall amidst the churning silver waves.
***
After anchoring our ship a short distance from the island, I boarded the flagship where the chieftain was and requested a private meeting.
“Now we’re here, tell me, what is that… that stone floating on the sea?”
As soon as I stepped inside, I activated the Twisted Trust and posed my question. The chieftain looked at me with amusement.
“Why? You’re the one who said it’d be useful to you.”
"That wasn't what I meant...," I insisted.
“Fine, get to the point.  Time is of the essence.”
I was determined to get a straight answer this time, and the chieftain sensed it.
He finally answered my question without hesitation.
“It’s not a stone, it’s a door.”
“A door…?”
"If you touch it, it opens, and you can enter an unknown space.”
"What's inside?"
The chieftain paused for a moment before replying.
"I don't know."
It wasn’t the answer I had hoped for.
“…You don’t know?”
"That’s right.  In my former body, I couldn’t even open that door.”
"But how did you know it was a door?"
"I experimented, using someone who’d happened to come across this place, someone who’d survived, unlike yourselves.  But as a heads-up, I couldn't enter that door, so I have absolutely no idea what’s inside."
“…I see.”
"The man who went inside never came back alive."
His words sent a chill down my spine.  But I pushed those ominous feelings aside and focused on what I needed to know.
“What do you mean, survivor?”
"I told you before, sometimes people drift here.  A few of them even survive.”
“I don’t understand.  Why didn’t you take over their bodies?”
The chieftain retrieved a black stone from his pocket.
“Back then, I hadn’t gathered enough offerings for this stone to satisfy its desires. In fact, I’ve only managed to gather enough recently. You know, we’ve had quite a few arrivals this time, haven’t we?”
He was referring to the Silver Lion Clan members who had disappeared from the village and been discovered dead in the basement.
His gaze, devoid of any human empathy, made me uneasy.  But I kept my feelings in check, continuing to listen.
“The explorer who went inside alone was as strong as you. But he still never came back. That’s all I can tell you. I’m not even sure how many people can enter.”
“…I see.”
“So, you’re going to explore inside despite all this?”
He seemed to be testing me, his tone bordering on challenging.  But my answer was already decided.
“Of course. I’m going to investigate everything inside.”
I was determined to uncover all the secrets of this floor.
***
Before the Twisted Trust deactivated, I bombarded him with questions.
But he remained silent, and eventually, I had to settle for the knowledge I had.
I then informed the chieftain of our team’s line-up, specifying who would go in first, how many people, and in what order. 
"I'll arrange the personnel according to your plan.  But… are you sure about this?"
"Are you asking if I'm sure?"
"This means you’ll be the first to go inside.  You don't know what you'll face there."
"That’s why I’m the one going in first."
“Hmm?”
The chieftain simply smiled, a curious expression on his face, but said nothing more.
We returned to our ship, finished the remaining preparations, and boarded a small boat, approaching the giant stone door.
The door had already been opened by the scout team.  
A dazzling array of shimmering mist swirled within.
A portal.
Explorers would recognize it instantly.
But this was the first time I had ever seen a portal of this scale.  I was mesmerized, gazing in wonder.
"Jandel, maybe you should reconsider?" Amelia asked, her voice full of concern.
"We don't know what's inside, but it seems a bit reckless for you to go in first.”
"What are you saying? You’re so weak.”
Barbarians have a tendency to ignore those they deem weaker, you see.
So, in that sense…
"I'll go in first.  Like I said, wait a minute before you enter, just in case."
After exchanging glances with my companions, I stood on the edge of the small boat, ready to leap.
What awaited us inside?
I was a little scared, a little nervous.
But I decided to trust my experience.
Dungeon and Stone was a harsh game, but it rarely featured monsters or traps right outside a portal.
Yes, so….
I took a big leap and plunged into the portal.
A whirlwind of colorful lights enveloped me, and I felt like I was floating.
Then, with a soft thud, I opened my eyes, greeted by darkness.
I wouldn’t be using the barbarian candle mode this time.  After all, what level am I now?
I aimed the flare I had strapped to my waist and fired it, the flames illuminating the area. 
“The place is indoors,” I thought.
The floor was polished marble, walls stretched on both sides, and a ceiling overhead.  
And…
“….”
Monsters were everywhere.  
Or rather, statues, sculpted in the likeness of monsters.
“Death Knight, King Slime, Lycanswolf, Ironclad Knight…,” I recited, identifying them in order.
I quickly realized what these statues represented.
"Rift Guardians," I realized.
The statues, fashioned in the image of Rift Guardians, lined the long corridor, stretching endlessly.
