## The Rift (3)
It's common for players of "Dungeon & Stone" to experience internal strife, and the root of nearly every conflict is always money. While wizards, usually financially secure, prioritize research, adventurers enter the labyrinth solely for profit. This sorceress had just touched that nerve.
"You want to take all the Guardian's spoils?"
The dwarf's friendly smile vanished. His voice deepened, and his eyes, visible through a thick layer of fur, gleamed with a cold intensity.
"Do you think I'm an idiot?"
The air grew frigid instantly. Sensing the tension, the human male placed a hand on his sword hilt. He wasn't just a simple carrier, after all.
Raven broke the heavy silence.
"I will give you all the gemstones found in the rift, in exchange."
"You're basically saying we can have the scraps."
"I believe it's a reasonable calculation. They're not guaranteed drops, after all."
Raven tried to conceal it, but her face revealed her panic. She hadn't anticipated such a hostile reaction. This woman was naive, I thought. Shouldn't she have expected this? The Guardian's loot was the very heart of the rift. And for this dwarf, the "Number Item" would be beyond priceless.
"We cannot compromise on the Number Item."
"Alright, then. I'll take the Guardian's essence.  And I'll concede ownership of any other discoveries that rely on my knowledge."
"Agreed.  We'll split the gemstones fairly, rolling dice."
Fair, my ass.
Ignoring Einar and me, the two of them began their own power struggle. The sight gave me a headache. It would have been better to fight alongside first-floor newbies and clear the rift, even if it meant bloodshed. If this continued, we might just end up with the scraps. Being powerless is truly a miserable thing.
"Bjorn."
"I know what you're thinking, but stay quiet for now."
"Understood."
My purpose was clear. I needed to grow stronger. Whether these greedy bastards kicked away the ladder or not, I would fight my way to the top. Only then could I protect my rights like they did.  Of course, that didn't mean I should give in today.
"Hold on."
".....?"
Both of them, previously engaged in a seemingly amicable negotiation, turned towards me.
"You can do whatever you want with the essence and the Number Item. But we'll take the gemstones."
"You're being greedy."
"Do you think we'll have problems without two barbarians?"
His eyes narrowed. Damn, they were all smiling so kindly when we first met. It was just a shot in the dark, anyway.
"Alright, keep the gemstones. But give us first dibs on two of the Guardian's essences, excluding the Guardian itself."
"Fine, that's reasonable."
"I agree as well."
As expected, Raven and the dwarf easily accepted my demand. That was the final line. They wouldn't find the essences that appealing without the Guardian.
"Shall we proceed, then?"
"Good.  My body is already itching for action! Hahahaha!"
With the negotiations complete, the sorceress and the dwarf, as if nothing had happened, resumed their affable demeanor and laughed heartily.  Terrifying adventurers. 
***
After climbing the mountain path alongside the fortress visible between the ridges, we reached its entrance, greeted by two winged devil statues.
"Gargoyle statues."
8th tier monsters, Gargoyle statues. Normally they remain dormant, but activate upon spotting enemies using the "Petrification" spell.  The standard strategy involves one member sacrificing themselves to absorb all the petrification, and then the rest eliminate the Gargoyles to break the curse.
But luckily, we have a mage. 
"Kyaaah—"
As I approached with the dwarf, the Gargoyle opened its eyes and spread its wings.  My lower body turned to stone at the same time, but the duration was short.
"Artena Viar."
Raven recited a "Curse Release" spell, and the battle began. Einar and I took on one, while the dwarf tackled the other.
Kwang!
The short dwarf swung his hammer like a madman, smashing both of the Gargoyle's legs.  And once the creature fell to the ground, he cracked its head open with a mighty blow.  Is this the Dwarf way? Smashing your opponent from the bottom up, quite the macho method.  Well, we're not much different, I guess.
"You two are quite skilled!"
It didn't take long for us to completely destroy the Gargoyle statues.  We are also adept at close combat.
「Gargoyle defeated. EXP +2」
The two Gargoyles turned into light and vanished, dropping gemstones, but we didn't need to collect them. They automatically flew upwards and dropped into a large bag. 
"I'll collect the gemstones and distribute them periodically."
"That's much appreciated! Hahaha!"
The dwarf didn't seem worried about the mage stealing any gemstones.  Of course, she wouldn't be interested in petty cash like this.
"Let's go!"
The dwarf smashed the old wooden door with his hammer, opening a path.
So, the real dungeon starts now?
I felt a strange sensation as I followed him inside.
"We'll need light."
"Reate."
A sphere of light materialized in Raven's hand, illuminating the dark interior.  The space I was currently in was an outer checkpoint. It would have served various administrative functions like checking the contents of carriages and the identity of passersby before allowing them to enter the fortress.
"Gruuu."
As if attracted by the light and sound, rotten corpses rose from the closets on the wall and under the desks, shambling towards us.
"Deadmen."
Deadmen. They don't even drop experience points, let alone gemstones.  They don't even disappear.  Unless they drop the essence.
"Their attacks are just bites and scratches, so I'll conserve my mana."
Even without magical assistance, we didn't take long to clear the entire room.
"I'll open the door while you two go upstairs, Murad and Jandel."
"We'll be back in a flash! Hahaha!"
Following the dwarf upstairs, we entered a space that resembled a shared dormitory.  There were about ten Deadmen here as well, but the room was larger than the first floor, making it easier to clear.
Pweh! Pweh!
We quickly cleared the second floor and ascended to the roof without any conversation.  There were about a dozen Deadmen soldiers with rusty armor and a slightly larger Deadman commander.
Hardly a first boss, I guess, but a necessary enemy that needs to be defeated for progress.
"He's just big, he's no different from the other Deadmen, quickly take him down! Hahaha!"
Again, we quickly cleared the area, then searched the commander Deadman's clothes to find a horn.  Going back downstairs, the iron gate on the opposite side was already open.
"Having a mage is really reassuring."
The room, previously windowless and dark, was bathed in light from both sides, but it meant nothing.  We had finished our work at the outer checkpoint. Now it was time to cross the bridge, about fifty meters long.
"Be careful on the bridge, Raven."
"Oh, thanks."
The bridge was broken halfway, about twenty meters away from the gate.  Not from wear and tear, but by design.
Pwooowwww!
I blew the horn I had acquired beforehand, and the drawbridge began to slowly descend with a rattling sound.  However, that wasn't the only thing that happened.
「The ancient magic circle of the fortress is activating.」
"Bjorn! Water is rising from below!"
Moat.
Water started rising from the ditch surrounding the fortress wall, built to prevent invasion.  It was thick, black, and red, like blood.  This is why they call this place the "Blood Fortress."  The sky is red, the water is red. But there's one more thing that amplifies the apocalyptic atmosphere.
"Bjorn! Hands!  I see hands flailing on the surface of the water!"
"Don't worry, they're Deadmen."
"Hmph, who said I was worried?"
As the blood filled the bridge from below, the Deadmen flailing on the surface clambered up.  The drawbridge was still only a fifth of the way down.  The concept for this part is simple. 
—Hold your ground until the drawbridge lowers.
That's the message that would have popped up if this was a game.
"Gruu."
While there were no specific instructions, everyone instinctively began to fight back, pushing the Deadmen away or striking them down with their weapons.
Pweh! Pweh! Kwick!
They may be no-tier monsters, but here on the bridge, they were quite troublesome.  If you fall, it's game over.
"I'm done."
After about a minute, Raven completed a magic spell.
"Witerna Dertu!"
Direct translation would be something like "Blade Storm," I guess.  A strong wind burst out from our densely packed formation, shredding the Deadmen like a blender.
Toodootoodootoo.
Looking at the bridge, now stained with the corpses of Deadmen, the dwarf let out a whistle.
“…Impressive.”
"They were just Deadmen."
Despite the humble words, Raven's eyes shone with pride. But it didn't feel like arrogance. This part wouldn't be so easy if we didn't have a mage with a powerful AoE spell.
We continued to stomp the occasional Deadmen that managed to clamber onto the bridge, and then the drawbridge finally met the bridge. 
Kwooong!
The first chapter of the Blood Fortress was over.  And it was ridiculously easy. 
***
We had crossed the drawbridge.  Three chapters left.
* The outer wall city battle.
* The inner wall dungeon.
* The lord's castle, the demon worship chamber.
"This is interesting."
Raven's eyes gleamed as she entered the fortress, seeing the ruins of what was once a city.  Like a treasure trove spread out before her.
"The forge, the tavern, the inn, the church, the stables used by merchants… Most of these ruins seem to be public facilities."
The dwarf chuckled.
"So surprising, Raven?"
"Of course.  There were no farmlands or residential areas on the mountain path we climbed or in the fortress. It means there were no farmers.  Aren't you curious? How did they all make a living in this fortress city built in the remote mountains?"
"Maybe there were alchemists in this dimension, too? Maybe they ate bread made from gemstones, like us? Hahaha."
"That theory is the most prevalent among scholars, indeed."
"Ha! Really?  Even educated people think alike!"
"But Murad, that's not the only interesting thing. The long drawbridge, the high fortress walls, this entire fortress was built with practicality in mind. I wonder who their enemies were?"
The dwarf, initially enthusiastic, started to become dismissive as the conversation continued.
"I can't understand why you're curious about that. It's all just fabricated space."
"Fabricated space, well, sure, people who haven't properly learned dimensional theory might think so—"
"Stop it, Raven. Monsters are coming."
As we walked through the city toward the inner fortress, we soon encountered monsters.  Starting with Deadmen, Skeleton Archers and Mages, Ghouls, and even the 8th tier monster, Deathspind.  The tiers of the monsters were similar to those of the Land of the Dead, but the scale was completely different.  Each pack had at least a few dozen members.
"Everyone gather beside me."
Moreover, as soon as we faced one group, another would approach attracted by the sound.  It took less than a minute from our first encounter for hundreds of monsters to surround us from all sides. 
But then.
The "Blade Storm" we had seen earlier swept through the area again.
Swaaa—!
As expected for a spell meant for clearing out mobs, it didn't wipe out everything like before.  Some Ghouls survived with only a limb or two missing, and Deathspind, the epitome of defense and regeneration, was untouched. 
However.
"I'll leave the remaining monsters to you."
It was undeniable that Raven had done several people's worth of work by wiping out almost nine-tenths of the Deadmen and Skeletons.
"Einar!!"
I called out, and Einar ran towards the Deathspind.  Our target was clear.  The hunting method was...  No need to explain.  A single shared glance was enough.
"Beh—laaaa—!!!"
We were at a level of coordination that we had reached after hundreds of trials.  What I call the (True) Double Barbarian Tackle.
Kung!
We lifted both legs to slam the Deathspind into the ground before smashing its head with a powerful hammer strike.  Seeing this, the dwarf was horrified.
"...You always hunt like this?"
His gaze implied, 'What kind of savages are you?'
"Is there a problem?"
"No, I just find it, uh, quite thrilling, the barbarian way!  Ha, ha, ha!"
I wasn't embarrassed anymore, but it was a little funny.  Dwarf fighting styles aren't exactly known for their elegance.
"Raviod Eheltun."
There were still seven Deathspind, but Raven cast a 'Wounds Aggravating Curse,' making them easy to hunt.  Deathspind without its 'Physical Preservation' passive was hardly a threat. 
"I think I understand why everyone says mages are amazing…."
Einar muttered, his voice filled with defeat.  Raven didn't reply, but I noticed a slight twitch at the corner of her mouth.  She seemed pleased to be admired.
The dwarf added his own comment.
"Ha!  Definitely having a mage changes the scope of what you can do."
I agreed wholeheartedly.  If we were a party of five newbies attempting the 'Blood Fortress,' we wouldn't have been able to engage in a direct confrontation like this.  Even if it took ten times as long, we would have had to slowly whittle down the monster count from the outer edges.
"Hmm, well… that's why I study so hard.  Of course, talent is important, too."
Raven blushed slightly at the continued praise.  Her character was starting to come together.  She's a prodigy mage who seems humble but loves to show off, and she's even more passionate about magic and research.  I'm starting to get a sense of how to deal with her.
"I'm going to explore the area a bit to gather some research material.  Could you all help me if you have time?"
"Of course we can help, Raven, we have plenty of time now. Hahaha!"
"Thank you."
We subsequently searched the city ruins, collecting antiques, books, soil, metal, and the flesh and bones of Deadmen. 
"Thanks to you all, we finished early.  Let's move on to the next area!"
I froze.
Huh? Wait, finished?
We killed all the monsters and searched everywhere. Why didn't they take it?
"What are you doing there!  Come on."
…Do they all not know about it?
The easy-to-find thing that appears when you destroy the fountain statue?
