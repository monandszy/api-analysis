## The Quest for Information (4)
Melbes, the interracial noble alliance. I had secured support for Clan Anabada, including backing for Baron Yandell's estate, while immersing myself in this place.  Technically, the support for the clan was more like a begrudging concession, and the benefits were meager.  They offered us their clan house at a reduced rate for use as our residence, and the ability to take out loans using public funds – a mere pittance in terms of tangible advantages.
"A commission…," I mused.  This made the commission’s importance even greater.  It was a conditional contract, more akin to a barter than a pure benefit.  "The level of success in resolving this commission will determine our standing. It will significantly boost my position too."
It was like an achievement system in a game – completing a quest raised your rank, which in turn granted greater benefits.  Of course, one had to be cautious, making sure one could handle the task before taking it on.
"What kind of commission are you seeking?"
Instead of inquiring about the reward, I opted to understand the task first.
"Information."
"Information...?"
This was wholly unexpected.  Commissions usually fell into one of three categories: hunting, gathering, or combat. Information?
Seeing my questioning glance, Baron Gudricks took a sip of his tea and began to explain.
"Well, you see... a rather significant event transpired recently."
"Stop beating around the bush. Be precise."
Hesitant to speak bluntly in his noble manner, the Baron cleared his throat and spoke decisively. Decisively...?
"I'm referring to the inscription on the Stone of Honor. Upon closer examination, it seems to indicate a hidden region, possibly signifying a new stratum."
I understood what he meant.  With this much information already revealed, it was clear what he wanted from me. 
"Baron Yandell is undoubtedly going to start searching the uncharted regions in his next expedition, isn't he? I'd like it if you shared your findings with us. Whether this hidden region is actually a new stratum, where the entrance is located, how to access it, and what lies within."
Hmm…  As I contemplated, the Baron eagerly added, 
"And as I mentioned earlier, this commission is formally approved by the Melbes Council. Upon completion, you will receive a commensurate reward immediately."
"How much?"
"That depends on the value and rarity of the expedition's findings. We haven't confirmed anything yet, have we?  For all we know, the entrance might be discovered in the next expedition, making it known to every adventurer.  However, if you yield substantial results, the reward will be substantial. Thirteen families have already agreed to participate."
"Thirteen?"
"Everyone's subjective opinions on opportunity can differ. The reward for this commission will be paid with public funds pooled by these thirteen families."
This meant that other families deemed this commission a 'waste'.
"So, this isn't a formal council meeting. You're simply representing them to meet with me."
"That is correct.  Unfortunately, it didn't garner enough votes during the temporary vote.  But, not to worry.  We've received official permission to pool funds and issue this commission separately."
Listening to the convoluted process, I felt the inherent flaws of a council system.  Of course, it had its benefits too.
"So… do you need time to think?"
"Not so much time as I have a few questions."
"Anything."
"What are you planning to do with this expedition information?"
After a short pause, Gudricks Baron seemed to organize his thoughts before answering my question. 
"Do you know what the most expensive 9th grade essence ever sold was, Baron? The Abyssal Essence.  While not superior to other 9th grade essences, it was sold for an astounding 3.2 billion stones.  Do you know why?"
I'd never heard that story, but I had a pretty good guess.
"Because it was the first."
"That is correct.  The Mage Tower purchased this essence for that exorbitant sum simply because it was found in the 9th stratum.  The first instance holds such great value."
When I asked if the money was the goal, the Baron shook his head, dismissing the notion.
"Throughout history, newly discovered areas have always been abundant in treasures and opportunities.  The Sea Dragon Slayer, Mulmarin, is the prime example.  The power and authority he gained from being the first to slay a Sea Dragon is something no one else has ever achieved in the labyrinth."
"So?"
"The information you gain from Baron Yandell will be relayed to trusted adventurers of each tribe."
"You're planning to use this information to help them grow stronger."
"Yes.  The stronger the adventurers of interracial descent become, the stronger we will become."
Though his explanation dragged on a bit, I finally grasped the true motivation behind Melbes issuing this commission.  I understood and found it reasonable.
"Naturally, Baron Yandell might feel uncomfortable sharing his valuable expedition findings with us. But I assure you, the information will only be shared with those we trust, ensuring its secrecy."
With those words, the Baron asked if I would accept the commission. I replied, 
"Very well. I accept the commission."
It wasn't a quest with penalties for failure.  I had nothing to lose by taking it on.
"Then I'll see you later."
After leaving the Baron's residence, I gathered my team to share the details of the new quest.  A few expressed concerns, but no one opposed it.  We could always assess the situation after we discovered the hidden region and confirmed its value.
Tick, tock. 
Late into the night, we discussed future expedition plans before finally retiring to bed. Amelia and Erwen were sitting side by side on the two chairs by my bed.
"Tercia, you don't need to stay here."
"I want to, though. I'm staying here to protect you."
...They weren't exactly 'side by side', were they?
Goodness, it's not like we're going anywhere for that long, why are they all like this.
Tick, tock.
I closed my eyes, counting the seconds of the clock on my bedside table.
"The character's soul resonates and is drawn to a specific world."
Half a month had already passed.

Immediately after waking up in my room, I powered up my computer and logged into the community.
[Great Korea Forever] – 0 members online.
Right, they haven’t logged in yet.
It would be fine to enter after they both joined later, so I first checked the free board.  
As expected, posts were already pouring in.
[Did you guys see the latest patch notes?]
This is really what they meant by feeling like the back of your head was being punched.  Is it actually true that there's still a hidden region?
[BurtusMaximus: The reason ‘Dungeon&Stone’ is the best game ever = It’s a free game over 10 years old, and it still gets patched.]
[ㄴthese99:  But it doesn’t let you go home.]
[ㄴBurtusMaximus: Right. What a truly great game. Send me home, you little shit.]
The patch content was apparently more shocking to the users than it was to the natives.  Considering how recently I’ve caused trouble in the black market and the Mage Tower, it’s surprising that this is the thing that gets the most comments.
[But how did Bjorn get rid of the Lord of Fear to trigger a patch?]
Did he fry him up in a frying pan after he was done?  It's weird that it triggered a patch just because he defeated him.
[Futuralis:  He did a 5-man raid.]
[ㄴAI_DIDIGO: Information 1, It wasn’t a 5-man raid, it was a 4-man raid.]
[ㄴFuturalis:  So, a 4-man raid was the condition?]
[ㄴAI_DIDIGO: Information 2, Bjorn Yandell wasn’t the first to clear it in a 4-man raid.]
[ㄴFuturalis:  So what’s the conclusion?]
[ㄴAI_DIDIGO: Conclusion, there’s a 92.24571% probability that Bjorn Yandell defeated the Lord of Fear after fulfilling specific conditions.]
[ㄴ글쓴이: This guy’s concept is hilarious.]
[ㄴNyacreeps:  But it makes sense. The royal researchers believe there’s a high probability that Gabrilius’s favor was granted under specific conditions.]
Players were coming up with various possibilities about the sudden patch.  I carefully reviewed the posts, hoping to unearth clues by leveraging the collective intelligence. But I still had no idea what these 'special conditions' were.
'Well… does it even matter now?'
After scanning the entire board, I used my mouse to check the chat room.
[Great Korea Forever] – 2 members online.
Okay, so both of them are here on time.
I quickly entered the room, and the two of them greeted me first.
"Hyungnim! You’ve arrived!”
Lee Baek-ho bowed deeply, with an exaggerated gesture.
"Oh, you’re here?"
And Hyun-byeol, who simply glanced at me with a disdainful look.
I passed by them both and sat on the couch. Baek-ho immediately came and sat next to me.
"Hyung! Did you know? We were talking before you came, and Hyun-byeol says she still has feelings for you!”
“………What?”
A truly embarrassing topic to start with.
I swallowed nervously and looked to the side, where I saw Hyun-byeol’s rigid expression.
“…Oppa, I never said anything like that. Don’t believe him.”
"Oh, I know. Of course, I wouldn't believe him.”
"Hyungnim! Are you trying to upset me?  Nui-nim! You’re lying!  Didn’t you blush earlier when I asked you what you’d do if Hyungnim asked you to start dating again?!”
Ah… so that’s what happened.
…Good.
I was worried about how I would face Hyun-byeol in the future.
“…I didn’t blush. And even if I did, how does that relate to what you’re saying?”
"Hoh, silence can be a strong form of affirmation, you know."
"Lee Baek-ho… you’re a total jerk, aren’t you?"
Hyun-byeol stopped responding to Baek-ho’s pranks.  
She just glared at him with sharp eyes.
"Hyun-byeol, stop it.  I don’t believe him anyway.  Baek-ho, stop messing around."
"Yes, sir!"
"I’m so pissed off..."
Baek-ho saluted with a mischievous grin when I mediated the situation.  Hyun-byeol clenched both fists.
‘When did these two get so close?’
I had a question, but I didn't voice it out loud. 
Hyun-byeol would throw another fit if I did. 
This guy, Baek-ho, only shows up in the community once a month, and even then, we only get to see him for an hour. So I need to make the most of our time.
“Hyun-byeol.”
I decided to send Hyun-byeol away first so we could talk.
The moment I called her name, she made a grimace. She must have already guessed what I was about to say.  
Thanks to that, I didn’t have to say much.
“Baek-ho and I have something to talk about… you know?”
“…I’ll be back in an hour.”
With those words, Hyun-byeol glared at Baek-ho once more before leaving the chatroom.
"Whew!  Isn’t she fun? She’s incredibly strong, but she’s all over Hyungnim. What a…"
"Baek-ho."
"Yes?"
"Don't be disrespectful."
“…Okay, I won’t mess around anymore.  Satisfied?”
Ugh… how do I control this guy?
As I was deep in thought, Baek-ho timidly brought up a new topic.
“Anyways, Hyung.”
"Yeah."
"So, did you meet Misha Kalt-stein... I mean, Misha Kalt-stein?"
"Yes. Thanks to you."
We still feel a certain distance from each other, probably due to the passing years, but I think time will eventually solve that.  
Yes, so...
“Anyways, Baek-ho.”
Now that Misha is safely back, I decided to ask a question I hadn’t gotten around to during our last encounter.
"What's a record stone?"
It was time to stop being dragged around by things I didn't understand.
