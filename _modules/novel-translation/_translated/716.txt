## The Prison (3)
Immediately after hearing the news from Raven about the situation aboveground, the first thought that popped into my head was: "It's not too late, is it?"
Of course, less than three minutes had passed since the massive tremor. However, I wasn't sure if this was the real "golden time" to act.
The deafening explosion I heard earlier had already confirmed their "plan." 
It had already begun.
"Maybe…" I mused, "the 'golden time' refers to the period before the plan begins." Perhaps their escape was already underway. When I got down there, there might be no one left.
Or, worse, I might encounter those bastards coming back up, creating a predicament.
But…
*Thud, thud, thud*- I was sprinting down the stairs, ignoring the pain in my legs.
*Crash, bang, boom*- I ripped down the thick iron gates on every floor.
*Still…* I saw the gates remained intact, reinforcing my hope that they were still trapped inside.
*Thud, thud, thud*- I kept running down, reaching the second, third, and fourth floors.
My hope wasn't unfounded. There was definitely a chance that I hadn't missed the "golden time" yet.
"Ha, ha...!" My breath was catching in my throat.
Then, a desperate voice came from behind.
"Hey, Yandell…!! Wait…!"
She told me to run, but she was following me, worried about me.
Should I tell her to go back up now? It might be too late, but…
"She's already down here anyway," I thought. All I needed to do was check the remaining floors.
If they were still shackled inside, I'd just get in quickly and "deal" with them. 
But if they had already escaped…
"Well, at least she'll have some time to run," I thought.
Having made my decision, instead of sending Raven back, I ripped down the final iron gate connecting to the fifth floor. I didn't care what awaited me. A Barbarian wouldn't hesitate.
*Crash*- The gate ripped apart like paper under my immense strength.
Silence greeted me.
…The fifth floor prison was structured in a checkered pattern. Instead of torches requiring constant maintenance, the area was lit by magic tools emitting a soft glow embedded in the ceiling. 
The illumination wasn't bright, just enough to make a person feel gloomy.
Anyway, that wasn't the point…
Left, right, forward.
Three options lay before me.
I didn't know their exact location on the fifth floor, so I had to find them—.
*Thud*.
Ah, no need to search.
"Damn it."
A sound from the front caught my attention. I quickly checked, and there they were, appearing around the corner.
*Click, click.*
Two knights, their names and affiliations unknown, walked in the lead, making metallic sounds as they moved, guiding the way.
And…
“…I knew you'd come.”
Behind them, following like he was being supported, stood the Eye, Barozant.
"Hee hee…"
The other henchmen were there as well.
The situation wasn't ideal, but I accepted and understood the moment I saw them.
Yes, it was too late.
"It looks like they were just waiting here and released as soon as they got the signal…"
However, this fact wasn't fatal.
After all, I hadn't expected much on my way down.
In my experience, if it feels too late, it's usually too late. And…
"I'm glad I came."
It was a place I had to visit, no matter what. 
Those bastards would cause chaos once they got out.
On the bright side, I simply missed my opportunity for an easy win.
Maybe I hadn't lost the "golden time" after all.
*Thud, thud…*
The terrain was favorable.
*Slam*.
I could still stop them.
I could stop them from reaching the city and acting according to their "plan."
"As you know, our duty ends here." 
The two knights leading the group spoke to the vice captain as they continued to guide them.
"From here on, you have to handle it, Eye."
Apparently, they were only helping with the escape from the prison. They had no intention of helping further.
"Ha, ha… Hey, Yandell?"
Right on cue, Raven arrived at that moment.
Well, perhaps not "right on cue."
"Ha, ha… You stopped… You finally decided to go back… Hic!"
She saw me and briefly felt hope, but she fainted after noticing the front, which had been hidden from view by my massive body.
"Th, those guys, how did they…?"
What how?
Someone with connections to the royal power released them, so they're outside.
"It looks like they even got their equipment back," I thought.
No wonder they were still on the fifth floor. 
They must have taken some time to get back into their gear.
*Thud.*
Barozant, the Eye, slowly walked forward between the two knights, who had stepped aside.  He quietly asked, looking at me.
"Are you going to stop us? Alone?"
Well, 
"What do you think?"
I chuckled and asked back. He stared at me silently.
Those hateful, dead eyes that never saw humans as humans.
Perhaps it was because of the lesson I gave him last time?
"Hmm, I think you…"
He guessed right this time.
"It seems you're making another foolish choice."
I disagreed with the term "foolish", but it was true.  He had predicted my next action.
So, 
…I raised the Aegis Barrier.
And activated [Enlargement], using my body to block the entrance, the only passage leading to the surface.
Then...
"Yandell, this is too reckless—!"
I cut off Raven's expression of worry.
"You go up first. I'll hold them off. There's no need for you to risk your life."
After a short pause, she responded.
"Are you really going to keep saying those hurtful things? If that's what you were going to do, you shouldn't have come down here in the first place."
"Oh…"
"Are you going to stand your ground?  So those guys can't do anything bad by going up?"
"That's…"
"I'll help. I might not be much help in this situation, but you know I learned some auxiliary spells while I was in the military?"
"Hmm…"
Her voice was devoid of hesitation. 
Something felt like it was filling my chest, and I thought: "What should I say?"
Should I decline, saying it's unnecessary? Or should I promise to repay her later? 
The deliberation wasn't long.
"Raven,"
"Yes?"
"Always... thank you."
…She didn't respond to my heartfelt gratitude, but I didn't ask for a reply. 
It would have been embarrassing if she did. Besides, the others were watching us with inquisitive looks.
“…Are we done? Hee hee."
That creepy smile again.
I looked ahead and saw the Noark bastards slowly approaching me.
The Corpse Collector.
The Screaming Witch.
The Eye.
And others, including a bespectacled man whose name I didn't know, but who looked like he had skills.
"How long can I hold them off?"
I dismissed the thought as soon as it crossed my mind.
"Behe—laaaaaaaaaa!!!”
Come.
I don't care what you're planning. I won't let you have your way—!
*BOOM!!!*
The ground shook again, violently shaking the entire underground space, this time coming from the surface.
*Rumble, rumble, rumble…*
This was far more intense than before. 
The pillars, already damaged from the previous tremors, were now on the verge of collapse. It was just a matter of time.
*Rumble, rumble, rumble!!*
This was practically a ticking time bomb.
"Randolph, is the multi-teleportation magic ready?"
...Huh?
"Yes. The magic nullification formation was deactivated as of this moment. It can be activated at any time."
…What?
"Activate it."
"But if we do that, we can't use the plan of releasing other prisoners."
"It's strategically disadvantageous to waste more time here."
"Understood."
They continued their conversation, and a blue light suddenly burst from under their feet.
The situation was clear.
"No, they weren't staying on the fifth floor because of their equipment?" 
I didn't know what was going on, but if this continued, they would escape right under our noses.
The weakness of Mass Teleport is its long activation time and vulnerability to interruption.
But it seemed like they were ready.
I couldn't give up, though…
*Thud*.
I quickly dashed forward, pushing off the ground.
I might be a tank, but a top-tier explorer's physique was enough to quickly close the distance.
Well, if there weren't any obstacles.
*Roland Barozant casts [Green Eye].*
The vice captain's irises turned green, even as I, a tank-sized Barbarian, was charging.
And in that instant…
*WHOOSH-*
A translucent green barrier rose between us, blocking my path.
*CRASH!*
I swung my hammer, but the wall didn't even crack. 
It was the same even when I swapped my weapon to the No. 687 Siege Slaughterer…
*BOOM!!!*
I hammered the wall again and again, but it wouldn't budge. 
And as I did, the already precarious ceiling began to crumble, signaling the imminent collapse of the building.
But I didn't care. I kept swinging my mace.
*WHOOSH!!!*
The blue light beyond the wall intensified, signaling the imminent completion of the magic.
*BOOM!*
Barozant, the Eye, watched me relentlessly hammering the unyielding wall. He spoke, as if giving advice to a foolish young man.
"Baron Yandell, this isn't the time for this. Stop wasting your strength and hurry."
Then, his dull, lifeless eyes looked past my shoulder.
I knew what he was about to say.
After all…
"They say you care deeply for your companions."
*RUMBLE, RUMBLE, RUMBLE-*
The building was collapsing in earnest.
***
A massive piece of debris from the crumbling ceiling hit my shoulder.
That was the moment I stopped swinging my mace.
I had to admit it.
I couldn't stop them from escaping right now.
But…
"I don't know what you're planning," I said. 
"But you won't get what you want."
Barbians are specialized in ruining things.
“…We'll see.”
He tried to be cool.
"Well, it’s done."
I had said what I had to say.
*Thud-*
Immediately, I turned and sprinted towards the stairs where Raven was.
*Flash!*
There was a flash of light from behind, but I didn't turn back.
There wouldn't be anyone left anyway. 
My priority was to get Raven to safety.
"Yandell! The stairs up are blocked!"
"…What?"
I held Raven and checked the stairs. The way up was completely blocked.
"Ugh, now I have to break through this one by one?" 
I sighed, but there was no time for despair.
Without wasting a moment, I headed towards the stairs.
I was about to start clearing away the debris with my bare hands, but…
"Yandell, it's too late!"
Too late…?
Well, it might look that way.
"So you're saying we should just die here?"
For a K-Barbarian, surrender is like counting kimchi—
"No, I didn't mean that! Let's go down!  We can escape using the multi-teleportation magic!"
Ah…?
Is that an option?
"Just buy us time until the spell is ready!"
Why didn't I think of that? Why did I jump into action first?
I felt a bit embarrassed, like I was becoming a Barbarian down to my brain, but it was definitely the best option.
Therefore…
*Rumble, rumble, rumble-*
I ran back down the crumbling stairs, heading for a spot where we could hold out until the spell was activated.
"Over there!"
Raven pointed to the corner furthest from the entrance.
I saw that some thick pillars had collapsed, creating a space large enough to hide two people.
"Okay, if we hold our ground here, we'll be safe until the spell is activated—."
As I ran toward the passage,
…Huh?
…Eh? Aaaaaaaaaack!!!
The floor gave way.
And…
*WHOOSH!*
When I regained consciousness, I saw an unfamiliar ceiling.
Well, "regain consciousness" might be an exaggeration.
I wouldn't faint just because I fell after the floor collapsed while running.
I was a Barbarian. My body was tough.
I felt my heavy foot land on the ground.
The ground, already cracked, crumbled beneath me.
Even as I fell, I twisted my body to protect Raven, whom I was still holding, ensuring she landed on my back.
I saw everything clearly, like slow-motion playback, and I remember it all.
But the question is…
"This is…"
I could feel it with my whole body. This place was safe.
Somehow, the entire upper level was collapsing, but the space where I landed was still intact, undisturbed. 
The only sign of collapse was a small hole in the ceiling caused by my fall…
"Underground… Floor 6...?"
The royal dungeon was supposed to end on the fifth floor.
It was like that in the game, and in reality, there weren't any stairs going down from the fifth floor.
I had never heard of an expansion to the royal dungeon either.
"Wait, but…"
…Can we even call this a dungeon?
A massive space with a cubic structure.
There wasn't even an entrance to this place, let alone bars. In the center of the space stood a single cubic structure.
It was like a matryoshka doll, a box within a box.
…
What is this place?
They wouldn't create a meaningless space like this and hide it so well.
"Raven, wake up. Hurry."
I quickly roused the mage to find out.
Fortunately, she seemed to have only fainted from the fall, as she regained consciousness the moment I shook her.
"He, here…"
"I fell and ended up here. Do you know anything I should know?"
With a dazed look, Raven glanced around the space, her gaze settling on the cubic structure in the center.
"Do you know what that is?"
I shook her shoulder again, asking.  She replied, her voice lacking confidence.
"Well, I don't know for sure…."
"But?"
"There… seems to be a portal inside…."
What is this place?
