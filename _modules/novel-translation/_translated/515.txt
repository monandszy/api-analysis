## The Evil Spirit's Playground (515)
A ridiculous situation unfolded: the monster claimed to be human, calling us, in turn, the demons. 
"This is interesting," I remarked.
"Interesting? What did this thing say?" Erwin asked, intrigued.
"It claims we're demons and it's human."
"Oh... a foolish demon, then?" Ainar chuckled, her amusement contrasting with the varied reactions of others. 
Some, like myself, found it entertaining. Others were curious. Still, others, like Erwin, displayed a touch of annoyance. Surprisingly, Bersil, the magician, remained unaffected. Perhaps it was due to her past as a player? If Raven had been here, she would have gone mad, demanding we immediately question its reasoning.
"What... what are you all saying?" the little monster asked, addressing me directly. 
It seemed the creature wasn't completely oblivious after all.
"We were discussing your claim of being human," I replied.
"Is there anything to discuss about that?"
"Not really, I suppose."
"Who are you?" it inquired.
I pondered the question, searching for a term encompassing humans, barbarians, elves, beastmen, and all beings alike.
"We are explorers."
"Explorers…?"
"Why? Never heard that term before?"
The little monster raised its right hand and pointed its index finger downwards.  It seemed this was a common gesture for nodding in its culture.
"Explorers… what's exploring?"
"It means searching for the new and slaying demons while navigating the labyrinth."
"So... you are from outside the island, then?"
"Indeed."
I nodded my index finger downwards, and the little monster responded with two quick nods.  
This is actually quite fun.
"I think we'll be having a long conversation, so everyone be alert," Erwin instructed. 
"Understood."
First, we adjusted our formation into a defensive posture.  Then, to facilitate a harmonious discussion, I initiated a charm offensive.
"Want to eat?"
"What's that?"
"It's jerky, dried meat."
"I didn't ask about that."
"Huh?"
I tilted my head in confusion, and the creature, as if genuinely confused, asked again, "What do you mean... eat?"
My mind went blank for a moment. This didn't seem like the type to be playing pranks in this situation. So I explained, "To eat means to chew food with your teeth and swallow it down your throat."
Like this.
To demonstrate, I grabbed a piece of jerky and chewed it loudly before swallowing.  The little monster grimaced.
"Ugh, that's disgusting. Teeth are only for killing enemies…"
"So you don't eat anything?"
"Of course! How can anyone... put that kind of thing... in their body?"
It's weird hearing that kind of thing from someone who looks like that…
"We, we sometimes swallow things unknowingly during a fight, but… usually not!"
This is quite interesting. Or should I say, this part is similar to a monster?
"So you can survive without eating anything?"
"Of course. As long as we can drink enough lifeblood, we humans can survive."
"Lifeblood…?"
When I expressed my doubt, the creature pulled a porcelain bottle out of the bag it was wearing. It swallowed the contents in one gulp.
"This is lifeblood."
"Can you spare some?"
"........ Yes."
It seemed reluctant to share, but it offered the bottle, perhaps aware of its current predicament.
Okay, so the sample is acquired.
"Bersil, do you know what this is?" Erwin asked.
"Let me see… the magical density is very high…."
I handed it over,  unsure, but Bersil identified it immediately.
"This... seems like crushed magic stone mixed with water."
"Magic stone?"
"Yes. The magical water commonly used in cities is made like this. It's exactly the same."
Magical water is an essential material used in making various magical tools.
But, using it as a staple food…
"Hey, is this lifeblood made with magic stones, or… stones, from slain demons?" I inquired.
"Yes… but so what? And don't call me 'Hey.' My name is Maru Peachichi."
"Alright, Maru Peachichi. I am Bjorn, son of Jandel."
".....Strange name."
Maru Peachichi…
Maru, as I assumed it was short for, said that while timidly extending its index finger. I reciprocated, meeting its finger with mine.
"What are you doing… with that monster?" Erwin questioned.
"I don't know. It seems like a handshake."
"What information have you gotten? Did you find out where the village is?"
Oh, right. I should have done that. I got too caught up in the fun and ended up having useless conversations.
"I've been asking, but…"
"Right… even a child won't reveal that kind of crucial information to an enemy. If you need my help, tell me."
"Okay."
I finally put my personal curiosity aside, focusing on the important information.
"Maru Peachichi, where is the entrance to your village?"
Despite Amelia's concerns, Maru, who was kind enough to free a captive with his own hands, wouldn't resort to cowardly tactics like exercising his right to remain silent.  
Though his answer wasn't what I hoped for.
"There isn't one... right now."
"Huh?"
"No one can enter the village until the elders open it... including me...," he explained.
Ah, so that's why he was hiding in the forest alone.
"Is it typical to close the entrance?"
"No... We rarely close it except during the rainy season."
Rainy season… does it actually rain here?  
Of course, it would be a problem if the village was underground during heavy rain.
"But why is it closed now?"
"It's probably because of me."
"Because of you?"
"Yes. The elders think the demons I brought were running away...," he said.
No, in that case, they should send a pursuit team, why close the village entrance?  It was my first thought. But on second thought, it made sense. 
The villagers(?) wouldn't know that we escaped. They would assume we were hiding within the village, and they would be sealing the entrance while conducting a search.
"They escaped about four hours ago, so they should be realizing the situation and coming out soon…."
I shared the information we gathered with my companions. And then, the vote began.
"The topic is 'How to treat a demon who can communicate and claims to be human'. We have two choices."
"Two choices?" Amelia asked, puzzled.
I nodded my index finger up and down. "Become friends."
Or else...
"Kill them all."
Either choice would be a true explorer's decision. 
***
"Friends… with a demon?"
Some were baffled. Others were skeptical about its feasibility.
"But why do you want to become friends?" Erwin questioned.
"Since they live here, they might know a lot."
"Can't we just ask that demon?"
I doubt this little one knows that much. Ultimately, to gain higher-level information, we need to communicate with the adult demons.
Amelia remained skeptical, however. "If that's the reason, we can just catch an adult demon and interrogate it."
"We could, but it might not be easy. This one was easy to talk to because he's a child, but the adults might not be."
"You… don't trust me?"
"Of course I do. It's just that we don't have to resort to drastic measures. We don't even know how strong they are yet. But… weren't we just saying that we should not kill them randomly?"
"That was when it was human."
"Ah."
"Let's get to the point. What are you going to do if becoming friends fails?" Amelia asked, getting straight to the point.
I didn't hesitate to answer.  After all, there were only two options. If A doesn't work, we go with B.
"Kill them all."
"I see. Then I vote for becoming friends."
"That's surprising."
"I'm a little curious about them too."
In any case, the vote began with Amelia.
And…
"Three for becoming friends. Three for killing them all."
As if by fate, the outcome was determined by my choice again.
I turned my gaze to Maru Peachichi, about to make my decision.
Suddenly, a piercing sound cut through the air. The body of a warrior, always ready for battle, instinctively responded to the threat. 
Who, where, why. 
Before my mind could process the information, my body moved first. 
An arrow, its origin unknown, embedded itself into my shield, which covered my upper body.
Frankly, I was a little surprised. 
"It… it actually pierced."
The arrow didn't penetrate deeply, but it did pierce through the plywood of my shield.  And from what I saw, it seemed like a 100% physical damage attack.
"Prepare for battle!" I instinctively shouted, confirming the arrow's direction. 
Just as I expected, monsters armed with various weapons emerged from the forest.
"Their objective is… to rescue this kid."
Probably, they shot the arrow to create an opening.
I immediately discarded my shield, understanding their intentions.  Then, I extended my arm and grabbed Maru Peachichi by the scruff of the neck.
"Ack!" he yelped, struggling like my shield would. 
But it was an effective replacement nonetheless.
The monsters, appearing like a special forces unit, froze momentarily upon seeing my new shield.
"You coward…."
"Taking a child hostage…."
They showered me with praise, unable to get closer nor stay too far.
"M, Maru Peachichi!," Maru yelled, "Daddy!"
"Don't worry, sir. We will save you."
Now that I think about it, they seem to know this kid.
"But why are they using honorifics? Is he of high status?"
If that's the case, all the better.
Raising the monster shield I had just acquired, I shouted, "Drop your weapons, all of you! Or this kid's life is forfeit!"
Amelia, beside me, muttered softly, "Unexpected. I thought you were on the 'become friends' side."
"What? I am on the 'become friends' side." I replied with a natural, carefree smile.
"....This… thing?"
"Ahem."  
Even for her, calling a child 'this thing' is a little harsh.
"...Well, you know, everyone makes friends through fighting."
We did, didn't we?
***
Silence reigned. 
"He spoke human language."
"The demon... how does it speak our language?"
"Could it be… what the village chief said…."
Dozens of monsters stared at me, unable to immediately drop their weapons nor attack.
I maintained a combat stance, patiently waiting.
After about a minute…
The hunter, a monster whose height must have been at least 3.5 meters, emerged from the forest, a huge bow slung over his shoulder.
He was the archer, wasn't he?
"Are you the leader?" I asked, breaking the silence.
"Demon, how do you speak our language?" the archer shot back.
"Drop your weapons. I'll tell you if you do."
Surprisingly, my shield answered. 
"D, Daddy! Please, don't! It's okay… I'm okay…."
Wow… he was his dad, huh?
"Did you see? Bjorn is wearing a wicked smile! Now those demons are all dead! Hahaha!"
Did I actually laugh? 
I wasn't sure, but I managed my expression and focused on the conversation.
"Don't interfere.  Chi Chi," the archer commanded.
"But..."
"I said stay quiet!"
"..."
The shield, my new shield,  became silent after the archer's reprimand.
Right, no need for children to butt in on adults' conversations.
"I'm warning you for the last time. If you want your son to live, drop your weapons and…"
"Demon, I want to invite you to the village."
"......What?"
I thought I misheard, but I hadn't.
"I said I want to invite you to the village. Don't you understand? It's not a difficult word."
This isn't about the vocabulary, is it? 
"You think I'd accept an invitation in this situation?"
Judging by the archer's level, this race shouldn't be underestimated either.
We're outnumbered. And if I were ambushed in this isolated place, there's a high chance things could get ugly.  It's a preposterous offer unless our safety is secured or trust is established.
"Rejecting the invitation… barbaric."
"Hanging bodies from trees is humane?"
"...The ones brought to the village are all safe. Don't be wary. We won't harm you."
How can I trust you?
"If you want, you can keep my son…."
"I refuse."
My firm refusal led the archer to stop arguing further.  He simply made a strange request instead.
"Could you wait for a little while? Just a short time."
Is he going to call for reinforcements?
Though a little anxious, I agreed to his request.  Maybe it was my misconception, but I didn't feel much hostility from them.
"Maybe they're acting differently because they know I can speak their language."
As we maintained this tense standoff, about ten minutes passed.
"The village chief is here…."
"Make way, everyone."
Whispers arose from behind, and the warriors parted like the Red Sea, creating a path.
A monster with a white beard that reached below his chin walked toward us, leaning on a staff.
"Welcome. What is your name?"
His tone was oddly gentle.
"Bjorn, son of Jandel."
"Good name. Nyachichi! Lead the warriors back! I have much to discuss with these people!"
I didn't know much about the culture of these monsters who called themselves human, but the villagers obeyed the village chief's order without any objections, distancing themselves from us. 
"Ah, sorry.  They wouldn't appreciate this conversation."
"They…?"
The strange word made me tilt my head, but the village chief simply smiled with his excessively prominent fangs.
"My apologies, I haven't introduced myself. I am Bryungrid, the village chief of this place."
"Bryungrid?"
This name sounds familiar.
"Emily, do you know the name Bryungrid?"
"I remember a name like that belonging to one of the Great Sage's companions."
Ah, so that's why it sounded familiar.
Turning my attention back to the village chief, I continued our exchange.
He extended his hand.  "Don't be wary. I simply wish to shake hands."
"Ah…"
I forced a smile and shook his hand. 
And then I realized. 
"You said you are Bjorn, son of Jandel, didn't you?"
The village chief spoke.
Not in the ancient language, but in the Lapdonian language.
"Welcome indeed. You must be an explorer from Lapdonia."
What is this?
"Yes. How much time has passed in the outside world?"
What is this guy's true identity?
