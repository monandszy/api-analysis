##  Chapter 610: Mystery (3)
There was no uproar when I announced we’d be weathering the storm here.  It was something everyone expected, really.  We had been investigating here for several days before the storm even began.  If we had wanted to avoid it, we should have left long ago.
Was it the calm atmosphere around me that made the head of the investigation team say this?
“I apologize for asking a foolish question.  I’ve been so focused on the investigation lately, my thinking has been shallow.”
He spoke with an embarrassed expression.
“There's no need to apologize.  Everyone on the team knows how hard you’ve been working.”
I continued the meeting, checking for any disagreements. Fortunately, none of the senior members had any objections.
It wasn’t that they were intimidated by my authority.  Most of them simply didn’t see the storm as a major threat.
After all, they’d already experienced it once.
From the Library Island to the Village Chief Island.  Though our journey began on the third day of the storm, we had successfully reached our destination without a single casualty.
“Considering the supplies we consumed back then, it’s best to avoid the storm whenever possible.  However, if we can’t, then there’s no reason to avoid it.”
“However, remember that mages will be significantly weakened for at least several days after the storm ends.  Please consider this carefully.”
“Yes, if we have to fight another enemy immediately after the storm, their absence would be a huge loss.”
The sole topic of our discussion was:
Not how to avoid the storm, or how to stop it, but how to minimize damage and successfully weather the storm.
We tossed back and forth various ideas and strategies for a long time until finally, we arrived at Plan A.
But we weren’t satisfied with Plan A, and we continued to brainstorm.
And….
Plan B, Plan C, Plan D….
We continued to develop contingency plans for every possible scenario.
It was an advantage of being a group known as the King's Army.
Since errors are unacceptable, we prepare for every possible outcome.
Ah, I wish our Clan members would learn from this mindset….
“Alright, that’s all for the meeting.  Everyone go back to your posts and prepare according to what we discussed today.”
The meeting finally ended after several hours, and we all dispersed, diligently preparing for each plan until the storm arrived.
How much time had passed?
콰직-!
A monster from the sky crashed against the barrier, shattering into pieces, signaling the start of the storm.
At the same time.
“I guess Plan C is out of the question.”
One of the options disappeared from the start.
***
If the core of Plan A was to stay on the ship with a barrier and endure the storm by consuming supplies, Plan C was the opposite.
It was a backup plan, in case we faced an insurmountable enemy or trial.
In other words, an escape plan.
Incidentally, Plan C could also be linked with Plan D, which involves circling the surrounding waters and returning here right before the storm ends.
Well, C or D, it’s all meaningless now.
쿠아아아아아앙-!
With a deafening roar, silvery waves rise, connecting with the sky as they circle the windless zone where we stand.
“This is outrageous….”
The sight was so overwhelming, even the veteran members of the exploration team stared in disbelief.
But they soon snapped out of it, realizing the gravity of the situation.
“This is…”
“This is incredibly dangerous, isn’t it?”
The vast expanse of the sea, where three large warships and one medium ship could comfortably anchor, became a confined space in an instant.
Even those sturdy warships, known for their strength, couldn’t possibly break through those waves and escape.
“Calm down, everyone! Stay at your posts! Nothing’s changed! If everyone does their part, there won’t be any problems!”
The deputy commander, who had regained his composure, shouted to quell the chaos, taking my place.
“Nothing has changed, huh…?”
He might have said that to try and restore order, but he also knew deep down.
It wasn’t ‘nothing has changed.’ It was ‘not yet.’
Nothing has changed yet.
The escape route is merely blocked, and we still have to endure the storm for seven days.
But…
The waves surging up and blocking the escape route.
Is that the end of this event?
I don’t think so.
I wasn’t particularly worried though.
Even during the meeting.
And now, at the start of the storm.
My goblin’s instinct wasn’t activated.
So, in other words….
“Behel—raaa—aaa—aaa—aaa—aa—a—a—aa!!!”
I leaped from my captain’s seat, heading to the railing.  I swung my hammer at the monsters clambering onto the ship.
“My lord!!!”
The deputy commander, seeing me join the fray, exclaimed, but I ignored him. If something important happens, he’ll tell me himself.
“Please come back quickly… If you go there, who will lead us?”
Well, I can lead from here too.
Leading from the midst of a battle, drenched in blood and sweat.
Not an easy job, but something I’ve always done.
“I can lead from here, so you just keep reporting the situation!”
Realizing it was futile to try and stop me, the deputy commander calmed himself down and took on the task as I wished.
Reports on the number of casualties.
Supply consumption rate.
The level and characteristics of the monsters appearing, and so on.
He relentlessly relayed information to me, and thankfully, there were no unusual occurrences yet.
So, I focused more on the battle.
콰직-!
As time passed since the storm began, there were more and more monsters trying to climb onto the ship.
As the level of the monsters increased, the number of individuals that survived even after falling from the sky continued to grow.
“It’s my turn, my lord!”
As the battle dragged on, all of us, including myself, rotated combat duties, distributing our stamina.
Of course, the mages were an exception.
Though excluded from combat, the mages were constantly channeling their magic, burdened with the vital task of maintaining the barrier.
Most of the magic could be replenished by pouring magic stones into the magic circle, but magic doesn’t function solely on magic stones.
One day, two days…
Time passed, and we reached the third day.
The number of casualties so far was two.
With the storm’s intensity, fierce battles were inevitable in the early stages, making casualties unavoidable.
However, there were no casualties due to injuries that incapacitated them.
If it wasn’t an instant kill, our powerful healers would somehow drag them back from the brink of death.
“This seems… to be going smoothly?”
Contrary to my initial concerns of unexpected incidents with the towering waves, this storm-weathering plan was proceeding smoothly.
As for the two deaths….
If you’re unlucky, you can even die while fighting goblins in this industry.
Though my heart was heavy, I had to shake it off and move forward as a true explorer.
“But… is this really it?”
The storm had already passed its peak and was gradually weakening.
Was it because of that?
My mind was slowly becoming poisoned by complacency.
While still wary of any unknown variables, I was starting to feel that the storm might truly end like this.
“Actually… enduring the storm outside with no protection is incredibly challenging…”
If I told our Clan members to do it without the exploration team, they wouldn’t even attempt it—it’s that insane.
No, even with the same members, if we didn’t have this crazy warship, there would have been countless casualties.
And thinking about it that way….
“…Is this the right level of difficulty?”
As those nonchalant thoughts grew stronger, I actually became more wary.
Isn’t it the same with driving?
You’re more likely to get into a bigger accident when you have some confidence but aren’t a complete novice.
But…
Day three, day four, day five…
We had already passed the halfway point, and no further events occurred.
It wasn’t easy, though.
“There’s been a casualty in the second squad.”
There was another death on the sixth day.
Compared to the fierce battles of the early stages, it seemed much more relaxed, but difficulty is always relative.
The number of monsters had decreased, but our condition wasn’t perfect.
We were all exhausted from fighting day and night, barely getting any sleep.
“Any deserters?”
“Three.”
Even after being healed by priests, some were too exhausted to get up…
Perhaps that’s why…
“Damn it.”
Finally, an incident happened in our fourth squad, which had previously been casualty-free.
One of the mages, drained like a dried squid, caused the barrier to temporarily collapse.
콰지직-!
Besides the major damage to the ship caused by the falling monster…
“Retrieve the bodies.”
One member of the Armin Exploration Team and two members of the Hect Clan were instantly killed.
“Reverse summon the ship and everyone gather on the first ship.”
We finally had to resort to Plan E.
While the monsters also have the drawback of not being dispersed, we had no other choice in the current situation.
After all, hadn’t we lost one ship already?
The magic stone consumption during the first and second day was so high that our massive reserves were running low.
“It’s killing me to endure all seven days straight.”
Perhaps we were a bit overconfident because we didn’t have any casualties last time.
Enduring from the third day onwards is completely different from enduring all seven days without a break.
But, the silver lining was…
Day seven.
We reached the final day, and until the minute and second hands aligned at the exact time, no other events occurred.
[00:00]
The storm finally ended.
But, unlike before, there were no cheers from the gathered members.
“….”
“….”
They were all exhausted, scattered across the deck, stained with monster blood, breathing heavily.
“Is it over…?”
“It doesn’t even matter if it’s not.  I can’t move anymore….”
I wanted to praise them for their hard work, but I decided to put it off for later and looked up at the sky.
“It should be starting soon.”
Why isn’t anything happening?
That thought bloomed in my mind.
 번뜩—!
As if to bless us for enduring the trials, a radiant rainbow light enveloped us.
***
삐삐삐삐- 삐삐삐삐- 삐삐삐삐-!
A mechanical beeping sound could be heard nearby.
I opened my eyes, and saw a flying object gliding in front of the ship's railing.
Or rather….
 드드드드드-!
A drone hovering in place.
“What the hell is this?”
Even in my dazed state, I instinctively grabbed my hammer and rose to my feet.
Then….
 드드드드드드-!
Sensing my hostile intent, the drone, which had been observing me head-on, flew through the air and disappeared into the jungle.
“Where the hell are we…?”
“Is everyone alright?!”
“Everyone, prepare for combat!”
The members, despite their exhaustion, sensed something amiss and quickly rose to their feet.
“Wait a minute… are we in a jungle?”
I rushed to the railing and checked the surroundings.
This wasn’t a river mouth.
The warship we were on was in the middle of a dense jungle where no sounds of water could be heard.
And….
“Sir! Look! There’s a building! A building over there!”
Erwen, having climbed onto the watchtower, pointed somewhere and raised her voice.
“You should see this!”
Was it because the ship was so large?
The trees weren’t small, but as I climbed up using the ropes tied to the sails, my vision widened.
“Over there, over there!”
Following Erwen’s pointed finger, I saw a structure built in a rhombus shape like a pyramid… reminiscent of a temple.
Seeing it instantly brought to mind a specific location.
One of the fields of the seventh floor, the Dark Continent.
A field where “machine” type monsters, a rarity in the labyrinth, frequently spawned.
If I wasn’t mistaken.
“The Pantheon Ruins.”
The place we had woken up in was very similar to that location.
