## Outsider (5)
A vast circular passage. As I walked along the path opposite the wall where the magic circle was drawn, the passage gradually narrowed. 
"Hey… I'm not curious about the outside at all…"
Thump, thump.
"Exploration is something for the other companions. Why don’t we just go back today?"
Thump, thump.
"H-how can you do this! Let me go!"
I thought there was no way out of this situation, but the tone of the GM, who had been dragged along almost like a kidnapping, gradually became harsher. 
Ah, of course, from a Barbarian's perspective, it was still cute. 
Like a chick chirping, perhaps?
"Yurben Havelion."
I released her arm and looked at her.
"…Why, why are you looking at me like that?"
"Give me your time for a few days. Meeting like this is fate in a way, wouldn’t it be nice if we got to know each other?"
"If it’s for social reasons, I can always spare time, but…"
She can always spare time, huh?
The moment I let her go, she’ll just stay in the magical tower and never come out.
"But it’s strange."
"Yes?"
"Why are you whining so much about going back? You’re a magician, aren’t you curious about the outside?"
"…I question only what I can handle."
It was a quite impressive principle.
If you want to live a long, thin life, there’s no easier or faster way than closing your eyes and ears.
‘…Perhaps this is the secret to how she’s survived so long.’
It felt as though I understood the person called the GM a little better through that single statement. 
Well, not that I’m planning on letting her go just like that.
"Still, help me for a little while. Okay? For Versil’s sake, please."
It might sound like a plea using her acquaintance with Versil, but from the GM’s perspective, it would sound like a threat.
"Ahem…"
"I’ll make a promise too. If anything dangerous happens, I’ll throw myself in front of it to protect you. Okay? And it won’t take days, I’m just going to check things quickly and come back."
"If you say so…"
As soon as I offered the carrot too, the GM nodded as if she couldn’t resist.
Okay, so that problem is solved…
"Then let’s keep moving."
After the agreement, we walked along the passage again.
The passage that had been gradually narrowing didn't narrow further beyond a certain point. After walking for a while in that state, the passage gradually widened, and a sloping path appeared.
And…
Whooooosh-!
As I climbed up the hill, I felt the wind, and slowly, light began to seep in.
Though it might have been a matter of feeling, it seemed slightly different from the nature I felt in the city.
[Character has entered a forbidden area.]
Having finally emerged, I took a deep breath and slowly looked around.
A sunset partially hidden by mountains in the distance.
A stream colored red by the setting sun.
A bird had built its nest on a tree and chirped.
And…
"That must be Lafdonia…"
A huge, high wall was visible in the far distance, on the opposite side of the sunset.
How high it was and how wide it stretched sideways, it was like looking at the Great Wall of China, so long that I couldn’t see the end…
‘It's my first time seeing it from the outside.’
I had never gone outside the wall while playing the game, so it felt very strange to be looking at Lafdonia from this angle—
"Havelion, what are you doing?"
"I was just looking around. I saw some strange writing I’ve never seen before…"
Strange writing?
I tilted my head and approached the entrance of the cave we had just emerged from. On the smooth wall, there was a mark that looked like it had been made with a knife.
[Came and Went.]
[Lee Baekho, the Korean Man of Virtue.]
Ugh… why am I feeling so embarrassed?
I almost let out a dry laugh, but I held it in and pretended not to know, opening my mouth.
"…It doesn't seem like ancient writing, but it’s peculiar."
"Yes. It is peculiar. It’s like I’ve seen it somewhere before, but…"
The GM didn’t seem to know much about Korean, which was understandable.
I wouldn’t know what language it was if I suddenly saw something like Hebrew, either.
Swish.
As I was looking at the graffiti left by Baekho, the GM gave me a piece of advice.
"If you’re thinking of leaving your name, it’s best not to do so. It’ll be proof that you came out. If the royal family sees it, they might interpret it as treason."
"…I wasn’t even thinking of it."
"Then that’s good."
Watching the GM nod, I turned my back and licked my lips.
"…"
Why do I want to leave my mark too?
***
According to the clown, the world outside the wall has a structure similar to the 7th layer of the labyrinth, the Dark Continent.
Where are we now then?
I think we need to find something we can use as a reference point…
‘If that’s the Dragon Mountains, then maybe we’re near the Great Forest?’
If so, it gives us a rough idea of our current location.
The Great Forest is located in the southeast of the Dark Continent.
And it seems like we’re even further east from the Great Forest…
‘So, we’re somewhere around the eastern part of the Great Forest?’
Of course, it’s all just speculation, and I can’t be sure.
The atmosphere is completely different from the labyrinth, so I’m not sure.
‘Anyway, let’s figure that out later…’
"But… where are we going now?"
To the GM's question about our plans, I answered without a moment’s hesitation.
"First, we’re going towards the city."
"The city… you say?"
"Why that expression?"
"Honestly, I thought you’d head straight for the forest, given that you’re a Baron."
Well… honestly, I am curious about that forest.
However, it was risky for just the two of us to go too far, and I had something I wanted to check by first going around the wall.
Therefore…
"Keep using detection magic and follow me. It’s an unknown world. Assume anything could appear."
"Yes. I’ll just memorize the coordinates in case."
"Oh, good."
Leaving behind a forest that looked too peaceful to be the ‘Great Forest’ of the Dark Continent, we headed east.
And how much time had passed?
‘This map is really ridiculously huge.’
The sunset had already completely disappeared beyond the mountain range, and the stars were fully visible in the pitch-black night sky, but we still hadn’t reached the wall.
Or maybe we’re halfway there?
‘…I thought it would take a few hours.’
It was a mishap that happened because the place we were in was a high ground, and the wall was so high.
A mirage, perhaps?
No matter how far I went, I didn’t feel like I was getting any closer.
"Let’s stop here tonight. We’ll stay here overnight and move again tomorrow."
The wall became invisible at night, so I just prepared to camp here.
I decided that if we went in the wrong direction, we would only waste more time.
"…"It’s been a long time since I slept on a blanket."
As I lay down in my sleeping bag and looked up at the starry night sky, the GM spoke first.
Well, did the night make her a bit more sentimental?
I couldn’t tell her detailed emotional changes, but it was definitely the starting point for the small talk I wanted.
"You were an explorer back then, weren’t you?"
"Yes. It’s been more than seven years since then."
"…Why did you stop exploring?"
"Just… things happened. It was also a time when I felt my own limitations…"
The fact that she just brushed it off as ‘things happened’ suggests that she didn’t want to talk about the details.
Or perhaps it was a situation she couldn’t talk about.
‘She locked herself in the magical tower right after giving up exploration and spent seven years there…’
I don’t know her circumstances, but I’m not completely ignorant of her past.
Because I did some research on her.
‘There must be a reason why she became a reclusive hermit…’
My intuition tells me that the reason isn’t her but external factors.
The royal family, or maybe Baekho.
"Still, it’s strangely peaceful lying down like this."
"What kind of emotional change is that? Earlier you were like I was taking you to hell."
"I still hate it. But I like this one thing."
"What is it?"
"No one knows I’m here."
Then I finally understood why she said she felt at peace.
It seemed like the royal family was watching her too.
She once went out of the magical tower for a short while, and Baekho ambushed her.
Or maybe there are more enemies in the city?
‘If that’s the case, I shouldn’t tell her Baekho is out there…’
Carefully avoiding making any unfavorable statements, I continued the light conversation.
“Lover, you say… I’ve met women before, since I’m also getting up there in age, but… none of them ended well.”
I’m just not the type to be good at dating.
“You’re talking about the school I first joined? To be honest… I don’t want to talk about it. I’m sorry.”
She chooses a direct approach when she wants to lie or evade a situation.
Or maybe this incident is just her weakness.
‘I’ll have to look into this in more detail later.’
The school she first joined was disbanded because of an incident, and she then founded her current school.
Sadly, it was difficult to find detailed records about ‘the incident’.
Was it kept completely confidential?
All I know is that the incident was related to forbidden magic.
‘I should ask Uncle Kyle about it later. He should be well-versed in forbidden magic.’
We continued to chat about trivial things until we fell asleep, and through those small conversations, I realized something.
I, Baekho, and this woman are similar in many ways.
They’re not on the side of the players, the royal family, or Noahrk.
***
The next morning dawned.
"Did you sleep well?"
"My whole body is stiff."
"Here, drink some water. You’ll feel better."
"…What does that have to do with being stiff?"
"Don’t worry about the trivial things."
We got up, had a quick meal, and immediately headed towards the wall.
And…
"We’ve finally arrived."
"Arrived, you say? This is just the beginning."
As the sunset came again, we reached near the wall and moved along the outer wall.
Because it was mentioned in the few texts I had.
‘Lafdonia’, located at the edge of the continent, was a domain that relied on trade as its main source of income.
Which means.
There has to be a sea near Lafdonia.
Thump, thump.
A transparent barrier formed along the outer wall that could be felt even by touching it with your hands.
We walked along it all night and arrived at the 10th and 9th districts, which could be considered the east of Lafdonia, before dawn broke.
But…
"It’s too dark to see anything. It’s better to wait until it gets brighter."
"You must be tired, why don’t you get some sleep."
The problem was after we took a nap.
"Baron… Wake up! W-what on earth is…."
"…Let’s just go closer."
We had been mesmerized by the scenery we saw in the distance as soon as we woke up, but we quickly headed towards that location.
And…
"…"
"…"
We both lost our words.
But if we had to try to organize the situation step by step.
‘First.’
The sea existed.
The sea, which we saw from the cliff at the edge of the continent, stretched out widely along the ridge.
The only problem was…
‘Ashen.’
The sea is ashen.
No, not just the sea, but the sky too.
The rippling waves.
The clouds imprinted in the sky.
Everything beyond the gorge, as if photographed in black and white, was devoid of color and frozen in time.
Staring blankly at the sight, the GM murmured.
"…The world has never really been healed."
