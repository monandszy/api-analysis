The Raven's Gambit (1)
“They report that Baron Yandell has been lost…,” a subordinate, who had served at his side for decades, reported, head bowed deeply in shame.
The Marquis did not express anger.  He merely closed his eyes, as if composing himself, and exhaled slowly.  “Is that so…?”
To ask if he wasn't enraged by the failure wouldn't be quite accurate, but all emotions require a clearly defined target for release. For the Marquis, that target was himself.  Simultaneously, it was the world itself. This world orchestrated all events using unseen threads, as if it were the most amusing game imaginable.
‘Does this world wish for his survival…?’
The thunderbolt had struck.  Despite whatever methods he employed, the barbarian had not only thwarted the attack but had saved everyone, leaving himself incapacitated.  The reports suggested he was on the brink of death.  Another shot, they thought, would suffice.  But…
“Tell me, what happened?”
“It's that…,” the subordinate stammered.  The explanation involved an unidentified magic circle activating, after which everyone vanished from sight.
“We are investigating the nature of the magic as swiftly as possible—”
“No need. I already know what it is.”
“…Pardon?”
As the Chancellor of Raphdonia, the Marquis knew this city better than anyone.  This city is a colossal fortress, a structure designed to withstand any attack and respond to all contingencies.  Countless ancient magics permeate this fortress, some of which remain fully functional even in the modern age.
“It's a summoning magic circle of sorts. One that forcibly draws everything within a confined area to a designated location.” Although he only received reports, the Marquis grasped the situation quicker than anyone.
“Then the culprit is Baron Wilkins, commander of the Fifth Legion. He would have been granted authority over the ancient magic in Sector Seven the moment martial law was declared.”  The Marquis continued, summarizing his deductions.
“He wouldn't have been able to counter the first thunderbolt, but afterward, he would have maintained a constant vigil. He knew we were targeting Baron Yandell; he would have tried to prevent the second strike. However, activating the magic circle requires considerable time…”  The Marquis tapped the table with his fingers.
“You mentioned stragglers?”
“Yes.  Dozens of barbarians stationed on the outskirts remained unaffected.”
“Indeed… Perhaps they hastily activated the unprepared circle upon witnessing our retreat…”  A renewed fire ignited in the Marquis’s eyes.
“Then it's not too late.”
“Pardon?”
“This summoning circle was last used during the Iron Wall Incident, for rescue operations. However, even then, its hasty activation prevented proper functionality.”
The records were irrefutable. In devising this plan, the royal family had reviewed every card in its hand hundreds, no, thousands of times.
Knock, knock, knock!
A sharp knock echoed through the room.  After granting permission, a man entered and quickly bowed.  Eltor Terseiron, the former commander of the Third Legion, and the Marquis's son. Despite their clear bloodline, the Marquis immediately cut to the chase upon seeing his son.
“What is it?”
His tone was colder than when addressing his subordinates.  His expression, almost unpleasant, was creased with displeasure. However, it didn't take long for a smile to cross the Marquis's face.
“…Breaking news, Einar has been found causing a disturbance in Sector Four's dimensional plaza!”
Upon hearing his son's report, the Marquis raised the corners of his mouth. If the summoning magic had functioned correctly, everything within the target area would have been transported to the Imperial Capital.  But that wasn't the case.
‘Even during the Iron Wall Incident, the rescue operation caused a great uproar due to the haphazard dispersal of those being rescued.’
Even if Bjorn Yandell had been fortunate enough to be transferred to Raphdonia’s territory, there was currently no solution.  But…
‘It’s too early to give up.’
Wasn't that true of the barbarian?  Unless the possibility was zero, he relentlessly pursued it, ultimately achieving success.  The method to capture such a monster was only one.
“Eltor, inform the entire army. Conduct a thorough search of every sector currently under our control; every drawer, behind every armoire, leave no stone unturned.”
There was nothing else to do but try.
The Cruel Hand of Fate
Had you ever felt the cruel hand of fate? If asked, Rothmiller could nod repeatedly, recounting his experiences: the loss of his parents as a child, meeting a benefactor who taught him survival skills, his lack of talent leaving him to repeatedly lose companions in the Labyrinth, and, despite all this, sharing the early chapters of a man destined to be remembered as a great hero.
Growing up in the Reatras Church orphanage, Rothmiller considered all of this fate: meeting people, learning new things, gaining companions, cherishing what he had, realizing new truths, sacrificing some things to gain more important things, discovering new emotions… a sequence of coincidences he labeled fate.  Yes, perhaps even up to this moment.
“Truly… how cruel,” he murmured, once again feeling fate’s bitter irony.  Wasn't it so?  An ancient magical weapon fell from the sky, and a man who seemed invincible fell, protecting everyone.  Before he could recover, enemy forces poured out from all sides, and he retreated in disarray.
[Behel—RAAAAAAAAAAAAA!]
A barbarian, spear in hand, carried the dying hero, while a fairy bound to a spirit king cleared a path. A halfling, wielding twin swords, darted about, rescuing those in danger, and the mage-in-charge frantically cast spells, searching for a breakthrough.
And then…
[The enemies are retreating!]
Those who had doggedly clung to their encirclement receded like a tide.
[A thunderbolt…!]
The moment it reappeared in the sky, a second time…
SHAAAAAA-!!
A geometric pattern blazed across the ground where they stood, emitting a brilliant light.  His subsequent memories were fragmented.  When he regained consciousness, he was before a statue.
[Teleportation…?]
The temple was a ruin; through shattered windows, he saw Noirk troops patrolling the streets.  And there…
Bjorn Yandell, the man everyone hailed as a hero, lay unconscious on the ground.  He was covered in blood, probably from several high-grade potions, but showed no major external injuries.  He would awaken soon, he hoped.
But then, the situation took a drastic turn, not because Yandell's condition worsened, but because…
[Search everywhere! Strip the walls if you must, the Marquis’s orders!]
If the troops he’d glimpsed through the windows were merely patrolling before, they now searched methodically, with a clear objective. This hideout would soon be discovered.
[…Yandell! Yandell! Yandell! Can you hear me?]
Rothmiller frantically roused Yandell, and thankfully, he awoke from his deep sleep.  But…
[Don't worry. I can still move—]
For some reason, Yandell collapsed, blood gushing from every orifice.  Rothmiller’s mind went blank.  They would soon storm this place. He needed to escape, but how…?  He didn't know.
So, Rothmiller scoured the ruined temple for information. Their current location: the central branch of the Reatras Church in Sector Four.  Following the main road in front of the temple would lead him to the Imperial Capital.  And if he could just get there…
‘I’ll live.’
The problem with this plan was simple: how?  How could he navigate the enemy lines while carrying the enormous, immobile barbarian?
Fortunately, he was used to compromise. Instead of searching for a perfect solution, he chose the best he could manage.
‘I need a horse and a cart.’
Rothmiller headed for the stable attached to the temple branch.  There was a cart for transporting goods, but no horses.  They must have been taken long ago…
[Hee-hee-hing!]
As if by magic, he made eye contact with a horse outside the fence.  Whether the horse remained was irrelevant.  Perhaps it had managed to escape the looting by staying outside the broken fence.  What mattered was he’d found a horse and cart.
“Easy, easy, good boy…”
Rothmiller, having cared for horses at the orphanage as a child, calmly took hold of the reins.  He secured the cart, then…
“Ugh…”
He struggled to lift the heavy barbarian body onto the cart.  He adjusted the protruding legs, filled the gaps with hay, and covered the whole thing with a large cloth, transforming it into a load-carrying cart.  The question remained…
Would this work? Could he really reach his destination safely? If they failed, they would both die.  Shouldn't he just prioritize his own survival?
His worries intensified, fueled by resentment. Why him?  He had plenty of talented companions.  Plenty who would help him without being asked.  Yet, in this moment of desperate need… why was it him, standing beside Yandell?
“This is infuriating.”
He grumbled, shaking Yandell to wake him, then resigning himself to Yandell’s immobility, cursing fate, and feeling ashamed of his own weakness.
“But…”
In the ruined temple, his eyes met those of a broken statue, and he steeled his resolve.
“There's nothing else I can do.”
Life sometimes throws unexpected challenges.  Frightening, yet unavoidable.  So…
“May the twilight stars guide us…”
He rode, the cart trailing behind, through streets swarming with enemies.  Naturally, their speed was slow.  Even a trot would be faster.  And it was hardly stealthy.
Creak, creak.
The cart wheels groaned with each rotation, sending a jolt through his heart.  Thump, thump, thump, thump.  His head pounded, a dizzying sensation, yet he maintained a calm exterior. He wasn't as strong as Yandell's other companions. He couldn't fight his way through hundreds of soldiers.  He couldn’t devise ingenious solutions like a mage.  So…
‘Please…’
He desperately prayed his ruse would work.  That was all he could do.  And did it work?
…
The first Noirk soldier merely glanced at him, not suspecting anything.  Apparently, nonchalantly driving a cart through the streets wasn't particularly suspicious.
“Whew…”
He’d believed it was possible, and it had worked, but he was completely drained.  Yet, he'd only passed one soldier.  Creak, creak, creak—
The journey was as long and arduous as their slow pace.  But it wasn't surprising; his life had always been like this.
Two soldiers, three soldiers…
It took eight years of struggling in the Labyrinth before he could become a 7th-grade explorer.  Four soldiers, five soldiers, six soldiers…
He’d even started later than most.  Most entered the Labyrinth as soon as they came of age, but he was twenty-six when he first stepped inside.
Ten soldiers, twenty soldiers, thirty soldiers…
He ran as hard as he could, making up for lost time. But he always lagged behind, experiencing the agony of being left behind. So, there was no reason to be surprised.  Going slow.  He was already sickeningly used to it.  Perhaps it was what he did best in this world.
“Hey.”
Then, a Noirk soldier, the seventy-first he'd encountered, stopped him.
“Who do you belong to? I want to see what’s in that cart.”
