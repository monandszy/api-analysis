## Chapter 590: Boss Run (3)
Guardian Essence possesses two distinct characteristics. Firstly, it grants a base stat boost of 1.5 times compared to regular entities. Secondly, it allows the holder to utilize all active skills possessed by the regular entity.
However, the Essence held by Herza, the Guardian of one of the five Rifts in the fifth floor, known as the Rift of Light, deviates slightly from this general rule.
“Now, Amelia… once you’re rested, try using it.”
While it’s the norm for a 4th-grade monstrosity like the Cyclops to wield all three of its active skills, Herza’s Essence only contained a single active skill. Surprisingly, this skill wasn’t even one that ordinary Cyclopses possessed.
It’s like this.
“Amelia Rainwells has activated [Wave Connection].”
Upon using the skill, a blurry line connects Amelia and me. A connection line visible only to those who are the skill’s targets.
Its effect is straightforward.
“Amelia Rainwells has activated [Abyssal Power].”
Those connected by the skill can share each other’s skills.
Just like this black aura blooming on my hammer.
“They’ve studied this Essence thoroughly, haven’t they?”
At first glance, it seems like an absurdly overpowered skill, but with research, you understand.
It’s not a truly overpowered skill.
Well, except for a few cases.
Whoosh-!
The black aura enveloping my hammer dissipates into the air.
Amelia has deactivated the skill…
“…The Soul Consumption is intense.”
“How intense?”
“It can barely sustain for a minute, even in peak condition.”
In a way, you could consider it a penalty similar to [Self-Replication].
The MP consumption is outrageous.
“Then shall we try another way to utilize it?”
As I hinted at moving on, Amelia closed her eyes and focused.
[Wave Connection] had a total of three application methods.
The first, as we just witnessed, is to manifest your own skills through a companion.
You could consider it a Support-type.
And the second…
“It’s a pattern bosses use.”
Connecting with an enemy and using it offensively, a Dealer-type.
The Hell Giant we just defeated had a pattern where it connected with me, sacrificing mobility for higher-powered area-of-effect attacks.
Well, since there were no people around and I immediately targeted its eyes whenever it used the connection, I could easily overcome it.
“Anyway, that’s a pass.”
Amelia doesn’t possess self-destruction skills or area-of-effect attacks, so this method is completely irrelevant.
Therefore, the remaining method is the last one.
“Amelia Rainwells has activated [Self-Replication].”
“Amelia Rainwells has activated [Wave Connection].”
A Utility-type, designed to enhance ‘Summoned Entities’.
Essentially, the standard way to use [Wave Connection].
While using it as an offensive skill gives you an advantage by shifting the penalty to the enemy and allowing you to use skills from the enemy’s location…
That’s a usage method suited for monsters with incredibly large MP pools.
[Wave Connection] truly shines when utilized like this.
“It really… became the same Soul Consumption. What kind of sorcery is this?”
Well, being a gamer, I naturally don’t understand the principle.
If it were a magician, they would have spouted a bunch of nonsensical hypotheses about the synchronization of mental waves or similar frequencies.
I only understand the results after countless experiments.
The fact that MP consumption doesn’t increase when using [Wave Connection] on ‘Summoned Entities’.
Oh, as a side note, it naturally applies to clones as well.
“With this… we can engage in more diverse battles.”
Amelia, with her combat expertise, seemed to instantly grasp the value of this newly acquired ability…
“Speaking of Embodied Abilities… the thing you call Passive Skills in your world… I haven’t heard anything about it…”
“Ah, do you not know about Cyclopses?”
“They’re not common entities… You’re the strange one for knowing the characteristics of every entity.”
Amelia, embarrassed by her lack of knowledge, tries to paint me as the odd one out.
“Come here. You’ll understand. What Embodied Abilities are.”
I chuckled, pulling out the item I managed to find after a lot of effort before coming here.
At the same time, Amelia’s eyes showed a hint of confusion.
“This is…”
A monocle.
A ‘Gungye’ monocle, as they say.
***
“[One-Eyed] is activated.”
“Character’s Dynamic Vision increased by +200.”
“You can see what you cannot see.”
***
After the duo raid with Amelia ended.
I continued to change members and challenge Rifts. While tanks can fulfill their role in any situation, dealers cannot.
The essence of [Dungeon and Stone] is ‘Matchups’.
If the matchup is unfavorable, there are enemies you absolutely can’t defeat. Conversely, if the matchup is favorable, it can make conquering easier.
And…
“It’s a waste to just let this talent pool go to waste.”
The exploration party, composed of the elite of the Royal Family, contained all the talent I needed.
When I needed a priest, a grandmaster-level priest joined, following my orders. When I said I needed a 2nd-grade fire mage, there was always a mage who could do it.
“I see why there’s no limit on the number of people.”
A dungeon designed for single-player and two-player Rift clearing.
However, it doesn’t seem like it was designed for only two people. It must have been designed for hundreds of people to enter, dividing themselves strategically, and methodically conquering it.
“Still, it’s a shame. I defeated so many fifth-floor Guardians, and so many Essences are being wasted.”
I could carry Essences in test tubes when entering with mages, but otherwise, I had to discard them all.
“Even the cheapest one would fetch hundreds of millions of Stones at auction…”
Of course, the most regrettable was Ainar.
Even if it wasn’t a graduation Essence, there was an Essence that was great for spear-wielders among the fifth-floor Guardians.
Unfortunately, she wasn’t easy enough for me to carry her solo, so I had to give up on taking her.
Well, at least I managed to give Amelia a valuable Essence due to this exploration.
“A clone rogue doesn’t need a graduation Essence, so I guess it’s okay to skip the substitute Essence…”
It’s truly unbelievable, the first floor.
It’s completely different from any other part of the dungeon, isn’t it?
There are so many things I saw for the first time here, and it’s hard to even gauge how much profit I made.
“….”
What in the world is this place?
After meeting the vampire dude, this thought fills my head whenever I’m alone.
The silver sea, the monsoon, the dimensional collapse, the village chief, Hamsik…
I replay these memories to not forget them, and I replay them again to ensure I’m not missing anything.
‘Sigh, what’s the point of thinking about it anyway.’
As always, I ended my thoughts, feeling suffocated.
And to clear my mind, I got up from my seat after ending my rest.
“Even if you ask like that, I can’t go to the fourth floor. It’s too dangerous.”
I saw an adventurer pleading with Raven in front of the statue of Kalpion, the Guardian of the fourth floor.
“The name…,”
What was it again?
Everyone just calls him ‘Big Hammer’, so I have no idea.
Anyway, he was a renowned 3rd-grade adventurer, even in the city.
“Could you reconsider? It’s an Essence I desperately need.”
He doesn’t look like someone whose objective is experience or someone who’s obsessed with time attack.
However, it must be that he truly needs this Essence.
“No, even if you say it like that…,”
“With all due respect, the Mage of Gold doesn’t seem to know much about my skills.”
“Are you saying my judgment was wrong?”
“Haha, not exactly. I just… wanted you to test me. If I’m worthy or not.”
Even though Raven spoke seriously, the man still didn’t budge. Raven let out a sigh, looking troubled.
Therefore, I, who was watching, stepped in.
After all, I was the one who assigned this troublesome task.
“If you want to be tested, I’ll help you.”
“Baron Yandell…?”
The man looked startled for a moment as I joined the conversation, but then nodded as if he was happy I did.
“Then I’ll gladly accept your help.”
The moment he finished his sentence, he raised ‘Big Hammer’ with a fierce gaze.
“He didn’t even explain how he wants to be tested.”
It’s not really a surprise.
How long have adventurers been like this?
I also prefer this kind of personality.
“Uhm… Baron Yandell? There’s no need to waste your strength for me…”
What is this girl saying now?
“This isn’t wasting strength.”
“…Eh?”
“It’s about reducing time waste.”
I immediately activated [Gigantification] and looked down at him.
And…
“Small.”
The moment I uttered that single word, the sparring began.
However, as someone who earned the nickname ‘Big Hammer’, his body was quite tough. Therefore, the sparring became quite a prolonged fight.
Did it take about 15 minutes?
“I lose…,”
While he couldn’t inflict any damage on me, he eventually accepted defeat as I kept knocking him down with my hammer every time I landed a hit on his jaw.
“It seems I was too greedy. I’ll give up on the fourth floor.”
It was a clean attitude, contrasting sharply with the way he was clinging to Raven.
It might seem strange, but macho types are usually the ones who accept the law of strength without complaint.
“Wooooooah!”
“Victory for the Baron!”
The spectators gathered around cheered for the end of the match, but I didn’t feel any elation or anything.
“I’m definitely lacking in damage these days.”
A tank’s misery, something I’ve been feeling frequently lately.
I’ve become several times stronger than before thanks to the Bellarios Essence and Aegis Barrier, but my damage remains the same—
“Baron Yandell, can we talk?”
“Huhuhu, if you’re thanking me, it’s alright—,”
“Oh, because I made you waste 15 minutes on something that would have taken 5 minutes if we just talked?”
“Uhm…,”
My mind goes blank for a moment.
Raven smirked, as if it was just a joke.
“Alright, come with me. I had something to tell you anyway.”
We walked a few steps, and Raven activated a sound-muting magic, while I also made my expression serious.
“Is it a secret?”
“Huh? No, not really… I don’t know. Baron Yandell should decide.”
I leaned down, adjusting my height to her small stature, and prepared to listen carefully. Raven slowly opened her mouth.
“You know, as I’m in a role similar to an examiner, I have many opportunities to hear what happens inside. As I was listening, I found out…,”
Just get to the point.
Before I could even say that, Raven summarized the core information herself.
“Duke Camformier doesn’t talk anymore.”
“He doesn’t talk?”
Wasn’t that always the case?
That thought was about to escape my mouth, but then—
“No, really, literally doesn’t talk anymore. He doesn’t even say things like his killing intent is rising.”
“Ah…,”
“He just goes berserk the moment he enters now… It’s strange no matter how I think about it. He did at least ‘speak’ after you left, right?”
Deep in thought, my hand unconsciously reaches my chin.
“Indeed…,”
It’s suspicious.
It was a little strange that the dude, who was perfectly fine, suddenly started going crazy.
He wasn’t in his right mind for three hours, after all.
“There are no changes without a cause in this world.”
Raven, sounding like a mage, looked up at me.
“Then why did the Duke suddenly change? What on earth could it be?”
As a barbarian, I’m incapable of finding the answer no matter how much I wrack my brain.
But it’s different from a gamer’s perspective.
In fact, there was one hypothesis that popped into my head the moment I heard this.
“In truth, it’s been going berserk since earlier.”
If that dude talking to us in a normal state was considered ‘an error’ in the dungeon…
‘Hotfix…’
The error might have been patched in real-time.
By whoever controls the dungeon.
***
27 types of Rift Guardians existing from the first to the fifth floors.
And 14 unidentified Guardians categorized with Duke Camformier.
A total of 41 types.
Boss running, which initially felt daunting, is nearing its end thanks to our methodical conquering.
“One more left…,”
The only remaining statue is the statue of the fifth-floor Rift.
As a side note, the Rift where this guy appears is a ‘Unique Rift’ that opens with an incredibly low probability, and it’s not a good matchup for me.
That’s why I pushed it to the very end.
“Haah…,”
Dozens of lights are already lit.
Looking at the still unmoving stone gate, I let out a sigh.
“I guess I need to clear all of them to make something happen…,”
Meaning, I have no choice but to defeat that guy as well.
“But it’s a two-player entry, so I guess it’s still doable…,”
I even considered skipping this run, but there was no alternative.
Tanks are essential for boss battles, but there was no one to fill my spot.
Well, there might be someone if I look around…
“But they’re not reliable.”
It’s better if I enter.
Therefore, I need to decide who to bring from here.
“Erwen again?”
It’s a safe choice.
She’s practically a cheat code.
Erwen has been my partner hunting Guardians the most, next to Raven.
I went in with mages when the Rift was easy, because you can extract Essences. For difficult Rifts, I brought Erwen with me except for a few situations…
“…No.”
I shook my head.
The target of this run isn’t someone who can be defeated solely with force.
Then, what about Amelia?
“She’s not bad either…,”
Ainar seems better than Amelia.
Her fighting spirit has dropped, making her presence less noticeable, but her unique luck can’t be denied.
However…
Tap.
There’s a better option if you’re relying on luck.
And it’s right in front of me.
“Get ready. We’re entering the Rift.”
The moment my announcement was made, he looked at me, his face filled with confusion.
“Yes? Me? Why, why…?”
It’s Sven Parav, a paladin of the Reatlass Church.
