## Chapter 697: The Truth, a Bitter Pill
"Ha-ha... You're still the same. I appreciate your concern, but there's no need for it. Just as an ant's worry doesn't change anything for a human, your anxieties won't alter the course of events."
Auril Gaviss chuckled, his words laced with a playful, yet cutting, edge. The GM, unable to control his expression, managed a strained smile, revealing a defeat that echoed through the entire exchange.
"Well then, it seems we've reached the end of our meeting for today."
"I… Elder? There's something I wanted to ask…"
"It's getting late. Perhaps we can discuss that question another time."
"Does that mean we'll meet again?"
"Of course. You're a model student. I've been watching you closely."
"R-really?"
Reassured by the prospect of another meeting, the GM's worry seemed to lessen. Auril Gaviss, noticing this, offered a warm smile and led us deeper into the cave.  
"Wow..."
"How many are there?"
Upon arriving at a spacious cavern, everyone gasped in awe. It was no wonder. Countless dimensional monuments stood along the cavern walls, arranged in an orderly fashion, enough to fill a soccer field.  
"You… well, this one is perfect."
Auril Gaviss pointed towards the dimensional monument we were to use.
"I… would it be possible to know where this leads?"
"Hmm, I'd rather leave it as a surprise, but you seem so anxious.  This will take you back to the place you first arrived."
"The place we arrived... you mean where the magic circle was broken?"
"Indeed."
The GM's face relaxed, seemingly relieved to know our destination. But something felt amiss.  ‘It's odd how he always answers his questions so readily.'
Perhaps the GM had planned this all along.  It seemed like an unnecessary ploy to me.  No matter how much he laughed and joked in front of us, this shadowy elder would always be ready to spit venom from behind his smile.
Swoosh!
As the portal opened, Auril Gaviss gave us a look that urged us to depart.  In response, Baekho spat on the ground. Then, as if he couldn't stand to remain in the same space any longer, he stepped into the portal, leading the way.
"I'll go next.  It's better to be safe than sorry, in case Baekho gets into any trouble."
Following Baekho, the second to enter was the 'Doom Elder,' followed by Aures.  Then Jeina and the GM passed through the portal, leaving only Auril Gaviss and me.
'No more pretending is necessary.'
As I paused before the portal, Auril Gaviss fixed his gaze on me.
"Why? Don't you want to go quickly?"
"Tsk, of course not. When have I ever given you the impression I was being impatient? I was just observing you, since it seemed you had something to say."
"..."
"That's not like you.  If you have something to say, speak up."
He said that, yet he wouldn't answer the questions I truly wanted to know.  I glanced around, taking a cue from the GM, and spoke with a semblance of politeness.
"Elder, I have just one question."
"You always seem to have questions for me."
"Because you have so many secrets."
"Ha-ha... Ask away, what do you wish to know?"
"What exactly is this place?"
Auril Gaviss looked slightly taken aback by my question.
"Why are you so curious about that? There are other important questions you could ask."
"I've already asked those important questions several times, but I never got a proper answer."
I grumbled, voicing my frustration at my fruitless inquiries. Then, Auril Gaviss burst into laughter.
"..."What? Ha-ha-ha! A-ha-ha-ha!"
This crazy old man! What was so funny about this situation? It was utterly baffling, but the fact that he was in a good mood was a positive sign.
"Ha-ha… Sorry, a memory came to mind."
"A memory?"
"Anyway, I've been remiss towards you lately, so I will answer your question."
"Oh, is that so? Then I am extremely grateful."
"Don't mock me."
"Yes…."
Since he was in a rare mood to answer my question, I decided not to press him further and simply waited patiently.  After all, my current question seemed quite crucial.
[This is somewhere outside the Wall.]  Somewhere outside the Wall.  [A place of great significance to me.] Auril Gaviss's place of great significance.
It even bore a striking resemblance to the Crystal Cave on the first floor. What exactly could this place be?
"Shall we walk a bit?"
As Auril Gaviss invited me for a stroll, my curiosity grew. I readily nodded, following his lead.
As we walked, Auril Gaviss suddenly asked a cryptic question.
"A lie you wish to believe as truth, and a truth you wish to believe as a lie."
"Yes... ?"
"If you had to choose one, which would you choose?"
While it seemed like a strange question to ask out of the blue, I knew this old man wouldn't be asking something meaningless. I carefully considered my answer.
I remembered seeing a similar topic on the internet back in the day. A curry that tastes like poop.  Poop that tastes like curry.
Of course, there were obvious differences between those topics and the riddle Auril Gaviss had posed. But, ironically, that made the choice easier.
"I choose the latter."
"You prefer a truth you wish to believe as a lie?"
"Because it's still the truth."
"Hmm, I see..."
Auril Gaviss merely gave an ambiguous response to my answer, not saying anything further.  Despite my earnest reply.
"We've arrived."
Auril Gaviss stopped before a stone door blocking the cave passage. The door was imbued with magical energy; as soon as he placed his hand on it, the door automatically swung open.
And…
"..."
A completely unexpected space unfolded before my eyes.  It resembled space, a vast, empty expanse with a set of stairs stretching upwards, straight ahead.
"Be careful and don't fall."
As usual, the old man ascended the stairs without a word, and I followed silently, my gaze fixed on the surroundings.
The stairs seemed endless.  As I continued my ascent, I realized something.
He brought me here to show me what was at the top of those stairs, atop the altar.
"What is that...?"
"You'll know when you see it."
I had no idea what he was talking about, but I understood as soon as I reached the top of the stairs.  I saw it, the thing floating on the altar, enclosed in a thin membrane.
"Shards of the Memory Stone..."
Hundreds of them, not one, were swirling in the air, like a miniature galaxy.
"Did you collect all of these yourself?"
Auril Gaviss nodded indifferently in response to my question.  He extended his hand toward the air, and one of the Memory Shards, floating slowly in a circular motion like a part of the Milky Way, began to move towards us.
"Would you like to read it?"
I nodded and, without hesitation, began to read the ancient script inscribed on the Shard. The only problem was…
"Evil Spirit from Another Realm... How do I read this?"
There was something I couldn't decipher.
"That's not just ancient script, it's a pattern."
"You don't need to translate it.  Think of it like a name, if you were a human."
Well, that's something I can leave for later. It didn't take me long to read the rest of the Shard's contents.  It was incredibly short.
"The Evil Spirit '————' from Another Realm, after losing three comrades, finally realized the path they were meant to follow..."
…What?  Wait a minute.
"Is this '————' me...?"
I frantically looked at Auril Gaviss, but he only smiled softly, not giving me an answer.
"..."
Damn it.
The Memory Shards.  Fragments of the 'Memory Stone,' a record of all time, from the past to the present, and even the future.
I know the power of these 'records' better than anyone.  I have experienced it firsthand.  Thump!
It was the past I visited through a Memory Shard, all those years ago.
Ever since then, I've been running around trying to change the future where one person died, but I ultimately failed.  The stories recorded in the Memory Stone are inevitably fulfilled.
Of course, there were tricks like Amelia's 'deceit.'  But...
'That won't work this time.'
How could it? I'm not an innocent ten-year-old anymore.  
Pretending to be dead to fool my comrades is also impossible.  And I don't even know when this will happen. Thump!
Three... 'Three comrades...'
In [Dungeon and Stone], comrades dying is commonplace.  But why does this small number feel so monumental, so desperate? Thump!
Even as my heart clenched, my mind remained cool and calculated. Who are these three? Or rather, who would I *want* them to be?
As thoughts, thoughts I should never have as a leader, raced through my mind...
"It's truly a painful thing to know the end."
Auril Gaviss, who had given me the biggest dilemma of my life, nodded, seeming to understand me.  For a moment, my blood ran cold.
"...What?"
I wanted to punch that decrepit face right then and there.  But...
"..."
I had to endure it.  Punching him now would only bring me harm.  So...
"When..."
I gritted my teeth, my body trembling, and asked him.
"When do you know...  when will these events recorded here take place...?"
"I don't know.  If the Memory Stone were whole, perhaps. But with just these fragments, the timing is impossible to speculate."
'So, you're telling me you can't help me at all?'  The moment the thought crossed my mind, a thread in my brain snapped. Auril Gaviss continued, 
"However, based on how the Memory Stone records events, it seems clear that this too is a singular event."
In simpler terms, it means that three people won't die one after the other over a long period, but rather during a single ‘event.’
I gritted my teeth and asked him,
"...Do you know who these three are?"
I agonized over asking this question for an eternity. But as if he knew my struggles, this old man answered promptly and plainly,
"I don't know."
No excuses, no explanations, simply a 'don't know.'  But for some reason, I was both angry and relieved at that answer. If he had revealed their names, I truly would have gone mad.
"You seem troubled.  Are your comrades so important to you?"
"...Don't prod me.  I'm at my limit right now."
"Then so be it."
My words, spoken with superhuman patience, were met with silence from Auril Gaviss.  A silence that stretched on, heavy and tense. Thump!
Even though quite some time had passed, my heart still pounded, and the tension in my toes wouldn't subside.  But...
'Information.'  A sliver of my sanity returned.
"Elder."
"It seems you've regained a little of your mind."
After all, what was done was done.  It wasn't like I could change the 'recorded' future.
"Why did you show me this?"
I knew I had to find out.  This old man, who specialized in playing with people, wouldn't have shown me this without a sinister reason.
"A reason?  Honestly, it was more a whim.  If you had left then, without asking about this place, I wouldn't have shown you."
"..."
"And you look unconvinced."
Of course I wouldn't believe him.  Even if I had initiated the conversation, I knew he had a hidden motive for showing me this. But...
"You're clearly the former."
"..."
"You said you preferred the latter, but that's just because you want to be that kind of person. You're the former."
At first, I had no idea what he was getting at. But soon, I understood.  It was an extension of the riddle we had discussed earlier.  A lie you wish to believe as truth.  And a truth you wish to believe as a lie.
"You wish my statement about 'whim' was a lie, but it's the truth, nonetheless."
It sounded like a flimsy excuse to deflect the issue, but I couldn't find a sharp retort.  But as I searched for a way to challenge his point...
"Of course, I'm not disappointed in you. If I asked a hundred people this question, they would all choose 'truth,' but in a real situation, things would be reversed..."
"..."
"Wouldn't you agree, Bjorn Yandel... or rather, Han-Soo Lee?"
Damn it, he leaves me speechless.  I might as well give up trying to reason with this old man.
"...I understand.  It's my fault for starting this by asking questions in the first place. It's not like I had some ulterior motive?"
I spoke with a resigned tone.  Auril Gaviss looked up at the galaxy of Memory Shards floating above, his eyes tinged with a sense of loneliness.
"I don't know what you think of me, but I'm not some monster.  And like Baekho said, I'm not omnipotent either..."
"..."
"I'm just an ordinary human, struggling and agonizing, trying to do one thing.  Just like you."
Well, I don't know.  Sorry, but even in this serious situation, this old man just looks like a crazy old man to me.  No need to ruin the mood by pointing that out. 
"...While I'm here, can I see something else?"
"Your comrades are waiting outside, are you sure you're fine with that?"
"...Comrades?  Hah."
They're just ‘companions,’ nothing more.
"It's fine, you don't need to worry."
