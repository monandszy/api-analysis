##  The Fallen Warrior (Excerpt)
“Gone…,” I muttered, the tension that had held me taut for what felt like an eternity finally snapping.  My companions, their faces etched with worry, converged.
“Are you alright, sir…?,” one asked, her voice laced with concern.
“You look… extremely exhausted, sir,” another chimed in.
Their worried faces surrounded me, framing my form as I lay sprawled upon the ground.
“Bjorn Jandel.”
Amelia stood amongst them, her brow furrowed with a hint of anger. “How did you end up here? Why didn’t you come back? And why were you fighting those… creatures?”
Well, I suppose she had a right to be curious. I had disappeared for months, leaving no trace of my whereabouts. 
“That’s—,” I began, mustering every ounce of strength to rise. 
“I have many questions, but you seem drained.” Amelia chuckled, gently pushing me back onto the ground. “Rest first. We can talk later.”
With her words, a wave of exhaustion washed over me. My eyelids fluttered shut, sleep beckoning me into its embrace.  Despite the fatigue, my mind was a whirlwind.
My heart pounded as I recalled the desperate escape from the encroaching threat beyond the wall. The victory, the gains we had made against Ibaiho, felt fleeting now.  ‘I’ve encountered him again…’, a chilling thought echoed in my mind.  Can I really call this a positive outcome?
Months after we had expected to see them, we had been reunited beyond the wall.  [The evil spirit from another world, ‘————’, having lost three companions, finally awakened to the path he must follow.]
Could this really be a mere coincidence?
The weight of our journey hung heavy in the air.  Four figures, their faces grim, their steps heavy with exhaustion, made their way through the dense forest.
“This is a pain in the ass,” a man with platinum blonde hair muttered, halting his stride. His voice was barely audible, yet the three others remained silent, their eyes betraying their shared frustration. They understood the depth of his anger, the bruised pride that fueled his words.
“Baiho…,” a towering man began, seemingly compelled to break the silence. “Perhaps this question is pointless now, but… why didn’t you press your advantage…?”
“Why didn’t I press my advantage?” Baiho retorted in a cold, clipped tone.
Aures, flustered at his blunt response, nevertheless continued.  “The Jandel Baron, sir.  The whole world knows he cherishes his companions. He would have backed down if you’d pushed him to the limit.”
It was a valid question. Baiho and the Jandel Baron were stark opposites. Bjorn Jandel held his companions in the highest regard.  Baiho… well, Baiho didn’t.
He was a cold-blooded brute.  That was Aures’s assessment, and it was accurate.
Given their stark differences, Baiho seemed to hold the upper hand in their earlier ‘showdown’. So why did the outcome turn out so different?
The answer came from Jeina, who broke the silence. “You probably didn’t see his eyes.”
“Didn’t see his eyes? What are you talking about?”
“His eyes,” Jeina repeated. “If you’d seen his eyes, Aures, you wouldn’t ask that question.”
Aures was confused, tilting his head. Jeina explained further. “If you’d seen them, you would have understood. Baron Jandel is unyielding.  Especially when faced with threats.”
Aures still seemed unconvinced.  The Doom Scholar chimed in. “There are many in this world who act with reckless abandon, driven by shortsightedness or poor judgment.  But Baron Jandel was different.”
“Different how?”
The Doom Scholar ignited a small flame in his palm. “Most people wouldn’t touch fire, knowing how hot it burns. But what about someone seeing fire for the first time?”
“Well, I don’t know… I might have touched it out of curiosity,” Aures offered.
“That’s the nature of ignorance.  Some are afraid because of their lack of knowledge, while others find courage in it.”
“So, what’s your point, old man?”
The Doom Scholar continued.  “Baron Jandel knew how hot the fire was, he knew what would happen if he touched it. But he didn’t back down.”
“He believed it was something he had to do,” Baiho interjected.
The Doom Scholar, unfazed by the interruption, continued with a seemingly irrelevant statement. “They don’t lack fear. They simply learned how to overcome it and move forward.  And people call them ‘warriors.’”
“What?”
“It’s something Febrosk wrote in his autobiography.”
“I see…,” Aures muttered, understanding slowly dawning on him. “Now I know why the barbarians call Baron Jandel a great warrior.”
“Indeed. Seeing it today, I understand why,” the Doom Scholar confirmed.
“So, what about you, old man? Whose side are you on?”
“Right now, I’m on yours. That’s why I’m offering advice, to help you understand why you failed.  Baron Jandel’s eyes showed someone who’d made their decision. You, however, weren’t ready for that kind of commitment.”
“So, what am I supposed to do? Fight him to the death? Just to satisfy my curiosity?”
“This is just a warning for the future. That ‘leash’ you think you have on him? It won’t work anymore.”
“I know, I know. Stop saying it. It’s like you’re rubbing salt on a wound.”
Baiho seemed to have calmed down somewhat, regaining his usual demeanor.  He sighed dramatically, his tone laced with resignation. “This is a real problem. If intimidation through companions doesn’t work, what else can I use to control him?” 
He seemed lost in thought, the frustration of his previous encounter replaced by a new kind of apprehension.  The other three, after a brief exchange of glances, resumed their conversation.
“He is a formidable opponent, indeed,” Aures remarked.
“The Baron?”
“Yes.  To imagine, even after we attacked with everything we had, he lasted for hours… Never in my wildest dreams did I think there could be a monster like that.”
“You simply don’t know. There are always more monsters than you realize,” the Doom Scholar replied, a hint of amusement in his voice.
Aures pondered, seemingly recalling others, his fingers tapping rhythmically on his thigh.  One, two, three, four, five, six… The pace slowed, and his fingers stopped.  But even so…
“Maybe we’ll run out of fingers to count them all soon enough,” the Doom Scholar said, his eyes twinkling.
“What does that mean?”
“Baron Jandel will become even stronger.”
Jeina and Aures said nothing, but their eyes held a single question. Was it truly possible to become stronger than that, even now?  The Doom Scholar turned his gaze to Baiho. 
“Those who have nothing to lose, become cruel. But those who have much to protect… they grow stronger.”
It was a truth he had learned over his long life. 
***
I awoke to the sight of a towering tree, its branches reaching towards the heavens.  Through the leafy canopy, I saw the night sky, a canvas of stars strewn across the Milky Way.
‘It’s chilly.’  I felt a chill emanating from the bare ground, a dampness clinging to the undergrowth.  ‘Did they put this on me?’  A blanket lay draped over my body. A special, oversized blanket meant to cover my entire barbarian frame.  ‘They must have put it on me while I slept, but didn’t want to wake me.’
I felt a wave of warmth wash over me.  If Baiho’s crew had been here, even after years of fighting together, I wouldn’t have felt this kind of compassion.
“Awake,” a voice whispered beside me, a faint smile gracing the speaker’s lips.
I raised my upper body,  my eyes landing on Amelia, sitting by the crackling bonfire. 
“How long have I been out?”
“Two days since you fell into that deep sleep,” she replied.
“Two days…?” I muttered, feeling a twinge of discomfort in my shoulder. ‘No wonder it’s so stiff…’
“What about the others?”
“They’re asleep. I was on watch.”
I tilted my head, puzzled. “You’re not using a clone?” 
Amelia often used a [Self-Replication] clone to stand guard while she slept. But why was she here, using her real body?
“I thought I’d rather have someone with me when you woke up.”
‘Damn, I’m lucky to have her as a comrade.’
“The Magitech expert told me the basic story. You went off on another wild adventure and caused trouble again.”
“Trouble?”
“If you hadn’t gone alone with the Magitech expert, this wouldn’t have happened. What were you thinking?”
Amelia began to scold me, her tone like that of a mother chastising a mischievous child. “Did it even cross your mind to consult us? What were we supposed to do if you died out there? Why are you so reckless?”
I had no words. Not that I had intended for this to happen, but I had put them through hell along with myself.
“Bjorn, son of Jandel. I entrusted my life to you.”
“I’m sorry,” I muttered.
“Don’t make me regret my choice.”
“I’ll be careful next time. I promise,” I said, adopting the most pitiful expression I could muster.
Amelia sighed and rested her forehead on her hand, then, in a gentler tone, said,  “That’s enough of the scolding.” 
“You must have many questions, so let me tell you what happened on our end.”
She then proceeded to give a concise summary of events in the city since I disappeared.
It was quite a lot of information, given that it spanned several months.
The main event was the 13th Month Festival, which included a kind of clan competition.
We were supposed to compete as Anabada, but we couldn’t participate due to my absence.
“The royal family opened the Golden Marriage Vault for the top 10 members of the winning clan…?”
“And for the leader, they opened the Golden Wedding Vault, a level higher than that.”
‘Damn. The Golden Wedding Vault is where they keep Level 2 Essence and Double Numbers, right?’.  I felt a twinge of envy but tried to focus on the positive.
I’d found some amazing things on my own adventure outside the wall, and even ended up getting a big payout from Baiho. 
According to Amelia, nothing major had happened since then.
My absence had caused some problems, but my business in the city seemed to be running smoothly. 
“No one knows about my disappearance?”
This part was truly baffling.
“How is that even possible?”
“We managed to take care of most of your work.”
“But surely some people had questions.”
“We told them you’d found a new Essence and were secluded, doing research.”
“Still, those who knew you’re gone probably figured it out.”
“They probably did. It’s a city, after all. We just flat-out denied it, so they couldn’t say anything.  But they definitely suspect something, especially since we all disappeared at the same time.”
“Right! So, how did you guys get out? Did they fix the magic circle?”
I asked, filled with hope that I could finally return home. But Amelia shook her head and explained.
‘So, they just blocked the way back? They could still come and go as they please from the city?’ 
My heart warmed.  Unlike me, they didn’t know how to return, but they still came out here, into the unknown, to find me.
“Why are you looking at me like that?”
“I’m just… grateful,” I said.
“So, what happened to you?” Amelia asked, her voice a little awkward as she changed the subject.
“As I said, the Magitech expert told me the basics. I want to know the real reason you clashed with Baiho.”
‘That’s a complicated story…’, I thought.
“You met Auril Gavise. And you were the last to leave. I know all that,” she said.
“But I know more,” Amelia continued, her expression serious.  “What happened? Why did you keep it a secret from Baiho? Why did you fight him, even in such a disadvantageous situation?”
I couldn’t help but chuckle at her earnest expression.  “You’re mistaken. I kept it a secret for a different reason.”
Honestly, I had no reason to keep it from Baiho.  If he’d been polite and offered a proper payment for the information, I might have shared it with him. But…
“He was demanding.  I knew I couldn’t let him dictate my fate. I had to hold my ground.”
“I see,” Amelia replied, her understanding clear.
Even so, her curiosity remained.
“So, what exactly happened with him?”
