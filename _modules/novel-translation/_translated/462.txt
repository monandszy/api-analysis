## The Proof (2) 
The heat of battle still clung to my skin, a reminder of the fierce clash.  A chilling air now enveloped me, accompanied by hostile gazes.  “I didn't expect them to be this blatant,” I thought, taking in the atmosphere, thick with tension. A fight could erupt at any moment, yet I remained calm, meticulously assessing the situation. It wasn't the worst-case scenario just yet. Their threats implied a desire, a bargaining chip. “If they truly wanted to finish me off, they would have ambushed me while pretending to leave,” I reasoned.  
So, what was their bluff about?  I needed to figure that out first.  Though I had a hunch, it wasn't confirmed. “Pillaging, huh?” I laughed, the sound echoing with a touch of sarcasm. “Let's start with this. What evidence do you have to claim I pillaged? When I encountered Riakis, it was undeniably alone, wasn't it? Erwen?”
“Yes, yes! Absolutely. Within a 1km radius, I didn’t sense the presence of any other adventurers. And the precedent overwhelmingly favors my claim. In these situations, you cannot claim possession.”
Erwen readily corroborated my story, providing supporting evidence. However, this wouldn’t be the end of it. 
“That precedent applies to regular beasts. You cannot apply the same rule to a Layer Lord.”
“So, what's your point?”
“My clan’s separation from Riakis was an unavoidable consequence during the raid, but it was never meant to relinquish our claim.”
Unavoidable consequence, you say?  Looking at their equipment painted a clear picture.  After all, how could their gear be intact after completing Phase 3?  “They must have switched to new gear from their dimensional pocket. They wanted to buy time.” 
The lure was likely the bait team I saw earlier.  They had deviated from their main force, regrouping and preparing to circle back, their original objective. However, they failed. Their absence was undeniable. The dozens of clan members surrounding us didn’t include a single member of the bait team.  “They discovered the bait team perished and scoured the area. Finally, finding us, they hastily rushed over, leading to this standoff,” I deduced, piecing together the likely events.  
Well, I wasn’t sure about the details, but it was probably close.  
“Lord Yandell stole the Layer Lord, whom our clan was raiding. We suffered heavy casualties, and still he seized the Essence.”
“We had no idea about your situation.”
“But you ignored our pleas and took the Essence nonetheless.”
“Why is that a problem? I killed the beast, and I’ll claim the spoils.”
“But you could never have taken it without our raid, which was nearing completion.”
That was a point I couldn't dispute. It was clear, based on the circumstances, that they had summoned the beast without permission.  In any case, they failed to hold the beast, and I stepped in to prevent further damage to the low-level adventurers.  I didn’t need to say any of that.  
“So, what do you want?” I cut to the chase.  No matter how much logic we presented, it wouldn’t lead to acceptance.  Ultimately, logic didn’t matter. 
“I implore you, on the name of the glorious Lapdonia Royal Family, to make a promise right here.”
In the Labyrinth, in the city, or in any world, regardless of time. 
“Acknowledge your mistake and compensate us with an amount equivalent to the Layer Essence once you return to the city.”
Logic was always a weapon of the powerful.
“Yes.  If you promise that, we can agree that it was never ‘pillaging.’”
In other words, if he didn’t promise, they would label him a ‘pillager’ and engage in a PK.  Getting to the point simplified things. Now, I had three choices.
1. Accept the promise and pay compensation.  It would mean losing all my possessions and being burdened with debt for years. However, I had already consumed the Essence, so the loss wasn't substantial. 
2. Accept the promise and break it later.  Relic crystals were recording this very moment.  Breaking the promise would mean a loss of my noble title for defaming the Royal Family.
Well, did that leave me with only one choice?
3. Prove that my argument was correct.
Having made my decision, I had no reason to hesitate.
“Now, what will it be?”
It was simple.
“After much consideration,” I said, resting my hammer on my shoulder. 
“I have no memory of any such mistake.”
“So you choose the poisoned chalice.”
“If it’s liquor, then it’s liquor. It’s not like it will be sweet anyway.”
“Lord Yandell, you seem to think we can't handle this.”
Well, I didn’t think that. Clan wars were a part of this game, after all.
“Ainarr, Emily, Erwen!” I called out my allies' names.  I noticed I had omitted the Navigator, Aouyen, but didn’t correct myself.  He'd figure it out.  He wasn’t of much help in this situation anyway.
“Prepare for battle!”
As soon as the order was given, my team moved flawlessly. They formed a formation where each of them had the other's backs. Aouyen, realizing the situation through Amelia's cues, moved swiftly behind me.  In conclusion……. 
“Kill anyone who comes at you.” I locked eyes with the Dagger-wielder.  “I will take responsibility for everything.”
Now, it was all up to him. 
*** 
The tension hung in the air, palpable as we stood, weapons pointed at each other.  A chilling silence, lasting for a long time.
“...”
“...”
Alright, he needed to decide already.  Just how long was he going to keep this up?  My impatience grew, but I held back from any rash actions.  A fight wasn’t ideal.  Our individual skills were superior, but the overwhelming numerical advantage gave them a real chance to hurt us.
Still, I chose to push forward.  It was a simple reason.  “He’s taking a huge risk, too.” If a Layer Artifact had dropped, the rewards would have been substantial. However, that wasn’t the case. 
There was nothing for them to gain from a fight. Killing us wouldn't get them the Essence.  All they could get was our equipment. Even if they managed to escape with us, they’d face the charge of attempted murder against a noble once they returned to the city. 
“And it would be infuriating for them to simply let us go.”
That was the root of this cowardly stalemate, this game of chicken.  We were hurtling toward the cliff, and whoever stopped first would lose. However, if neither of us stopped, we’d all fall. 
“Half…,” the Dagger-wielder finally spoke, breaking the silence. “We’ll only demand half the value of the Essence.”
A desperate attempt at compromise, thrown out as we were all hurtling towards the cliff. 
“Hmm, half…,” I mused. “In truth, we suffered the most losses during the raid, pushing the Layer Lord to the brink.” 
And to top it off, we had lost fourteen members.  Replacing each of them, all elites, would take years and cost a fortune.  Even with half the value, it wouldn’t cover the cost of broken equipment and supplies.  
The Dagger-wielder continued his speech, pressing his case. “Of course, the Essence’s value will be based on the appraisal given by the Guild's committee—.”
I didn’t need to hear more.
“I appreciate the offer, but I decline,” I stated, cutting him off abruptly.  The Dagger-wielder blinked, dumbfounded.  “Decline…?”
Surprised?  What a ridiculous expression.  The common rule was that the ones who failed to hold their prey had no claim to the spoils.  It wasn't without reason adventurers prided themselves on their integrity.  
The moment you back down, your claim is forfeited.  This guy had no guts to see it through.  “But why should I concede? They’re bluffing, and I’ve seen through it.  To refuse to call their bluff is just plain foolish.”
I was ready for this moment. I leaned in, my voice firm. 
“I’ll warn you, even if you cut that offer in half, my answer won’t change.  So cut the crap and fight.”
It was the first time I had used such aggressive taunts.  However, he still didn’t draw his weapon and attack.  He merely continued his endless chatter.
“...Calm down. Think rationally.”
“I’m as rational as I’ve ever been.”
“You're reckless, Lord Yandell.”
“Don’t talk to the Royal Family’s lord like that.” 
“Can you truly… handle this?”
Enough already. 
“Think I’d be here if I was scared? I don’t bluff like you.”
“I give you three seconds.”
“...”
“If you don’t leave my presence within that time, I’ll assume you’re an assassin who came to kill me.”
“That’s absurd…!”
“One.”
As soon as the number left my lips, the Dagger-wielder closed his mouth tight.  His anxiety was clearly etched on his face. 
What should he do?  Should they just leave?  No, how could they possibly just charge in like that?  We have so many more people than them.  
…But, maybe that's exactly what this barbarian would do.  He’s unpredictable.
“Two.”
In that brief moment, he must have gone through a thousand anxieties, yet he still hadn’t made a decision.  Understandable.  He’d only recently become the vice-captain.  Making important decisions like this wouldn’t be easy.
Therefore……. 
“Three seconds are up.”
I decided to give him a push. If I swung my hammer, maybe it would give him the courage to act.
“...Vice-Captain!”
Suddenly, an archer on his right stepped forward and whispered something into the Dagger-wielder’s ear.  They’d turned on their ‘voice control’ magic, so I couldn’t hear.  
I was just about to intervene, thinking they were up to something, when...
“Sir, adventurers are approaching.”
“...What?”
“There are roughly a hundred…,” 
A hundred…?  Where the hell had they all…
“It’s likely the group who was with us earlier,” 
Ah… they had been with us, hadn’t they?  I was surprised, thinking they might be his friends.
“It’s good news… for now?”
The Dagger-wielder turned his head, confirming the report, his expression contorted with anger. The same report must have reached him.  
With no way to handle this quietly, he had only one option left. 
“Everyone, put down your weapons,” he commanded. “Let’s leave this place!”
Right.  As the command was given, the members of his clan began to disband their formation and prepare to leave.  
Did he feel like he was leaving with nothing?  He turned around before leaving, making a final statement. 
“...We'll see you in the city, Lord Yandell.”
Sigh.  Now I have even more work to do back in the city.  
***
After the Tusk clan left, I waited.  Soon, the hundreds of low-level adventurers arrived. 
“Ooh, Vice-Captain! Congratulations on your incredible achievement!”
“Haha! I always knew it! You’d succeed, Vice-Captain!”
The warriors rushed towards us, cheering.  I would have been crushed, so I used [Gigantification], pushing them back, then sought out one of the warriors, asking him about the situation. 
“Lewis Syur! What the hell happened?”
“You see, sir… everyone wanted to express their gratitude for slaying the Layer Lord.”
So, they rushed here, towards where we vanished?  Their hearts were in the right place. 
“Well, should I be grateful for this, too?”  It was thanks to them, after all, that everything ended without bloodshed. 
“I might need their testimony when I return to the city.”  
I finished calculating, then approached the other adventurers, greeting them and asking their names.  But for some reason… 
“You’re Bent Maheil, right? I remember.”
“...It's an honour, sir!”
As I continued my introductions, the low-level adventurers looked at me strangely. 
“He's so polite, even to someone like us.”
“He's from a different race, but a truly worthy person to be respected.”
“Yes, he’s undoubtedly a hero.”
Uhhh… I just asked for their details.  
The situation felt like I was unknowingly conning them, but I didn’t correct them.
“Character’s Reputation increased by +1.”
“Character’s Reputation increased by +1.”
“Character’s Reputation increased by +1.”
“Character’s Reputation increased by +1…”. 
“…”
Well, if I can farm Reputation, I’ll farm it.  
“Well, we should be going.”  
I had learned the names and locations of everyone.  With no further need to stay, I left.
“Leaving?  Are you heading to the upper floors?”
“No, I have other things to do.”
There was no point in going to the fourth floor anyway.  Even if I entered on the fifteenth day, the Labyrinth would close before I reached the fifth floor.  To be honest, I just needed to rest after such a chaotic day.
“Sir, where are you heading now?”
As we moved away from the crowd, Erwen asked about my destination, and I simply answered. 
“To the Witch’s Hut.”
“The Hut? You mean… the sanctuary in the forest?”
“Yes, that’s right.  But why are you going there?”
Why?  Why would I go there?  Tsk, this is why newcomers are so clueless.  We just killed a Layer Lord, for goodness sake!
“Achievement Unlocked.”
Condition: Slayer of the Chaos Layer Lord, Riakis.
Reward: ???
I need to claim that achievement reward!
