## The Tomb (3)
It doesn't make sense. How could the information about the name I just gave to that creature be contained within this book, just a day after I named it? 
“How is that even possible? We just arrived here,” Erwin said, her voice laced with disbelief. 
“The details are accurate too. Yandell, do you know anything about this?” Misha asked. 
“Well…,” I replied, my voice hesitant, but deep down, I knew what was happening. 
A subtle feeling, an intuition that I couldn’t quite articulate, linked this phenomenon to something else.  
“The Chronicle Stone…,” I murmured under my breath. 
The stone said to contain the history of the world, from its very beginning to its eventual end.  
This phenomenon definitely had something to do with it. Even the name of this place, as clearly stated in the book, was “Record Archive.” 
“The more I explore, the more confusing it gets…,” I muttered, feeling a headache forming. 
I had been lost in thought for a moment, but I quickly snapped out of it. I could ponder over this later. 
“This must be one of the mysteries of this labyrinth. Everyone, stop thinking about it. We need to continue our task,” I announced, attempting to regain control of the situation.
“Right! Research and investigation are for mages, not for us! We just have to explore!” Ainar chimed in, her voice filled with excitement. 
I chuckled and began to read the book more carefully, focusing on the sections I had skimmed earlier. While the origin of the name was somewhat shocking, the book itself was incredibly helpful. Unlike the city's records, this book contained precise numerical values.
[Agility +8, Lightning Resistance +15, Jumping Power +30, Soul Strength +20]
Instead of the usual classifications of high, medium, and low, the book listed the basic stats in numbers.  
It also revealed the colors and effects of each essence, something I had been curious about.
Green essence: [Iron Feather]. 
Yellow essence: [Thunder Thorn]. 
Blue essence: [Bubble].
I had a hunch that this information might not be worth much to the mages at the Tower, as they’d likely spend a fortune on their research, just to write a paper and gain some recognition. But for us, this knowledge could be very valuable. It would undoubtedly sell for a hefty price.
“Let’s continue!” I exclaimed, eager to test this new knowledge. 
After absorbing all the information I could, I used the book to summon monsters.
“You’ve defeated a Nightflyer.”
“You’ve defeated a Muguri.”
The battle ended in an instant. The stone gate closed, revealing a staircase leading to the third tier of the bookshelf. 
We continued in this manner, pulling books off the shelves, checking their contents, and summoning monsters whenever we found books with summoning spells. If we found summoning books, we’d throw them to the first tier and have the waiting team handle them, accelerating our progress.
“You’ve defeated a Frost Wolf.”
“You’ve defeated an Ice Golem.”
“You’ve defeated a Death Knight.”
“You’ve defeated a Bycundus.”
“You’ve defeated a Minotaur.”
“…”
As expected, the monsters in the books on the higher tiers were more numerous, stronger, and more challenging to defeat. Honestly, this place wasn’t a bad hunting ground at all.
“So, no new monsters, huh?” 
Unfortunately, I hadn’t yet found any books with pictures of new monsters. I had been really looking forward to that.
“Maybe you need to catch one first?”
That was a possibility, but we didn’t have enough data points to confirm it. Besides, we still had many tiers to go through.
Days passed, and we continued this repetitive labor of hunting. We dedicated ourselves to slaying monsters, only taking breaks to sleep and eat.  As a result, we quickly climbed many tiers and collected a significant number of data points.
Based on the information we gathered, we found:
1. New monsters are not depicted in these books.
It is unclear if new monsters no longer exist or if only the ones that have already been “discovered” appear in these books.  That is something we’ll need to investigate further.
2. This library is not a good hunting ground.
It’s an amazing hunting ground. It’s the most efficient field for obtaining stones and essences.
The monsters always emerge through a stone gate.
It’s easy to form groups and fight as a team.
We can prepare for the summoning before it happens.
We can even cast spells and skills beforehand.
In the mid to later tiers, there were over 100 monsters per book.
This needs no further explanation. 
This field is already highly specialized for mass hunts, and you don’t need to wait for the monsters to respawn after each hunt. You just summon them again.
In fact, we earned nearly 10 million stones from just the stones alone in the past three days, and we found seven essences.  Of course, six of them were 6th-grade or lower, so we just discarded them and only kept the one 5th-grade essence. 
“Honestly, it’s not a bad place for hunting, but…,” I mused, a slight frown on my face.
Despite this, none of us were satisfied with our hunt. 
Our purpose wasn’t to hunt. This is the first region ever discovered by humans, and we could gain more from exploring the unknown than from simply hunting monsters.
“The problem is… we can’t clear the entire place, not with our current skill level.”
Judging from our progress, we have passed the mid-point and are now approaching the late-game.  Clearing the final stages is simply unrealistic.
“If 3rd-grade monsters spawn here, then that means there are 1st-grade monsters out there somewhere.”
Considering everything, I thought it was probably time to end our exploration of the library… 
That’s when Ainar’s voice echoed through the halls, loud and clear.
“Bjorn!!!”
Ainar, who was standing on a bookshelf far away, called out to me, her voice filled with excitement.
“I found a new book with a new monster!!!”
What? Really?
***
Ainar’s shout brought everyone together. We were all curious and slightly suspicious, but Ainar confidently showed us the book.
The creature depicted in the book was covered in tendrils resembling tentacles.  It walked on all fours, and its back sported something resembling bone wings. 
“What do you think? Have you ever seen a creature like this?” Ainar asked. 
“Definitely… I’ve never seen anything like it,” Erwin said. 
“What about you, Yandell?” Misha inquired.
“Me neither,” I replied.
It seemed like a new monster, but why was it appearing now?
“Read it quickly! What rank is it? It looks really powerful!” Ainar urged.
I felt a sense of unease, but I read the ancient language, making sure everyone could hear. 
“Its name is Tentaculan. It dwells in the Sea of Records.”
“The Sea of Records? The one with Muguris?” Misha asked.
“Yes, but don’t interrupt,” I snapped.
“Oh, sorry!” Misha apologized.
“It’s a 4th-grade monster, classified as a beast-type.”
“Wow! 4th-grade! What about its skills? What are its skills?” Ainar asked, her voice brimming with anticipation.
Don’t interrupt, I said. But she didn’t listen, so I sighed and continued reading.
“Its inherent skill is [Pacifist], similar to the 4th-grade creature Sea Merchant.  Its active skills are [Voice of Evil] from Gargoyle, [Stone Curse] from Medusa, and [Underwater Roar] from Leviathan.” 
“So, there are actually monsters with mixed skills from other species in this tier?” Erwin asked.
This was now a confirmed fact. New monsters with unique essence combinations were spawning in this tier.
“The monsters that spawn in this library need to be discovered in order to appear in the books.” 
This was the new information we learned.
“Wait, so we didn’t discover this creature?” Ainar asked, confused.
I nodded and read the origin of its name, verbatim.
“The explorer Maddikin Lylgriams discovered this creature for the first time in the Record Archive on the first floor, and he named it.”
“Maddikin Lylgriams? That’s the leader of the Silver Lion Clan, right? The one who entered this labyrinth with us…?” Erwin said, a hint of resentment in her voice.
“He said he’d die without us, but I guess he’s exploring well enough on his own,” Amelia remarked, clearly annoyed that someone else was getting ahead of us.
Who cares if he’s getting a name in this book?  It’s not like we’re getting paid. 
Oh, maybe it’s because her name isn’t in the book, yet, and she’s annoyed that someone else’s name is there?
“If we find a new monster, we’ll let her name it,” I thought to myself.
We’d learned all we needed about this new creature, so we descended to the first floor and began summoning.
“Grrrrrrrrrr…,” 
The monster was much larger than its image in the book. It was interesting to note that it looked like a wolf, except for its tentacles.  Why would something like this dwell in the sea?
“You’ve defeated a Tentaculan.”
The fight itself was straightforward, despite being our first encounter. We avoided simply overwhelming it with our raw power and fought it strategically.  But even so, the limits of a 4th-grade monster were clear.
“It was easier than I thought,” Misha said.
Wow, she’s really gotten stronger. I mean, look at her, chopping up a 4th-grade monster with a single blow.
“Okay, everyone, gather around,” I said.
After the hunt, we gathered our members for a vote. We had one question to decide:
“Should we stay here, or should we explore other regions? Share your thoughts.”
But the response wasn’t good.
“What’s the point? You’re going to decide based on the majority, anyway,” Erwin said.
“Yeah, that’s right,” Misha added.
Hm, did I use my trump card too early? I should have used my Multiple Vote Technique for something more important.
“Don’t worry. I’m abstaining from this vote.”
I said this decisively, and my team members, who had been giving me skeptical looks, nodded.
“Hmmm, well in that case…”
“It makes sense,” Misha said.
Finally, the voting started, and to my surprise, the consensus was unanimous: We were going to end our exploration of the library and explore other regions.
This was what I expected, though. We were already unhappy with the repetitive hunts, and this Tentaculan incident only poured gasoline on the fire.
“This place isn’t bad, but with competition, it’s too much of a waste of time. People are finding new monsters and naming them right now.”
“They’re probably selling the essences to the Tower for a high price.”
That’s the spirit.  We’re explorers.
We agreed to leave, but I decided to spend a day or two more in the library. 
“Why are we staying?  Isn’t it out of character for you to waste time?”
My teammates looked at me, implying that I was trying to use my position to get my way.  
They felt a little betrayed.  I’m just acting as a leader and acting efficiently.
“We’re now encountering 3rd-grade monsters in the books. We should hunt all the ones we can before we leave.”
We can easily handle 3rd-grade monsters with our current power, even if we can’t take on 2nd-grade monsters yet.
“Besides, Amelia, you still haven’t collected all the 3rd-grade essences you need.”
“Well… that’s true.”
“Ainar, you still haven’t found the essence I told you about.”
“Ugh!”
Ainar wasn’t the only one. Erwin, Misha, and I all still have essences to collect. I need to find the Bellarious essence, for example.
“So, do you all agree?” 
“…”
Silence means agreement. 
Now that we have a plan, we hunted more diligently than before.
“You’ve defeated a Mechanical Giant +EXP 7.”
“You’ve defeated a Phoenix +EXP 7.”
“You’ve defeated an Earthvine +EXP 6.”
“You’ve defeated a Garshian +EXP 7.”
“You’ve defeated an Abyss Skeleton+ EXP 7.”
“…”
The fights were tougher than those in the mid-tiers, but the rewards were sweeter. Because of the war on the 7th floor, we managed to hunt more than half of the 4th-grade and 3rd-grade monsters we had been missing.
The only downside was that we only managed to trigger [Beginner’s Luck] once. 
“No.9999 Beginner’s Luck has been triggered.”
But at least we got the Abyss Skeleton essence.  It’s not a very valuable creature to hunt, but it spawns only on the 10th floor.  None of us can use it, but since it’s a 10th floor essence, it has good value, so it was a decent reward.
“Come to think of it, the rare creatures I’ve seen in the labyrinth rarely appear in the books either.”
The Bellarious, for example. I was hoping to find him, but he just hasn’t appeared yet.
“That’s it. We’re done with the 3rd-grade hunts for now.”
Unfortunately, it was time to stop. The difficulty was getting higher, and now we’re encountering two 3rd-grade monsters per book.
We have a good enough team to handle those, but we need more rest time, which makes it less efficient.
“Everyone, pack your books. We’re leaving.” 
“Books?”
“Someone else might come here. If they only take the books from the top tier, they won’t be able to climb higher than we did. They can summon monsters all day long from the books downstairs, but the stairs won’t appear.”
“But won’t we run out of space in our sub-space bags with all these heavy books?”
“If it gets full, just throw them in the sea.”
“What? Yandell, you really…,”
“Really?”
“Smart. Especially here.”
Amelia and everyone else liked my plan. No one called it cowardly.  
We’re all explorers, after all.
“Of course, in this industry, this is fair competition.” 
We made the entire field impossible to clear, then retraced our steps back to the entrance.
Woosh, woosh.
While my teammates were forced to jump up each step, I ascended effortlessly.  As we reached the last step, we found something unexpected.
“Hey, Baron Yandell?”
There were explorers at the entrance, standing in a battle formation, weapons drawn.
