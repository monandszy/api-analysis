## Dilemma (7)
One, two, three, four.  With each attempt to establish communication with the main force, a chilling premonition tightened its grip on me.  There was nothing else I could do.
“Try again.”
“Yes… .”
I simply kept trying, though the main force remained unreachable no matter how many times I tried to contact them.  
“What the hell is going on?”
Our original plan was as follows:
1.  Surprise attack and infiltration of the base.
2.  Contact the main force, stationed in the Dragon Mountains, using the Eye of the Sky.
3.  Destroy the target, escape, and rendezvous with the main force for our retreat.
This was the core of the attack plan – the main force would temporarily combine their strength to break through one of the enemy’s lines, and we would meet at the predetermined point to be escorted back. 
But… 
“It’s a failure.” 
Communication with the main force, our lifeline, was impossible.  
“Could they… have abandoned us?”
The dreadful possibility flashed through my mind, but I quickly shook my head.  Abandoning such a large force after just one use? The Royal Family wouldn’t do such a thing.  It was far more likely that something had happened to them.  No, even in the worst-case scenario, there was only one thing I needed to do.  Just as it was on the very first day I awoke in this body.  
KWOAANG-!
To survive.
“Captain! How much longer must we hold out?!”
“Sir! The Priestess says she’s reached her limit!”
We were running out of time.  We had to make the best choice with our limited resources.  What would best ensure our survival?  
The decision didn’t take long.  Although I couldn’t be certain this was the best choice…
Toktok.
Alright, let’s go with this.  There’s no other better way.  
“Akuraba.”
“Yes, Captain.”
“Completely disable the communication coordinates.”
Until now, we’d only attempted to contact them by dialing a specific number.  But…
“What? If we do that, our messages will be broadcasted to the entire continent without any restrictions.”
“That’s exactly what I want.” 
What’s the point of leaving a missed call for someone who’s not even picking up? 
“…Alright.”
Akuraba seemed to ponder my meaning for a moment but eventually accepted without objection.  
And… 
“It’s done. I’ve also adjusted the bandwidth to the maximum.” 
Akuraba handed me the message stone, which was now fully configured.
Click.
I carefully pressed the button.  I was a little nervous.  The current setup is similar to a radio broadcast.  Enemies and allies alike, anyone with a message stone switched on will receive the transmission across the entire continent. 
But…
“Listen up, everyone.”
So what?
[Listen up, everyone.] 
The transmission echoed as every message stone in the area simultaneously emitted the signal.  It’s all the main force’s fault for not taking our calls.  Whatever they’re busy with, they’ve plugged their ears.  What else can a Barbarian do?
“The Eye of the Sky has been destroyed.”
[The Eye of the Sky has been destroyed.]
I had no choice but to hammer the message into their deaf ears.
***
A desolate wasteland, painted in drab colours.  And…
“… .”
The shattered remains of the ‘Eye of the Sky’.
Swoosh.
A man shed his robe, revealing his hidden face.  His skin was scarred and grotesque, as if it had been bathed in acid.
“…What happened here?”
The disfigured man surveyed his surroundings, and those who met his gaze quickly lowered their heads.
“You.”
The man reached out and grasped the neck of the closest explorer.
“C-Cough, C-Cough! Please, s-spare me! L-Lord Regal Bagos!”
“If you want to live, tell me what happened here.”
“I-I will! I-I will tell you… everything without holding back!”
The explorer, whose neck was being squeezed, desperately pleaded.  Regal Bagos loosened his grip slightly.  He needed to hear their story, even if he was going to punish them.
[I repeat, the Eye of the Sky has been destroyed.]
[We’re heading towards the rendezvous point now.]
The message stone had gone dead after that communication, so he could only rely on the explorers to understand what happened at this location.  That’s why…
“So you’re telling me that they brazenly infiltrated, destroyed the Eye of the Sky, and escaped using Mass Teleportation, and you just stood there and watched, doing nothing?” 
Rage boiled within him with every word.
“W-Well, see, Lord Regal Bagos left for the frontlines, and the force was—.”
“You’re blaming me?”
“C-Cough! N-No! It’s just that they came with monsters as their cowardly backup… we couldn’t match them! We, we were outmatched!”
“…Trash.”
Regal Bagos tightened his grip.  Terrorized, the explorer coughed out a name.
“T-Titan Akuraba!”
“Titan Akuraba…?”
The man recognized the name.  She was one of the most renowned explorers when he joined Orculis, a long time ago.
“That old hag was there…?”
“N-Not just her! T-The Golden Hawk, James Kala! White Sword Kaislan! There were so many famous explorers! Please, have mercy!”
The explorer, sensing his death was imminent, trembled as he begged for mercy.  At that moment, a man slowly walked towards them from the distance.  
“Lord Bagos, please stop. They couldn’t have done anything.”
Kael Elbard Jeneger.  He was the strategist of their group.  He’d also been the one who cautioned against rushing in when they heard about the Royal Family’s infiltration through Icerock. 
Was that why…
He wished he’d listened to this guy.  But a sense of defiance also simmered within him.  
“Kael, don’t you dare interfere. I’m about to deliver a just punishment.”
“Then, why him? Everyone here bears responsibility for failing to protect this place. It’s not fair.”
“Then, we’ll punish everyone here.”
At his words, the explorers trembled.  The man who’d offered advice sighed and played his final card.
“…The Guild Master wouldn’t stand for it.” 
The head of Orculis.  The traitor, Ricardo Luhen Praha.
“This bastard…!”
Regal Bagos was furious at the mention of the name, and he grabbed the strategist by the collar.  But that was all he could do.  Even he couldn’t ignore that name.
“Such a major incident happened, so the Guild Master, who was on the front lines, will soon return to assess the situation. Let’s wait patiently without rash actions for now.”
“…Tch.”
Regal Bagos finally suppressed his rage.  He’d already been reprimanded for venturing out without permission, so he didn’t want to give the Guild Master another reason to punish him.  But…
“The Bloodfiend’s man? Rhen Schuitz?”
“Y-Yes! Absolutely! He was the head of the expedition. I heard him called Schuitz.  Most importantly, he used [Gigantification]!”
As Regal Bagos, who had calmed down, investigated the ‘that guy’ who’d tricked them, he flinched.  His body shuddered upon hearing the word [Gigantification],  a strange feeling of déjà vu washing over him.  
“Kael!”
“Yes, Lord Bagos?”
“Get me the message stone.”
The strategist, without even questioning the command, retrieved the message stone.  Regal Bagos snatched it from him.
Click. 
He manipulated the button and played the recorded message.
[Me? Your front yard.]
[So what if you know? Are you going to come find me?]
[Yeah, go for it.]
That guy’s voice, enough to make his fists clench.  At the same time, it sounded familiar.
Click, Click, Click.
Regal Bagos repeatedly replayed the recording, and then released his clenched fist, letting out a hollow laugh.
“…No wonder his voice sounded familiar.”
So that was it.  Finally, Regal Bagos realized the identity of the voice.
[I repeat, the Eye of the Sky has been destroyed.]
[We’re heading towards the rendezvous point now.]
The enemy he’d failed to remember for over three years, thanks to Amelia Rainwales’ betrayal, since he recovered his body and regained his memories.  The thief who stole his precious sword, which he’d earned at a great cost.  He thought he was dead, but…
“He’s alive.”
The Royal Family must know about this guy.  No, perhaps the Royal Family was the one who orchestrated this whole thing to make him seem dead.  Or perhaps it’s impossible for someone like Akuraba to be involved in an expedition with a leader like ‘the Bloodfiend’s man’.  
“Bjorn Jandel.”
He whispered the name, recalling his anger from that day, and then stood up.
“Kael! Gather all the forces! We’re going to track down the fugitives!”
“But the Guild Master hasn’t arrived yet—.”
“It’s settled. I’ll take full responsibility.”
It’s time to meet again.
***
Deadwood.
Located in the western part of the Dragon Mountains, a field that had never been allowed to fall under the Royal Family’s control during the war… and the predetermined rendezvous point with the Royal Family.  
“… .”
They wait there, bated breath, believing that the main force will come to their rescue, as they couldn’t have missed the message they sent.
“… .”
They huddle together among the lifeless branches of the giant trees, their anxiety mounting.  This had already been going on for three days.
“If they received the message and immediately mobilized the main force, they should have arrived yesterday.”
“Why… won’t they come?!”
“Lord Kaislan, lower your voice. We don’t have the magical energy left for sound suppression magic.”
Until yesterday, everyone was encouraging each other, saying that the main force would arrive soon.  But now, the mood is becoming increasingly tense. 
It’s natural.  They had their first casualty this morning.
“Philip Aintropy.”
An explorer from Lord Melend Kaislan’s team.  He was a navigator, and his skills were primarily centered on sailing, such as [Current Control], [Lightweight], and [Overabundance].  He died in the battle this morning. 
He had enough magical energy left, but the magic users ran out of stamina, causing their invisibility spell to momentarily break.  The Noark bastards spotted them while scouting below, and Philip was crushed to death during the ensuing battle.
And now, several hours later…
“Schuitz, this place isn’t safe either.” 
“We need to make a decision.”
The anxiety of the members reached its peak.  It’s inevitable.  By now, the Noark side would have noticed the absence of the people who died this morning.  As time passes, the search around this location will intensify.  The Noark bastards have been passing through this area much more frequently than before.
“We need to make a decision.”
“Hold on, a decision? What are you talking about?”
“We can’t stay here forever. If the reinforcements don’t arrive, we should abandon this place.”
“…W-What are you saying? You think the Royal Family abandoned us?”
“I didn’t say that.  It’s just… we’ve been unable to contact them, and… if they have their own reasons, it’s right for us to be proactive.”
“It makes sense, but I’m against it. Can we really go very far in our current state? If we get caught on the way, it’s a total wipeout.”
“So you want to wait?  Until when?  In two days, the magic users will run out of magical energy, and then it’ll be a total wipeout, won’t it?”
As always during an emergency, opinions were divided.
‘Sigh… .’
Even if Akuraba hadn’t said it, I already knew.  We have to make a choice, one way or another.
‘I’m going crazy.’
We have three options.  First, we stay here and wait silently.  If the best outcome occurs, we’ll all be rescued safely.  
But if the worst happens…
‘We’ll die here.’
The second option is to move without waiting and break through directly to the Royal Family’s territory.  Deadwood is much less important than the Dragon Mountains, so their front lines are thinner, and they have fewer troops.  That’s why we chose this place as the rendezvous point.  It’s not entirely a wild fantasy. 
But…
‘It’s too difficult with only thirty people.’
Even if only 10% survive, it would be a miracle.  The worst-case scenario would be the same as the first.
‘Then, is the only option to move to a different place?’
The third is a kind of perseverance strategy.  Just as the area around the base was empty, we might be able to hold out until the dungeon closes if we go to that area and hide.
‘We destroyed the Eye of the Sky, so information about us wouldn’t be shared far and wide.’
However, this option poses the greatest risk out of the three, as we’d be exposed to numerous variables for the longest period.  Even if we take the best actions, many sacrifices will follow.
‘No matter which choice we make, we’ll all die if the worst happens.’
The thought took me to a place where I couldn’t help but laugh.  Then, another thought came to me.  
If it’s a wipeout ending anyway, wouldn’t the first choice, which gives everyone a chance to survive if the best outcome happens, be the most rational?  It’s the Royal Family’s fault, so we can hold them accountable as well.  
“…That’s bullshit.”
“If we leave and the main force arrives! Then!  Then, we’ll be held accountable… Huh? What did you say?”
I ignored Kaislan’s question and spoke.  Even though I’m not confident in my choice…
Toktok.
Someone has to make a decision.  
“Everyone get ready. We’re leaving this place.”
“Y-You’re saying we’re not waiting for the main force?”
“That’s right. We’ve already had enough of the wind. Oh, and don’t worry too much.” 
I smiled at Kaislan.
“I’ll take full responsibility.”
