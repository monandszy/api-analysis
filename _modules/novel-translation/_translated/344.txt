##  The Return (3) 
“There’s no record of the Lion accessing Ghostbusters for the last two years and six months.”
I was initially quite taken aback by this statement, but after some thought, realized there was no reason to be overly concerned. At least this much was certain: 
‘They’ll have discovered my username, “Elfnunna” at most.’ 
After all, even Auril Gaviss had never been able to uncover someone’s real-world identity from the spiritual realm. 
Would a half-baked GM like this actually manage to do what even the old man couldn’t? Unthinkable. 
The real issue was the possibility of being banned from the community for revealing my username. 
But even that wasn’t a major problem, upon closer inspection. 
‘It’s not like I’d die if I couldn’t participate in the community.’
On the other hand, if I cowered, the consequences could be severe. That woman would immediately perceive my weakness. 
“Where have you been all this time?” 
More overt questions would follow. It was only a matter of time before the Lion’s mask slipped if I continued to evade them. 
So, instead of hiding, I decided to take a gamble. 
‘The best defense is a good offense.’ 
I made my decision, throwing the metaphorical dice,  trusting in that principle. 
After all, this was the same GM who had gotten into a real-world brawl after banning Baekho, nearly losing his life. 
As the saying goes, a nuclear weapon is the ultimate deterrent in war. 
Perhaps the only solution was to inflate my presence even further, make myself more formidable. 
The outcome remained uncertain, but… 
‘I’ll find out soon enough.’
I glanced around the room.
“...”
“...”
A deafening silence, so quiet that even the sound of breathing had ceased. 
Each pair of eyes converged on a single point: the gemstone on the round table, the arbiter of truth and falsehood.
I, however, was more interested in a different presence at the table.
Soul Queen. 
The GM's partner, wearing her queen's mask. 
Her eyes, usually so calm and collected, were now filled with disquiet. 
‘Why did it have to turn out like this?’ she seemed to be thinking, as if utterly unprepared for this turn of events.
“U, e, uh.”
Her mouth struggled to form words, only letting out a series of sputtering noises. 
Her hands echoed the same uncertainty.
“U, uh…?”
She reached out as if to stop something, but her hand hovered in mid-air, then fell limply.
She knew it.
She knew that gesture would not be enough to change anything. 
The deed was done.
Swooosh!
As if relishing the intense scrutiny, the gemstone emitted a flash of green light, a brief pause before its true pronouncements.
The tense silence ended.
“GM… this alchemist…?”
“Wait, I can’t wrap my head around this… how can that guy be a demon, no, how can he be the GM too?”
“Pshh, it’s been over two years since the Lion last appeared, and it’s been worth the wait. This revelation was a wild card from the very beginning.”
The members of the community erupted in a chaotic mixture of whispers and exclamations. 
One particularly keen ear caught my attention:
“But I’m more surprised by the Queen. We suspected she might be on the side of the management, but… ”
Ah, so that’s why they brought up my login record right in front of everyone. 
There was no need to hide it after all. 
It seemed that the Queen’s true identity had been partially revealed during my absence. Or perhaps, considering her personality, she had deliberately chosen to expose herself. 
But that wasn’t the most important thing now.
Ignoring the commotion around me, I kept my gaze fixed on a single figure.
“Deal with…”
Soul Queen, leaning on the table, stared me down. 
Her gaze was intense, but not menacing.
It was a simple matter. 
“C, can you handle…?” 
She stumbled over the words.
Who would be intimidated by such a hesitant question?
“I don’t know how you found out, but even after doing all this, you—“
I cut her off.
“I said there was no reason to be afraid.”
“...”
“You’re shaking.”
“!”
Soul Queen quickly looked down at her hands. 
They trembled like those of someone afflicted with a tremor. 
Click.
She gripped her wrist with her other hand, her eyes flashing back to me. Gathering her composure, as if she had finally made a decision, she took a deep breath.
“Fine, you want to play this way. My turn first this time.”
She laid her hand on the gemstone on the table, declaring that anyone not participating in this round should leave.
Of course, no one would dare leave in this situation.
And then…
“The Lion is Bjorn Jandel.”
The gemstone glowed.
***
1. The Lion is Elfnunna.
2. Elfnunna hasn’t logged into the community for the last two years and six months. That’s also true for the Lion. 
3. Therefore, the Lion is Bjorn Jandel.
Her conclusion was based on a logical deduction, so she must have been 100% certain. 
At least until she entered this round table today.
Swooosh!
The gemstone illuminated, its light radiating through the tense atmosphere, a tension that felt almost tangible.
“Red, it seems.”
As expected, the green light never appeared.
This gemstone doesn’t differentiate between truth and falsehood.
Soul Queen must have wanted to deliver a blow to my pride, but with my faith already shaken, it was merely a meaningless act of defiance.
‘But she doesn’t seem mentally fragile enough to not understand something so simple.’
Then what was the point of this pointless defiance?
The answer came through Goblin's question:
“Excuse me, isn’t Bjorn Jandel dead? The Lion is alive and right here… so why the question…?”
“There are many unanswered questions surrounding his death. Not even his allies saw him die with their own eyes.”
The possibility of Bjorn Jandel being alive.
She had brought this up, considering even that possibility. 
Her lack of faith resulted in the red light, but…
“Pshh, you must have known that kind of assumption would get you red, right?”
“I’m not going to answer that.”
Soul Queen averted her gaze.
It struck me then that she had simply been trying to gauge my reaction.
No, she absolutely had been.
Even when the gemstone glowed, her eyes never left mine.
‘…Hah, using this situation to test me in reverse. You’re really impossible to outmaneuver.’
I wondered what kind of judgment she would make based on my reaction, but I showed no outward sign of my anxiety.
My silence seemed to boost her confidence, though.
“Well, anyway, we got a red light, so I’ll just have to try again.”
Soul Queen nonchalantly declared her intention to retry, glancing at me.
And then…
“I can always make sure the Lion never sets foot in Ghostbusters again.”
She unleashed a truth, confirming her position on the management side, earning a green light. 
It was all within expectations. 
She had threatened me with banishment, but that’s the extent of her power over me. 
Unlike me.
“Pshh, I wouldn’t want it to be that way, though. Well, not that it’s even possible.”
“What do you mean?”
“Why would you leave me alone if I was banished? You guys hate Noir-arc so much, and I’m a Noir-arc native. You left me alone because you were curious about our information, weren’t you?”
“What does that have to do with anything?”
“Pshh, you’re right, aren’t you? That’s the answer. Anyway, that means they shouldn’t banish the Lion. We might hear some interesting stories from him later on, and… ”
Jester cut in.
“It’s better to not provoke someone you can’t handle, right?”
“Can’t handle?”
“Yeah. You know he knows the GM’s true identity, right? What are you gonna do, try and provoke him?”
He was hitting my weak spot.
It’s not like I would be able to say that myself without appearing foolish.
With Jester stepping in, I could save face. 
Similar to how thugs always have a lackey by their side.
“...”
Queen, unable to retort, turned away. I met Jester’s gaze.
He was smiling.
‘Good job, right?’ 
His eyes said it all.
***
Was this enough to make up for the humiliation I had endured in the past?
“Pshh, I’m just saying. I wouldn’t want to overstep my bounds.”
Jester, having said his piece, spoke with a refreshing cheer.
“Well, if we’re going in reverse order, I guess it’s my turn next?”
With that, the second round began in earnest. 
A story emerged, one that could not be brushed aside.
“Bjorn Jandel, about that goddamn bastard… he might not be a demon after all.”
Huh?
“Pshh, Baekho is the one who spread that rumor, you know.”
…Baekho?
He said I revealed my true identity?
While I was internally freaking out, Antler revealed even more shocking information with nonchalance.
“The initial source, though, was Misha Calstain, that woman.”
…Huh? Misha?
“It’s the same thing, right? She’s one of Baekho’s companions now.”
No, what the hell is that?
Why is Misha one of Baekho’s companions?
“Pshh, thankfully, we got a green light. I was thinking you guys wouldn’t know that the Catwoman is Baekho’s companion.”
My mind was swimming with unbelievable information, but I managed to keep my composure, determined not to let my surprise show.
The turn passed, and the next one came.
“Huu, not easy, is it?”
Goblin, who had received two red lights after revealing information about the war, successfully got a green light on his third try.
It was information about the internal affairs of the Reathralas Church.
It wasn’t surprising, considering he had a habit of selling out his own church when cornered.
“My turn again.”
Crescent Moon’s turn came up next.
My interest was piqued, given the earlier mention of Erwen, but the information presented was quite mundane.
It was about the war, after all.
The same was true for Antler, who came after.
“Pshh, looks like the royal family finally drew their sword this time, huh.”
Even Jester, who usually mocked Antler, seemed impressed, implying that it must have been significant information. But for me, the war was irrelevant right now.
I had a long list of things to deal with first: finding my scattered allies, clearing my demon accusation, and so on.
That's why I was actually quite interested in Fox's information.
Or rather, I should say, worried.
“A few months ago, a Double Number was acquired at the Alminus Central Exchange. A woman of unknown identity used it as collateral for a large loan, and the repayment date is approaching. We might even see the item at the exchange’s auction soon.”
Could it be… my Devil Smasher?
No, it can’t be.
That kindhearted Amelia would never do that.
“...”
I tried to rationalize the situation, but I could feel everyone’s gaze on me.
‘Ah, my turn already.’
I had already decided what to say, so there was no need to ponder further.
I slowly scanned the room, one person at a time. 
They all looked expectant, waiting to hear what I had to say.
Except for one.
“...”
Soul Queen’s expression was more anxious than expectant, probably because of what happened earlier.
She’s proud, but easily scared?
‘Well, I’ve kept them waiting long enough.’
I tapped the armrest of my chair twice,  just a meaningless gesture, then turned to Soul Queen.
“I asked if you could handle this.”
Now it was my turn to answer, or rather, my turn to ask.
And you?
Like Jester had pointed out.
Are you truly prepared for this?
The Queen’s slender throat twitched as she swallowed.
Without hesitation, I spoke.
“The Queen’s username is Soul Queen.”
As soon as I finished speaking, everyone’s gaze shifted to the gemstone.
I couldn't help but chuckle. 
They hadn’t even let me finish speaking.
“And Soul Queen’s real name is…”
I actually don’t know.
But I deliberately trailed off, my eyes fixed on her.
If she didn’t react, I could feign leniency by saying something like, ‘I’ll save that for later.’
“Hoo.”
I stalled, prolonging the suspense, and their interest intensified.
Jester’s expression was the most eager.
After all, he had been humiliated by this woman before.
“Hopefully she isn’t one of those types who stays locked away in the mage tower like the alchemist. That would make it difficult to kill her. Pshh, pshh…”
As Jester let out his chilling laugh, Soul Queen’s throat twitched again.
Tap, tap.
I tapped the armrest again, a meaningless gesture.
And that’s when…
“…S, stop it!”
The words I was waiting for finally came out.
“P, please stop… I, I don’t want…  my identity to be revealed here.”
Tsk, I knew it.
