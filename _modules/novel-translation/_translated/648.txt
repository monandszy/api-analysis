## The Barbarian Business (1)
Was it because I made my proposal with such a scam-like tone? 
"Big money... you say?"
The Clan Leader narrowed his eyes, his voice laced with skepticism. The look in his eyes was the kind that would have driven anyone else out of the room if it weren't for me. 
"Tell me, then. How do you intend to make a fortune?"
He did, however, grant me permission to explain. I rushed to elaborate before his negativity could deepen.
"It's an investment opportunity."
"...Investment? Do you have a merchant guild in mind?"
"No, it's not about investing in a guild."
"Then... ?"
"Let's invest in the land of District 7."
"Land... you're kidding, right?"
The Clan Leader's reaction suggested he thought I was spouting nonsense, but it wasn't a surprise. I had expected this. 
In this world, land purchases are hardly appealing, especially as investment assets.  To be precise, it's a privilege only afforded to 'nobility.'
'It's practically a  'rental' investment, offering consistent income.'
Most nobles with surplus land lease out their property and collect rent. They don't even earn capital gains from land appreciation.
It's unavoidable.  In this abnormal city, where magic stones replace all resources and consumption and circulation occur simultaneously, the value of currency rarely fluctuates. 
That's why Raphdonia's real estate has always remained stagnant, neither rising nor falling.
But...
"As you know, the current situation in District 7 is beyond dire. If we purchase now, we can do so at a bargain price."
"That's too simplistic a perspective. Surely they know District 7 will be rebuilt within a few years. No one would sell at a loss."
Well, that's true. 
Most nobles would simply wait it out. In normal circumstances, that is.
"You, on the other hand, are being too simplistic."
A massive event occurred - the closure of the Labyrinth. 
District 7, however, borders Bifron, which is occupied by the Noark forces.
"I heard that many families are hoarding their funds these days, not spending them."
Uncertainty about the future. And the ensuing anxiety.
Having expertly explained the situation, I spoke with conviction. 
"There will certainly be some nobles willing to sell if we look closely.  Once consumption starts to decline, the enterprises of the noble families will be severely impacted."
"You're right... there will be an increase in those who need money urgently."
The Clan Leader seemed to be accepting my arguments. 
It didn't mean I had convinced him, though.
"But the same goes for us. Even if we can buy this land at a bargain price, the realization of this investment will be a long time coming."
"That's true."
"As the Baron said, in these uncertain times, we cannot afford to wait that long. Not for me, not for any of us."
The Clan Leader was a seasoned veteran, and his observation was sharp. 
Just as other noble families needed money and were willing to sell land, so too did the families associated with Melbes.
Thus, a future-oriented investment was impossible. 
But...
'I think I've almost convinced him.'
I smirked and lowered my voice.
"What if we could purchase the land and fully recover our investment immediately? How would you feel about that?"
For the Clan Leader, a lifelong resident of Raphdonia, this proposition sounded like a mere delusion of a barbarian, an idea that couldn't possibly be grasped. 
His reaction was exactly as I expected.
"That's… a pointless assumption."
"Even so, answer me. What would you do if that were possible?"
Facing my persistent demand, the Clan Leader finally relented.
"Why ask me? Any noble would seize that opportunity if it existed."
"Hmm, I see."
"But how could such a thing realistically be possible? To buy land and recover the investment? It's not as if there's a way to get the land for free."
As he muttered skeptically, I declared firmly.
"There is."
Technically, it wasn't free, but it was close.
"Tell me, then. What is this method?"
"We lease out the land, but we don't collect rent."
No monthly or annual rent.
"What? No rent? That's preposterous—."
He was about to interrupt.
"Hear me out."
I interrupted the Clan Leader and continued my explanation.
"We won't collect rent on the land we purchase. Instead, we'll receive a sum equivalent to the land's value, granting them the right to freely use the land."
The Clan Leader, who had been listening intently, let out a loud chuckle.
"Hah! You're proposing to engage in land proxy purchases? That's a blatant violation of the kingdom's land laws!"
Land proxy purchase - a method often used secretly by wealthy merchants and affluent individuals who desired land ownership. 
It rarely got caught as it was seldom monitored, but it could be problematic if someone decided to make an issue of it.
But...
"Technically, it's not illegal. Proxy purchases require a clause in the contract explicitly stating permanent ownership of the land. I don't intend to include such a clause."
"...That could be interpreted as you've described. But then who would agree to such a deal? Simply paying rent is far cheaper and more convenient."
"They'll come. Unlike proxy purchases, which require an exorbitant premium of nearly three times the original price, I won't ask for a penny in premium."
"......"
"The money we receive will be returned in full when the contract ends."
"What?!"
Unfortunately, the Clan Leader, who had lived his entire life in this city, couldn't grasp the concept I was introducing.
"You'll return the money? Then they'll be getting the land for free, without paying rent!"
'Hmm... Is it really so difficult to understand?'
The Clan Leader believed this was solely a loss for us, so I had to spend more time explaining.
"Clan Leader, I'll only say this once, so listen carefully."
This is the very concept that even Koreans who are interested in real estate are divided on. Whether it's a good system or a bad one.
Why leasing out an 'apartment with a security deposit' is beneficial to us.
***
My plan is quite simple. 
We purchase the land in District 7 from noble families who need money.
Then we lease that land to merchant guilds or wealthy individuals for a substantial security deposit, without charging rent.
And...
'We can use that money to buy more land.'
We repeat the same process.
The Clan Leader questioned the feasibility of the plan, but after my explanation, the old man finally agreed.
"Indeed… if a proper building is erected on the dilapidated land, finding individuals who desire to enter into a contract will be easy. It'll be significantly cheaper in the long run."
Security deposits involve a significant outflow of funds.
However, given sufficient capital, a security deposit is more economically beneficial.
'After all, you don't have to pay rent.'
In this world, where depositing money in a bank yields negligible interest, why not?
If my prediction is correct, some people will even borrow from the bank, paying rent as if they were getting an apartment with a security deposit.
"I plan to discuss this matter with Count Alminers, the head of the bank. I want to see if ordinary citizens can get a loan with my contract to return the money as collateral."
"Th, this is… preposterous."
The Clan Leader murmured, but it was a different tone than before.
Before, he was criticizing a fantastical concept. Now, it's closer to an exclamation of wonder.
"Didn't the royal family decide to shoulder most of the cost for rebuilding the collapsed buildings this time!"
"That's right?"
"If this plan goes well... we can buy the entire District 7 with enough money to buy a small street or two!"
The Clan Leader was a native of Raphdonia, a bit set in his ways, but he was also a sharp businessman, and he seemed to have grasped the ‘business' I was proposing.
Though, in my opinion, not completely.
"You seem to have misunderstood something, Clan Leader. My goal is not to buy the entire District 7."
"...?"
"The goal is to buy the entire District 7 and then sell it at a higher price later."
"...!!!"
That was the heart of the plan.
After all, what's the point of buying all the land and leasing it out? What's the benefit to me?
We would only lose money unless the land value appreciates.
But, on the other hand, if the land value goes up, we could make a huge profit.
"Clan Leader, you know, don't you? The moment the situation calms down and District 7 is normalized, it will revert to its previous price."
This is a guaranteed win.
Unless the Noark bastards come outside the walls and flatten our District 7 during the rebuilding process.
'Uh... '
No, that won't happen, right?
I brushed aside the ominous thought. It's just a superstition that words can become reality.
"Anyway, think about it, Baron. If we pull this off, how much do you think we'll earn?"
"...What can I do to help?"
'Okay, that look in his eyes means I don't need to convince him anymore... '
I honestly told him what I needed.
This plan was impossible to implement on my own without the Clan Leader's active assistance.
From finding nobles willing to sell their land to securing funds for purchase and the capital to sustain the operation until buildings are erected and tenants are secured.
I needed the Clan Leader's help with everything.
With my limited connections, I wouldn't even be able to find nobles to sell their land.
"I'll say it again. Don't buy the land unless it's a real bargain. We're the only ones crazy enough to buy land during this period."
"Don't worry about that. I've done countless negotiations like this in my life."
Yes, this is it.
A family that has endured for thousands of years, with the network that comes with it.
And the skills in negotiation developed through years of combining politics and business.  The Clan Leader will deliver the results I expect.
"However, it's difficult to make such a big decision right now. I need some time to think about it. I'll get back to you."
The Clan Leader tried to back out at the end, but I coolly nodded.
After all, I could see he was already hooked.
"Alright."
She will surely contact me soon.
**
Introducing the security deposit system to Raphdonia.
This will undoubtedly bring me great benefits.
My only concern is whether this capitalist approach will appear too demonic.
'It's not a particularly sophisticated technology. The security deposit system itself is something anyone could think of.'
Of course, Koreans who know the security deposit system might be suspicious of my actions.
But...
'There are only three of us Koreans in this world, anyway.'
Lee Baekho, Kang Hyunbyeol, and me.
And all three of us already know my true identity.
There might be other Koreans hiding somewhere in this world, but...
The risk is worth it.
I am no longer the same me who trembled before the demon hunters of the Secret Security Agency.
Now, I have the means to protect myself.
More importantly, I have a bit of insurance in place.
"Could it be... that all this is coming from Baron Yandell's mind?"
"Nonsense! Our Administrative Director came up with this method. Working on building houses at the sanctuary has made him very sharp in this area."
"You mean Shavin Emure, the administrative officer?"
"That's right. He recently got a promotion."
"...I don't know what to think. Are these talented people gathering around Baron Yandell by sheer luck... or is it because they're able to shine because they're by his side?"
The Clan Leader's gaze held a hint of envy, which made me a little embarrassed.
But a seasoned warrior never misses an opportunity.
"Well, I guess we'll find out firsthand, won't we?"
I smirked and added a final touch.
"You're part of my team now."
Surprisingly, these kinds of emotional lines work well on seasoned veterans.
