## Chapter 555: Déjà Vu (4)
109 days into the Labyrinth. Or, to put it another way, early the next morning after joining the expeditionary force sent by the royal family and arriving at the library.
*Baa-ba-ba-bam! Baa-ba-ba-bam! Para-la-la-para-la-la-bam-*
The wake-up call, played by the military band, echoed throughout the library, signaling the dawn.
Ugh, is it just me, or is the military the same everywhere?
*…I wonder if Baekho would get mad if I said that.*
It’s not like I’m exempt from basic training just because I’m in public service. 
Anyway, the bugle call, devoid of any time wasted on dawdling, roused everyone instantly. As soon as the bugle call ended, the daily routine began.
"Breakfast is ready!"
Right after tidying up the campsite, we lined up in front of the cooks who had risen early to prepare breakfast.  We devoured the food in a short 30 minutes.
Then…….
"The morning meeting will be held shortly, all commanders are to attend.”
The leaders gathered to discuss the day's plan and receive a briefing on the predetermined agenda. I pricked up my ears, hoping for something interesting, but nothing of consequence was mentioned.
*Just another day of hunting, just like yesterday.* 
Of course, there are subtle differences. Yesterday, we destroyed the door, preventing its restoration, and summoned monsters at an insane pace. But, as the monster ranks have increased, we'll be engaging in a more conventional strategy this time.  The mages will naturally be participating in the battle as well.
"Alright, let's get started on our mission with vigor today!"
I wondered if we truly needed a meeting to announce this, but I guess that's the way the military works. 
Sticking to formalities might seem inefficient at times, but the process can also prevent unforeseen accidents.
"To your posts!"
Each team took up their designated positions, and the library assault resumed.
"Looks like the battle teams will be taking turns again today."
"That's the most efficient way to do it."
Over 200 people.
It would be like using a butcher's knife to slaughter a chicken if everyone participated in the battle. Therefore, Jerome opted for a shift system.
"Hold! Teams 1 and 2, swap positions with Team 3 and the temporary Team 4!"
As the time came, Teams 1 and 2, who were guarding the stone door, stepped aside. Team 3 and Team 4, who had been selecting books from the shelves, took their place. Teams 1 and 2, in turn, took over the task of carrying books and recovering from the depleted stamina and resources.
*Kailslan and Parav will be at odds again today.*
For your information, both of them are members of Team 1. That's why they eat their meals separately.
Well, at least Raven is in Team 3….
She's a mage, so she's usually stationed far back, so I rarely encounter her during missions anyway.
*…Looks like I'll have to talk to her about the oracle tonight.*
While diligently working as a cog in a machine that moved the entire group, I noticed a fellow who was engaging in a lively conversation with some of the knights from the expeditionary force.
“Ha-ha-ha! Don’t be ridiculous! A mage can’t possibly beat a warrior like us!"
“Precisely why it’s so humiliating! Who would have thought someone would lose a duel to a mage?!”
"When did that happen?"
"A month ago! But, of course, you wouldn’t know, since you were here. It’s a rather famous story within the social circles.”
Wait, how did they get so close?
Their ability to connect with people is truly remarkable. It’s actually beneficial to me, too.
“What are you talking about so merrily?”
“Ah… Sir Baron! My apologies. I— I was focused on—.”
“I’m not asking you to apologize.”
“Yes…?”
“Aren’t we all warriors? I’m curious too. A knight who lost to a mage? Who is this idiot?”
I casually joined their conversation, signaling my interest. The knight, after a moment of hesitation, began to recount the tale with a mischievous grin.
Did that catch attention?
The other knights from Team 3 also gathered around, listening to our conversation, occasionally adding their own comments or correcting misinformation.
*Well, they wouldn’t be thrilled with this factory-like work, either.*
Perhaps it was due to my Baron title, but the knights initially kept their distance. But once they saw my casual side, they seemed to feel a little closer to me. They started asking me questions.
“Sir Baron, I have a question…. Could I ask you something?”
“Of course, go ahead.”
"I heard that you challenged Baron Cypriot to a duel during your coronation.  What exactly happened?"
"Oh, that? It’s nothing much. A goblin-looking fellow was badmouthing me behind my back, you see? I wanted to punch him in the face, but I couldn't, so I challenged him to a duel.”
“Ha-ha…. Really? Baron Cypriot must have been shocked.”
“It’s his own fault. There are too many fools in the nobility. If you have nothing, you get beaten. That’s the natural truth.”
It was a cool joke, one only a peer of the nobility like me could tell. The knights seemed to love it, nodding in agreement.
"Well…. When have they ever done anything dangerous?”
“They’re safe because we protect them. It's an obvious truth that many don't understand…. "
Although they were still trying to maintain decorum, they cautiously joined in on the gossip.  But as I spun the story and continued my candid remarks, I could see their smiles widen, as if they were vicariously experiencing the satisfaction.
*Alright, I think I’ve made a good impression on them.*
I kept sharing my stories throughout the day, building camaraderie with the knights from the expeditionary force.
“Sir Baron… You're even better than the rumors say. Ah! I’m not trying to offend you! I just… didn’t know you were this down-to-earth and funny… ”
“Ha-ha! Why are you explaining yourself? Aren’t we friends now?”
“Friends, you say! Please, don’t say that! The Commander will be furious if he hears you!”
“Then comrades it is.”
“Comrades… Yes, comrades…  then…”
“So, I’ll leave my back to you in times of danger.”
“…You can count on us, Sir Baron!”
Connecting with people always pays off. 
***
That night, after spending the day chatting with the knights, I left the camping preparations to my comrades and headed toward the campsite of Team 1, where Sven Parav belonged.
After getting permission from the members of the church who were with him, I called him out.
“I’d like to continue yesterday’s conversation.”
“Ah… Ah, that, you say… ”
“The oracle you received. What was its content?”
The word “oracle” made him flinch. He quickly scanned his surroundings, confirming that our conversation was not overheard by others before letting out a long sigh. 
He lowered his voice and hedged his bets.
“W-well, I’d like to start by saying that it might have all been my imagination…”
“You said it was certain yesterday, didn’t you?”
“Yes, well, when you answer a yes or no question, you tend to be biased towards that side… It’s like… believing something yourself and seeing it from another’s perspective can be different… that’s the general feeling… ”
Oh, my god, this is infuriating.
“Alright, I'll make the judgment. You just tell me the content.”
“If you insist… ”
He closed his eyes for a moment, as if gathering his resolve, then reopened them and began to speak slowly.
“While I was in the city, I had a dream.”
"A dream?"
“It’s hard to explain… but, I heard a very sacred voice. And I knew instinctively… that it was her.”
“By her, you mean Reatlath?”
“Yes… that’s right.”
He had a dream about a goddess.
I have no idea why he believed it was an “oracle” just based on that, but for now, I decided to listen to the rest of his story.
“So, what did she say?”
"She told me I have a task to perform, and showed me a scene from the future.”
A prophetic dream.
It's the most common form of oracle received by saints and saintesses. 
That day, Parav saw a scene.
“It was a scene where the Archbishop told me to join the expeditionary force.”
The prophetic dream came true the very next day.
And thanks to that, he became convinced that this dream wasn't just a random dream, but a real oracle.
“And?”
"That's... it."
“What?”
"She said that she would reappear when the time is right, and told me to be prepared.”
In other words, the main quest will be given to me after entering the Labyrinth with the expeditionary force….
Honestly, I don't understand.
“…Why did you try to escape by pretending to have a stomachache? You said you received an oracle, right?”
“Oh, well… ”
He hesitated, trailing off.  Then, closing his eyes, he finally answered.
“An oracle… It’s definitely going to be a dangerous mission!”
“…What?”
For a moment, I was stunned, but he didn't care. He continued to reveal his true thoughts.
“Even if it's not dangerous, it's definitely going to be a pain in the neck. I, I had that kind of intuition too.”
What kind of person is this?!
This is why he hid the fact that he received an oracle.  Once it became public knowledge, everyone in the church would have sent him to different places to fulfill this oracle. 
*A holy knight doing that because he was scared of an oracle?*
I can’t believe it, but on second thought, I’m grateful. He kept it a secret from others, but he was honest with me.
*Loyalty… passed.*
“S-so… can I go now? They're watching me from over there.” 
He pointed towards the church group. They were indeed staring at us, though it wasn't so much hostility as worry.  It’s like they were watching a child playing by the river.
*They treat him like that, too….*
“Alright. If you have another dream, tell me immediately.”
“Yes, sir.”
"Good night."
“Yes.  You too, Sir Baron.”
After finishing my conversation with Parav, I returned to my campsite and tried to get some sleep. 
But again, I couldn't fall asleep easily.
*An oracle…*
The content of the oracle I heard from him today wasn't anything special. 
Just like how he tried so hard to avoid entering the Labyrinth.
Something big is coming.
That intuition was deeply ingrained.
Therefore, I could only do one thing.
To prepare for the coming tide, the incoming storm, so I wouldn't be swept away.
*I wanted to save it for as long as possible…*
But there’s nothing I can do now. 
Eventually, I made a decision under the covers in the dead of night.
*Bellarios’ essence.*
I need to consume it as soon as possible.
***
Day 111 into the Labyrinth.
Our exploration of the library had progressed significantly. We’d reached the area where 3-rank monsters poured out.
*It's only been 5 days since we arrived here.* 
I’m still amazed, but I can truly feel the power of the royal family.
Knights, mages, priests.
They gathered the most talented individuals from these precious professions and formed an army.  How can you even compare their overall value?  
*If this was the case, I could have gone straight to the Chieftain’s island.*
At first, I was opposed because I didn’t know if they were a reliable group, but now, I wish I’d gone straight to the Chieftain’s island and killed the Chieftain.
Even if the Chieftain possessed the essence of his human form, he wouldn’t stand a chance against this army.
“Sir Baron! We’ve found a book with a drawing of Bellarios!”
I was contemplating these thoughts during lunch when the good news came. The messenger was one of the knights from Team 3.  I’d asked them to inform me if they found Bellarios.
"Is it that book with the drawing of him in his arms?"
"Yes! We took it aside immediately after finding it!"
"Thank you."
"Thank you? We’re comrades, aren’t we!"
This was a result of my efforts to make a good impression on them. 
I gave the knight, who brought me the book, a ton of jerky, the highest level of respect a Barbarian could offer.
And then….
*Swoosh.*
When the ink on the tip of the forever pen that changes color every minute turned green, I quickly colored over the drawing of Bellarios in the book. 
I then went to find Commander Jerome Saintred. 
“Hmmm, you want to fight it with just your team?”
“Because we need that essence. We agreed that we’d recognize ownership over the essence we acquire ourselves.”
“That’s true, but is it really necessary? It’s a waste of time, so fight with the other teams.  Oh, and I’ll give you the essence if it drops. If it does, I mean.”
He readily agreed, going above and beyond by agreeing to help hunt Bellarios, seemingly not believing the essence would drop.
Therefore….
“I will summon it!”
I joined in and summoned Bellarios.
“Eliminate it!”
Bellarios, emerging from the stone door, had sleek scales, quickly turned to shreds by the knights and archers.  The creature disappeared in a flash of light, less than a minute after the battle began.
*Swoosh-*
A large gemstone.
Only leaving behind the essence.
“The essence… It actually dropped.  Huh? Where are you going, Baron?  Are you…  asking for the essence?!”
“Yes, it’s me.”
Leaving behind a seemingly confused Jerome, I quickly ran to absorb the essence.
「Bellarios’ Essence infiltrates the character’s soul.」
Alright, I’m finally eating this one.
“Behel—raaa—aaa—aaa—aaa—aaa—aaa—aaa—aaa!!!”
The day when my Shield Barbarian will be complete is not far off.
