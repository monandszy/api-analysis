The Shifting Sands of Fate (Chapter 5)
One minute, two minutes, three minutes… Time crawled, slower than any moment he’d ever experienced. Four minutes, five minutes, six minutes…  His anxiety intensified with each passing second. The air inside the seemingly comforting wardrobe felt suffocating, constricting him, his heart beating sluggishly.  He felt uneasy, profoundly uneasy. Seven, eight, nine minutes…  Was she alright?  Had she been discovered by other Noirks, and was she in grave danger? Images of misfortune swirled in the suffocating darkness.
Thump! It was a premonition, a familiar gut feeling. Only this time, the premonition wasn't about him, but about someone else. Ten, eleven, twelve minutes… Sven Parav remained motionless, his ear pressed tightly against the wardrobe door, intently focused on the sounds from outside.
Silence.
Silence.
Since Lilith Marone had entered the building across the street with the woman she was hiding, effectively shielding her from the immediate danger, there had been little to no discernible noise. She seemed to be well-hidden inside…
Click, click, click.
Each time a patrol of enemy soldiers passed by, a chill ran down Sven Parav’s spine.  This wardrobe was safe.  His intuition, which had saved him countless times, assured him of it. But…
Twenty, thirty, forty minutes… Could the same be said of the building across the street?  His intuition answered "no," a conclusion validated by objective observation. Had the building been truly safe, the woman wouldn’t have been captured by those underlings.  And, of course, there had been the earlier incident.
Click, click, click.
The rhythmic click of heavily armed soldiers echoed through the street once more.
Click.
Their steps halted before the building. He prayed for them to simply move on, but, as usual, his ominous premonition proved accurate.
“She disappeared while scouting this area?”
“Yes, sir. Her last reported location was right around here.”
“Hmph… Why the hell did she venture so far out on a sudden patrol, causing all this trouble?”
“Perhaps she was using the patrol as a pretext to search for something valuable.”
“Or perhaps… to find a woman.”
Silence.
The flippant, unmilitary conversation was distinctly Noirkish, a stark contrast to the usually disciplined Laphdonian army. Parav’s unease intensified. He could easily imagine the consequences of falling into the hands of such men. But…
Thump!
He reflected on his life, realizing that ominous events always seemed to thrive on his fear and anxiety. The more he feared and worried, the more those very fears manifested. Just like this.
“Hmm…? Wait a moment, I sense magic residue.”
“Magic residue…?”
“It's faded considerably with time, but it's unmistakable. Someone died here.”
“Can you tell us anything more?”
“Wait a moment.”
After an indeterminate time, the man spoke again, his voice barely a whisper. However, it was perfectly clear to Sven Parav, whose body was enhanced with sacred energy.
“Approximately one hour ago. Three people died here.”
“The number matches the missing persons.  And considering the time, the possibility of it being someone else is very low.”
“It appears they moved the bodies and used magic to erase any traces of blood.”
“Does that mean you can’t trace the perpetrators with your black magic?”
The man, presumably a commander, inquired, and Sven Parav silently wished for a different answer.
And…
“Hmm… Black magic is not omnipotent.”
“…Is that so?”
“But I can sense where the bodies were taken. They were moved into that house.”
“The perpetrators might still be inside. We should investigate.”
“Of course. They seem skilled, judging from the thorough cleanup… but even skilled individuals are often unfamiliar with black magic. I wouldn’t have known either, if I hadn't sensed the magic residue.”
“Let's send a report before we enter, just in case. Hey, Rex!”
The presumed commander called out to someone, who, looking like a terrified recruit, responded with a flurry of hurried words. He appeared to be contacting headquarters…
‘Damn it.’
His head swam again.  Should he intervene now to prevent them from contacting headquarters? Or should he simply remain silent? If they searched the house and didn't find Marone or the woman, it would still be the best-case scenario…
“Commander! I’ve finished reporting.”
Everything concluded before he could decide. The golden opportunity had been lost; now, all that remained was to observe.
“Form up.  We’ll search carefully, as the enemy’s strength is unknown.”
The Noirks cautiously entered the building, and an eternity of minutes and seconds stretched before him.  Thump, thump, thump…  He agonized over his choice, consumed by anxiety. That time ended after about seven minutes.
“…C-commander!”
KABOOM!
“AAAAAH!”
An explosion and screams shattered the silence. The battle had begun.
“…Gah, KYAAK!”
Marone, a military mage, fought desperately even after being discovered, but ultimately she was defeated.
“Damn it! Seven men dead because of that damned woman!”
THUD!
A dull thud, followed by a familiar scream.
“Gah…!”
“…Wait a minute, her face looks familiar…”
“…Lilith Marone! A comrade of Bjorn Jandel, the former military mage!”
“What…? Hahaha! Hahaha! This is a tremendous achievement!”
“If we take her alive, it will be an incredible accomplishment!”
Taken alive.
At that word, Sven Parav unconsciously clung to a shred of hope.  But…
“Hey, what are you talking about? That’s old news.  Higher-ups decided a long time ago that she didn’t need to be taken alive.”
“Oh… is that so?”
“But it would be a shame to let her die easily, wouldn’t it?”
“Yeah, seven men are dead because of her; we can’t just let her go easily.”
“M-my arm is gone!”
Even that tiny spark of hope was cruelly extinguished.
THUD!
Another dull impact echoed. Sven Parav closed his eyes and took a deep breath.
Thump!
His intuition beat in his chest, urging him. If, at this moment, he covered his ears and ignored it…
Thump!
He would live.
“But let’s get the information first. There might be other accomplices.”
Even though Lilith Marone risked her life to save others…
“…Hey! Tell me! Are you alone? Do you have accomplices?”
Silence.
“We’ll get a confession out of her eventually.”
He would live.
“Commander! There are more people in here!”
“…Kya, KYAAK!”
Even if innocent citizens would die…
“Leave those people alone!”
“Wow, look at her face change!”
He would certainly live.
But…
“WAAAAAH!”
“What? There’s a baby too?”
“P-please! Our baby! Please, save our baby!”
Was that right?
“No, no, NOOO!!!”
Sven Parav asked himself no more questions.
Sven Parav cast [Judgment's Blade].
“Huff… huff… huff…”
He ran, forcing his breath into a steady rhythm.  He had two reasons.  Regular breathing helps one run longer.
And…
“Chase them…!!”
He had to run to survive.
“Huff… huff… huff…”
Brown Rotmiller sprinted through the familiar forest path.  He hadn't deserted.  He had initially been forced to retreat from the city walls due to the onslaught of magic cannons, and subsequently, the complete collapse of the front line under overwhelming enemy numbers led to a retreat order. A perfectly reasonable explanation.
To feign retreat, spread the front line as thin as possible, then use that opportunity to lead the elite forces and take down the top brass?  He'd learned this information because he'd once been Jandel’s associate.  But…
Tat-tat-tat!
The weight of his former association was heavy, exceedingly heavy.
“That’s one of Jandel’s favorites!”
“Get him!  A minimum 3rd-grade essence is the reward!”
The relentless pursuit. That was the reason he was alone, running through the dense forest.  He had initially been with other Barbarian warriors, but it didn't take long to realize that this was more of a hindrance.
“Huff… huff… huff…”
So he ran, and ran again.  Unlike Jandel’s actual comrades, he couldn’t defeat dozens of soldiers. But if he kept running, he could tie up those dozens of pursuers.  It was the best an old retired guide and explorer could do.
Yes, so…
“Huff… huff… huff…”
He forced his screaming legs to move.
Thump, thump, thump, thump!
Ignoring the constant pounding of his heart, announcing its limits…
WHOOSH!
He detonated his last smoke bomb and ran—
FWOOSH!
An arrow pierced his abdomen, throwing him off balance, and his body crashed onto the muddy ground.
‘Running is impossible.’
Quickly assessing the situation, Rotmiller crawled towards the nearest tree, and pulled himself up.  At that moment…
WHOOSH!
An artificial wind swept away the smoke, and the pursuers burst forth.
“Damn it, where did he go?”
“Did we really lose him?”
“Considering the arrow, it seems likely he was hit!”
“Then he can’t have gone far. Find him…!”
The pursuers moved frantically below the tree. Rotmiller again made a calm judgment. What did he need to do to survive? Though he hadn't reached the upper levels, his long experience in the labyrinth served him well.
‘I need to treat my wounds.’
He would be discovered if the search took too long, and in his current state, capture was inevitable. So treating his wounds was priority.  But the pursuers were numerous below…
‘As quietly as possible.’
Rotmiller pulled the arrow from his abdomen.  He then placed it in his mouth like a gag.
HISS-
He poured a potion over the wound.
“…!!”
As always, the agonizing pain made him question the wisdom of treating his wounds. He suddenly felt how amazing Jandel was. He always fought through this pain. How was that even possible?
‘Ah…’
Even as he asked himself, he knew the answer. To survive.
His jaw tightened, blood rushed to his head, and his veins bulged, but Rotmiller suppressed his cry. But…
“…Huh?”
He was unlucky.  He had done everything he could, made the best judgment given the situation.  But…
“…Sh-shit! What a surprise!”
He was simply unlucky. The one who discovered him was the only pursuer taking a break, relieving himself on the ground.
FWOOSH!
Casually lifting his head while shaking off his urine, the pursuer immediately fired his crossbow; the bolt pierced his thigh.
THUD!
His battered body fell to the ground.  When he regained consciousness, he was surrounded by pursuers.
“Ha, this is the neck of a 3rd-grade essence, isn't it? What should we do, commander?”
“The capture order was revoked recently. Therefore, only the neck and identification papers should be returned.”
Their conversation was far too businesslike for a discussion about someone's life, resulting in his fate being decided instantaneously.
“Can I do it?”
“You?”
“When would someone like me ever get to take down a comrade of Jandel?”
“Do as you please.”
A man with a shifty look, assigned to his execution, slowly approached, turning a dagger.
“It'll hurt a little. This is a bit short, so I’ll need to slice.”
Rotmiller closed his eyes instead of begging. His remaining life was likely only a few dozen seconds.  All sorts of faces came to mind, faces he’d miss.  His parents, who died unable to pay taxes in his childhood. The orphanage director who raised him.  The teacher who selflessly taught him the guiding skill during his rookie explorer days…
Memories of those he was grateful to flashed through his mind.  Life had been difficult, but there had also been many joyful moments. And among them…
“I guess those were the best times.”
“Huh? What the hell is this guy saying?”
What was Hikurod doing in this chaos? Did he manage to escape?  I hope so.  His newly successful smithy was caught in the war, but his safety was paramount.  I should have visited him more often.
Regret washed over him, and other comrades came to mind. Misha Kalstain. Bjorn Jandel.  And…
‘Lionel Warb Dwarki.’
Would he greet him with a smile? Or would he yell at him for coming too early?  He couldn’t tell, but he somehow found himself smiling.
“Smiling…?”
It was inevitable. He only realized it fully as this moment truly arrived.
“Really…”
He had once thought, if such a moment ever came, he too might finally understand his friend’s feelings. It was an impossible thought.
“…What an amazing friend.”
In contrast, what about himself? Brown Rotmiller. A former explorer, too ordinary to remain with precious people, an outcast. The explorer’s end was ordinary to the very last.
“What’s with the rambling?  If you’re going to babble, let’s just get this over with.”
He wanted to live.  He didn't want to die.  He felt he had too many things left undone, too many things left to do. But…
Shhhhrink!
It was really over.
Silence.
Rotmiller closed his eyes quietly, one final face flashing before his eyes. Not his benefactor, not his beloved comrades, but someone he'd only known for a short time…
‘I should have been more honest.’
Really.  Why were there so many regrets?
“May the stars of twilight guide us…”
Like ordinary people facing death, he invoked God's name in his final moment.  And…
KABOOM!!!
A sudden explosion made him open his eyes. He didn’t know what had happened. But thankfully…
“What the hell are you doing to my guide?”
It seemed his story wasn't over yet.
