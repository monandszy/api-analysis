## The Evil Spirit's Game (Part 1)
"Cut to the chase."
"There's one more person who hasn't been asked."
What in the world was this old man talking about?  His words were all over the place.
"I'm talking about Layton Briet."
"What?"
"He wasn't asked if he was a traitor, was he?"
"You think he's... still alive?"
"Well, seeing as I witnessed his death firsthand, I doubt it. But... his death doesn't necessarily mean he was innocent."
The grim old man continued, his voice devoid of any emotion.
"No matter how many times I think about it, I arrive at the same conclusion."
"... "
"If there's a traitor amongst us, it has to be Layton Briet."
Whatever evidence he had, the old man seemed convinced that Briet was the traitor.
My thoughts were in turmoil.
"The priest wants to kill Lee Baek-ho, the warrior is the lord's pawn, the mage has his own scheme. And now the archer is a traitor? Did Lee Baek-ho really assemble this team with his feet?"
I wasn't surprised anymore. 
The front door creaked open and a woman stepped inside, causing everyone gathered in the living room to leap to their feet.
"Emily! What's the news?"
"Any solution? Have you found a way yet?"
It had been four months since Bjorn Jandel had vanished, leaving to find a way out of this cursed place.
At first, they waited, assuming he'd be back in a few days. But when a week passed with no sign of him, the situation changed.
Filled with worry, they ventured down to the basement, only to find the underground plaza empty.
It was then that they began a frantic search…
"Yurben Havellion. What about him? He's still not back either?"
With every passing day, the uncertainty grew as the whereabouts of the mage, who’d been invited by Bersil to witness the magic circle, remained unknown.
Initially, they speculated that the two had gone outside the walls. After all, they assumed they would return eventually.
But as their absence stretched on, that opinion shifted.  Bjorn and the mage had indeed ventured outside.
But something must have happened out there, something that prevented their return.
That speculation soon hardened into conviction.  
The king’s army began to occupy the once deserted basement…
"We haven't found a way to bring Bjorn back yet."
Amelia, representing the clan, had been tirelessly searching for information, but there was only one significant discovery.
The mobile magic circle in the basement had been damaged.
This information, painstakingly gathered from eavesdropping on the army commanders during a daring infiltration of their barracks, helped them piece together why Bjorn was still missing.
"I see..."
"Don't worry.  We did make some progress this time."
"... Progress?"
"The way back might be blocked, but it seems there's no problem getting out itself."
"What? Really?"
"We managed to get our hands on how to activate the magic circle.  Whether it actually works or not is up to you, Goul, you’ll have to see for yourself."
Amelia pulled a document from her bosom, seemingly from the army. Bersil took it and scanned it quickly, his eyes sharp and meticulous. Then...
"The royal family seems to know everything about this magic circle. There are detailed instructions, like a manual, on how to activate it."
"So, the verdict? Can you do it?"
"Yes.  With this, I can activate the magic circle."
Bersil responded with a confident tone. Amelia nodded in approval.
"Then that's settled."
"Settled? What do you mean?"
"Prepare for the expedition within three days."
The sudden order wasn't met with any resistance.
"Ooooh!  Are we finally doing something?!"
Ainar, who’d been dozing off, let out a cheer.
"Hmm… Since our leader's been gone for months, we have no choice but to bring him back."
Misha nodded, her expression resolute.
"Yes.  It's been such a struggle while he was off, leaving everything for me to handle. I heard that Shavin Emuer said he was going to kill or quit if our leader returned."
Bersil, burdened with the clan's affairs, let out a sigh laced with frustration.
"Putting all that aside, this is a rare opportunity, isn't it? We're going to save our leader."
Auyen, the navigator, spoke, and Erwen closed her eyes and placed her hand on her chest.
"Our leader has always been the one protecting and saving us."
The Clan Anabada’s expedition was set.
Layton Briet.  The archer of Lee Baek-ho's team, a good-natured guy with decent skills. If he was truly a traitor, there were suspicious circumstances.
He’d even been our team's guide.
[It's not a beast, but a human.]
[There's only one opponent.  Surprisingly, he seems to be asleep.]
Even if Lee Baek-ho hadn't detected the presence, Briet, given his position, could have naturally led us to Hans L...
Or rather, to the unknown person disguised as Hans L.
‘And when everyone tried to stop Baek-ho from activating the dimensional tablet, he didn't say a word…’
Once suspicion had been sown, I started to wonder if he truly was a traitor. 
Well, nothing was confirmed yet.  
A sudden rumble shook the ground.  Though I couldn’t tell the direction.
Usually, in these situations, agile characters would take charge and give a briefing. The problem was, we didn't have anyone like that around right now.
Two mages, one priest, and two tanks.
"Where is it?"
"It seemed to be over there..."
"It's too far to confirm with magic detection. It'll take a little more—."
While we were scrambling in the absence of an expert, the tremor returned. 
It was stronger than before.  This time, was it because we were on edge?
"Over there."
I could pinpoint the direction now, so I immediately led the group towards the source of the noise.
The tremor, a rhythmic thumping, grew louder as we approached.
“——Ah, speak——!!”
I could hear faint voices, barely audible even though they were nearby.  It was Lee Baek-ho’s voice, but the problem was...
"He's fighting someone, right?"
"Seems so."
It looked that way, judging by the situation.  At first, I thought maybe he was just lashing out in a fit of rage, destroying everything in sight.
"You son of a bitch! If I catch you—!"
Listening to the conversation, it was clear he was chasing someone.  I sped up, racing towards the source of the noise.
The sudden turn, a sharp corner, sent me crashing into the wall.  A blinding flash erupted, like a nuclear bomb detonated right in front of me.
My tank instincts reacted before my mind could process what was happening.
[Character has activated [Gigantification].]
I swiftly enlarged my body, blocking the narrow passage and using my shield to protect my upper body. 
But it was too late.  
A powerful, intangible shockwave slammed into me, sending heat waves across my skin.
It felt like my entire body was melting.  The parts covered by my shield, like I'd applied sunscreen, were relatively unharmed, but...
A sizzling sound crackled through the air as smoke billowed from my scorching armor.
A jolt of electricity coursed through my body, from my toes to my head.  But first, I needed to check on everyone else.
"Are you all okay?"
"I'm, I'm f-fine.  A-aah!"
What was going on? Was he seriously hurt?  As I turned to check, the grim old man’s voice cut through the air.
"Everyone's injured, but not critically."
He was one of those types who were actually helpful in these situations.  In an emergency, concise and clear information was key.
So, with that in mind...
Ignoring my worries about the rearguard, I ran forward.
The wall was chipped and scorched, but the structure itself was intact. No surprise.
After all, I'd tested it before.  Even [Star Annihilation] couldn’t destroy this structure.
There were a few weak points that could be physically damaged, but those were a small minority and not worth considering.
‘Though, what he used this time feels different.’
How many hidden trump cards does this guy have?
"Haa… haa… haa..."
After rounding another corner, I saw Lee Baek-ho, panting, standing there.
“... Baek-ho.”
He seemed to only notice us when he heard my voice, then casually replied.
"Ah, you came..."
"Tell me, what's going on here?"
"It's nothing. I was trying to catch a little rat, but he was too quick. I got a little carried away."
"A rat...?"
"But I don't know if it worked. Wanna come with me? Check if the rat got caught or not."
"Lead the way."
"Aye, aye, sir!"
He playfully led us forward, and after about a minute of following, we reached...
"How did he even survive that?"
A lone streak of blood stained the empty passage.  The blood trail continued towards the other side of the passageway...
"But I don't think he got far, huh?"
Lee Baek-ho smirked and walked slowly along the bloody path, one step, two steps, three steps...
His stride faltered about three minutes later.  
The blood trail abruptly ended, and Baek-ho stopped as well.
‘He's moving so leisurely.  Shouldn't we be rushing to find where this guy disappeared to?’
That thought made me restless, but Baek-ho just casually scanned his surroundings.
"What are you doing? We need to find—."
"Baron, do you know about this?"
I tilted my head at the question, delivered in a halting tone.  Baek-ho, as if explaining, continued.
"In our world, there's a creature called a chameleon. It's pretty amazing— it changes its skin color to match its surroundings, and it uses that to hunt."
At first, I thought he was talking nonsense, but I didn't need long to understand what he was getting at.
Baek-ho never called me ‘Baron’ in front of others, not even in private.
"And... looking at this guy, I just keep thinking about chameleons."
He finished his sentence, then punched the empty wall in front of him.  
A dull thump echoed, totally different from the sound of a fist hitting a wall.  And then...
"Kuh!"
The ‘rat,’ hidden in plain sight, was finally revealed.
"Gotcha, you little bastard."
Baek-ho looked down with a chilling smile, then grabbed the ‘rat’ by the collar and lifted him up.  
He looked like an ordinary man.  No fur or ears were visible, so he must be human as well.  His body was draped in tattered robes...
‘Wolf mask…?’
That was the most striking feature.  We'd have to find out the rest later.
"What's this?"
The man’s body sagged, seemingly unconscious.  Upon closer inspection, a dark, murky liquid trickled from his mouth.
I was startled and checked his pulse, but there was no sign of life.
"Suicide...?"
Baek-ho chuckled upon hearing my murmur, then turned his gaze towards me.  And then...
"Baron."
He addressed me using that title, which he reserved for when no one else could hear.
"No matter what world you go to, small animals always have something in common, you know?"
I thought I knew what was coming next, but Baek-ho didn’t give me a chance to answer.
"They play dead when they’re in trouble."
"...?"
"Just like this."
He finished his sentence, then punched the body in the abdomen.
"Kuhk-!!"
The wolf mask crouched on the floor, writhing like an insect.  Baek-ho stretched out his hand towards the cowering figure.
"Let's have a look at your face."
Time to remove the mask.
Baek-ho’s touch was far from gentle or caring.  
He spread his hand, grabbed the mask, and then, ignoring the various locking mechanisms designed to keep it secure, ripped it off with brutal force.  And then...
"... "
The face behind the mask was finally revealed.  A silence descended, broken only by Baek-ho's voice.
"Wow, you were really alive?"
