## Giant Step (1)
The man, his face obscured by a stag-horn mask, rushed out of the assembly room as soon as it was open. He made his way to the chamber where the round table lay, his steps hurried. 
Unlike usual, the table was completely empty.
“First to arrive, it seems.”
He scanned the room before choosing a seat, four spots to the left of where the Lion always sat.  With the round table no longer filled to capacity, everyone now left an empty space between them.
Assuming all seven members were present, this guaranteed him the second spot.
“The first spot is always a bit of a pain, though…”, he mused. The first person’s information determined the quality of the entire round.
“And besides, that one sits right next to me…”, he thought, deciding the second spot was the best choice. The third or fourth weren’t bad, but they’d put him face to face with the one. 
The later spots felt too heavy, though the Clown, always hungry for attention, often took the last one. 
“He’s just that kind of person, I guess.”
He didn’t know it, but this spot was, unbeknownst to him, the most coveted among the members.
Was it because of this?
“Oh! Stag-horn? You made it this time!”
As the Goblin mask entered the chamber, he greeted him, scanned the room, and took a seat one space away, directly to his right.
“Mind if I sit here?”
It would make him the third speaker once the assembly commenced.
“Were you busy last time?”
The Goblin, settling in, asked, but Stag-horn only offered a vague reply.
“Personal reasons.”
“Really?”
Perhaps it was a mere icebreaker, as he didn’t seem bothered by Stag-horn’s brief response. 
Stag-horn cautiously inquired, “Was there anything…?”
“…What?”
“From last time, I mean.  I was curious if there was a major event while I was gone.”
His voice was far too subservient, almost apologetic, for someone addressing a Goblin.
It was a breach of decorum, after all. It was an unwritten rule that details of previous assemblies were never disclosed to absent members. 
But…
“He might tell me if it’s the Goblin.”
Why else would he rush in like this? He wanted to break the ice with someone, to get some information before the others arrived.
And the Goblin was the first to show up!
What luck—
Thud.
A sound came from the entrance. Another member had arrived after the Goblin.
“The Fox, of all people.” 
If she was involved, there was a high chance the Fox would prevent the Goblin from answering his question.
He sighed as he thought about it.
“I overheard, unintentionally.”
“…”
“Don’t worry, nothing big happened.  Or rather, nothing could have happened, could it?”
“What do you mean?”
“The Lion was absent last time.”
“The Lion was absent…?”
“Yes, which meant the Clown and the Queen just came in and left. Without them, things naturally wrapped up.”
“Oh…”
“Now that you’re satisfied, don’t do that again. The moment one person breaks the rule, it’s no longer a rule.” 
Her voice, though pleasant, carried a hint of unease.
“I’ll be more careful.”
The Fox’s gaze shifted to the Goblin as Stag-horn readily agreed. 
“Goblin, you too.”
“Huh? Why me?”
“Don’t answer everything you’re asked. Or rather, be careful what you say.”
“Ha! Fox, you’re really something… Be careful what I say… Yes, careful what I say… Haha!”
The Goblin laughed awkwardly as the Fox scanned the empty seats, settling into the fourth spot.
“So… that makes Crescent Moon the first speaker, right?”
“If she shows up, of course. She didn’t seem keen on the later seats.”
“Hmm, but the Lion won’t be absent again, right?”
“Who knows? We’ll find out.”
“Ha, haha. Right…”, he mumbled, watching the Fox and the Goblin comfortably engage in conversation.  
He felt a strange dissonance. The Fox seemed at ease with the Goblin, while the Goblin looked uncomfortable around her. 
Stag-horn didn’t dwell on the issue. He had more important things to consider. 
“The Lion being absent…”, he mused.  It was a blessing in disguise. He was disappointed to miss the assembly due to his urgent matters, but even if he’d been there, it wouldn’t have made much difference.
He felt he’d at least avoided a loss.
But one thing still bothered him.
[The Lion is Bjorn Yandel.]
The Queen had said those words in front of the jewel, long ago.  While the red light had extinguished it, it had been a hot topic around the round table for a time.
There were too many similarities, after all.
Between the Lion and Bjorn Yandel.
“Nah, it’s probably just a coincidence. They’re too different to be the same person.”
Bjorn Yandel was only a fourth-year explorer now. 
The Lion had joined the community about 20 years ago.
There was no way they could be the same person.
But…
“What’s with this feeling? Like I’m missing something…”
Stag-horn glanced at the Goblin, still engrossed in conversation with the Fox.
“Any idea when Crescent Moon will be here? I think the Clown and the Queen will come in at the end like usual.”
“They’ll show up when they’re ready.  But… Goblin, why do you address only the Queen with ‘Nim’?”
“Haha… Did I?”
He’d been the one, after all.
The one who had first voiced the suspicion.
That Bjorn Yandel and the Lion might be the same person.
His reasoning had been the fact that Bjorn’s death had coincided with the Lion’s absence, but at the time, he’d been met with mockery.
“I just… feel obligated to be respectful.  She… she is a Queen, after all.”
He chimed in, interrupting their conversation.
“Hey, Goblin.”
“…”
“You still think Bjorn Yandel might be the Lion?”
“Uh… why the sudden question?”
“Just curious, you know.”
“Hmm…”
The Goblin looked confused, but he answered anyway.
“No. I don’t think so.”
His answer was clear and concise. 
Stag-horn was immediately convinced.
“Really?  Well, I guess it would be impossible for someone summoned 22 years ago to be the same person.”
“Huh? Oh, yeah… That makes sense, I guess.”
The ambiguous response made Stag-horn frown.
“…Hmm?  Is there another reason, then?”
“Well… I don’t think Bjorn Yandel is an Evil Spirit.”
“Ah, that’s it.”
Bjorn Yandel being an Evil Spirit was the Royal Family’s strategic announcement, and the news that it wasn’t true had spread across the continent.
So this reaction made sense—
“No.  It’s a bit different from that.”
What? This isn’t it either?
As Stag-horn waited for an explanation, the Goblin looked at the Fox nervously before finally speaking. 
“I can’t explain it in detail…  But Bjorn Yandel isn’t an Evil Spirit. He can’t be. Yes, that much is certain.”
The Goblin then shut his mouth, as if to say he wouldn’t answer any further questions, and Stag-horn didn’t press him.
“…Now that I think about it, Sven Parab was also on that expedition.”
Maybe he had felt something during their time together. Evil Spirits were quite adept at recognizing others like them.
He couldn’t dismiss the judgement of someone who had lived side-by-side with them in the Labyrinth.
“So… Bjorn Yandel really isn’t an Evil Spirit.”
Stag-horn didn’t dwell on the issue any further. The feeling that he was on the verge of discovering something had vanished long ago, and besides…
“You’re all here early.”
Crescent Moon, the fourth to arrive, took the first speaker’s seat. The remaining members began to arrive. 
“Good to see you all today.”
The Queen arrived next, taking her customary fifth seat.
And then…
“Pish.”
The Clown arrived.
Everyone except one had taken their place, and the remaining members’ gazes naturally shifted to the single empty seat.
The situation was ludicrous, if you thought about it.
What were these people doing?  Gathering together, leaving the most important seat empty, and eagerly waiting for one person’s arrival?
“Oh, I really hope he’s here today.”
The Clown’s plea was answered, as if by a whisper from the gods, by the sound coming from the hallway.
Thud.
A soft sound of footsteps. 
The moment he heard it, Stag-horn couldn’t help but tense his shoulders.
It was an odd sensation.
Thud.
Just the sound of someone walking, nothing special. He couldn’t even see the figure yet.
But why was it so intimidating?
Did he use some kind of intimidation skill? He knew better than anyone that wasn’t the case.
Thud.
Yes, the footsteps were ordinary. Anyone could walk like that. 
But why did everyone shut their mouths the moment they heard it? 
Thud.
It was simply because they knew.
Even if the sound was ordinary.
Thud.
The owner of the footsteps was not.
Thud.
The sound of footsteps came once more, and finally, he arrived.
“Pish, you’ve—”.
The Clown, as if a loyal servant, stood to greet him. But he didn’t even glance at him, instead moving directly towards the empty seat.
And then…
“…”
He sat down, his chin resting in his hand, saying nothing.
“…I’ll have to be careful today.”
He swallowed involuntarily.
He didn’t think he was being ridiculous.
He knew he wasn’t the only one feeling this way.
“…”
“…”
The atmosphere felt heavy.
***
It was a quietness that made me crave a nap, to just flop back and sleep.
“Ugh, I’m so sleepy…”
I propped my chin on my hand, trying to suppress a yawn that kept wanting to escape.
Ugh, should’ve just skipped today. I’m more than just tired, I could fall asleep if I close my eyes.
“And why is it so quiet here?”
I didn’t want to talk, so I just waited for things to move along, but the silence continued.
“…”
“…”
What is everyone doing? I thought someone would immediately ask where I’d been. 
I finally spoke up, unable to bear it any longer. 
“How long are we—?”
“…”
“Going to sit here like this?”
“!!”
I just wanted things to start so I could go to sleep, that’s all.
The Goblin quickly responded to my roundabout way of expressing my impatience.
“Y, yes! We, we should start! Th, th, then… Crescent Moon, please… begin…  I think…”, he stuttered, clearly nervous. 
I thought the Fox would take the lead, but it was him?  He was so nervous, his speech was coming out in a jumble, but thanks to him, everyone’s gaze shifted to Crescent Moon, the first speaker.
“…I should’ve picked a different seat.”
She sighed, clearly burdened by being first, then announced the start of the assembly.
“I’ll go first.”
The information he shared concerned the Fairy race. Or rather, I should say it was about Erwen.
He got a green light for revealing that the Blood-Moon Princess had hinted at leaving the Pureblood Corps.
The Pureblood Corps is like a special unit for the Fairy race, by the way. Erwen had taken a leave of absence and was away for a bit. She’d said she’d put in her resignation recently.
Thud, thud.
So, the first one was already known information.
“…The expedition led by Bjorn Yandel was assembled with the understanding that they’d all be sacrificed.”
The Stag-horn, the second speaker, revealed that the expedition was a sacrificial lamb.  It got a red light.
After all, the Fox, Goblin, and I already knew that.
In the end, Stag-horn was flustered and tried again, but…
“…The Royal Family offered Bjorn Yandel a promotion for his efforts on this expedition.”
It was green, but there was no feedback. 
Usually, someone would chime in with, “So, a Viscount, not a Baron?  He could even pass on his title to his children!”, but no one said anything.
Come to think of it, it was like that with Crescent Moon too.
“Everyone’s unusually quiet today.”
Actually, the expedition story is our secret, but for the others, it was a shocking revelation.
Their reaction was a little strange, but it wasn’t a big deal.
I was too tired to even care.
Thud, thud.
So, the second piece of information was a bust?
“I should’ve told the Fox and the Goblin. If I had, it would’ve been another red light.”
I licked my lips in disappointment.
Then it was the Goblin’s turn, the third speaker. He trembled as he spoke, keeping it brief.
I thought he’d talk about the expedition, but he didn’t. Was it because of the Fox’s “careful what you say”?  Hmm, I think he could’ve shared some helpful information, but I guess he wasn’t interested in sharing details of something as boring as the inner workings of the Church…
It’s a Goblin thing. He sometimes shares important information, but the quality of what he usually reveals is low.
It got green, though, so it was on to the next turn.
“So, the third one was a bust too.”
Something felt off today.  Usually, even if it got green, someone would challenge the information and push for something different. Why is everyone just sitting here?
Thud, thud.
I don’t want to step up, so let’s just move on. The Goblin is basically an ally now.
“Next up is the Fox.”
I wasn’t really expecting much from her either.  She’s basically the same as the Goblin in that she was in the Labyrinth with me the whole time.
“….Big clans are planning a group boycott. They’re upset the Royal Family organized an expedition without even informing them, assigning them special missions.”
This is something that was reported to me while I was in the city. 
She was kicked out of her clan after my time as a vegetable, but because she was a vice-captain for so long, she’s got a wide network and is good at collecting information.
Now I have access to her network.
“The fourth piece of information was useless too.”
I hope the next one is different.
Thud, thud.
I shifted my gaze to the Queen, the next speaker. Our eyes met for a moment.
Was my gaze too intense?
She quickly averted her gaze, looking startled, then spoke with an unusually unsure voice. 
“…The GM unbanned… that… Baekho from the community.”
It’s obvious the GM made him do it. An attempt to show me he granted my request.
Ugh, give me some information instead of this useless gesture.
Thud, thud.
It would’ve been green for everyone except me, though, so it was on to the next.
“…It’s already my turn, pish.”
Everyone’s been so focused on information, without any small talk. The pace is much faster than usual.
Ugh, right. This guy is always the wildcard.
Even though I was tired to death, I stayed alert, keeping my ears open. 
But…
“You all know Dragon Slayer Regal Bagos is dead…”
He started off casually, testing the waters, but ultimately, the information he revealed was disappointing. 
“Bjorn Yandel, they said he was sent by the Royal Family as a spy, pretending to be one of us. It’s all a lie.”
This is not only unhelpful, it’s a pain.
“Ugh, I’ll have to explain all this to the Fox and the Goblin later. They believed it.”
Anyway, the Clown’s info was easily green, regardless of how I felt about it. 
Finally, it was my turn.
“…”
“…”
Gazes turned towards me one by one.
It was the usual pattern whenever it was my turn. A silent rule of this round table ever since I arrived: I bring in entertaining stories, and in return, I offer them information.
So, what about this time?
Was it actually interesting enough for me to listen to?
Thud.
My answer was simple.
I placed my hand on the jewel and began.
My response would’ve been much more polished, filtered, if it were any other day. 
“Everything you’ve said, so far…”, I said, honestly, because it was starting to get annoying.
“Is complete trash.”
Not a concept, but the truth.
Hell, I held back yawns the entire time.
“I might as well have just gone to sleep. It would’ve been more rewarding.”
The moment I removed my hand from the jewel, the light came on.
Wwwwwhhhhooooosh-
This was strange.
“You guys really didn’t know?”
“…”
“I guess this green light confirms it.”
It was boring enough to make me want to sleep.
