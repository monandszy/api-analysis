The Shifting Fates (Part 6)
The choice lay before me: Sector 7 or the Sanctuary.  Honestly, neither option felt palatable.  A life hung in the balance with each decision.  Sector 7 meant A’s death; the Sanctuary, B’s. I didn't know their identities, but both A and B were undoubtedly invaluable comrades.  Yet…
“That’s the choice that best serves the Lion,” the infernal old man advised through the wolf.  Letting A die and saving B would benefit me, he’d explained, urging me towards Sector 7. He’d even woven his explanation into a metaphor about a rigged card game, a dubious attempt at persuasion…
The weight of the decision pressed on me, and finally, I made my choice.  I opted for the Sanctuary, my original destination.  My reasoning wasn't complex.  While I agreed that a shifted fate is still fate, I didn’t trust Auril Gaviss’s judgment.  If I had to lose someone regardless of my path, I'd choose my own way.  Even if I regretted it later, at least it would be my choice, not someone else's.
‘That old coot still doesn't know me.’  He should have recognized my rebellious nature before offering such advice.
‘…What?’
Had he anticipated my choice? The thought crossed my mind, but I dismissed it. I'd always planned to go to the Sanctuary; his meddling seemed unnecessary.
‘Enough. Let's not overthink this.’
Dwelling on it only bred more doubt, so I cleared my mind and focused solely on reaching my destination.
Ten minutes, twenty minutes, thirty minutes…  How much time had passed?
A series of deafening explosions echoed in the distance. A powerful tremor shook the very walls I was running along. What in the world was happening?
I increased my speed, soon reaching the city walls bordering the Sanctuary's outer perimeter.  Still some distance from the gate, I prepared to continue my journey when…
“…Huh?”
I saw it. Purely by chance.  Even with the dense foliage obscuring my view from below.
“…Rothmiller?”
My first guide knelt before a tree stump, a horrific sight.
Just then, a thug approached Rothmiller, brandishing a knife.  Without hesitation, I leaped from the wall.
The earth trembled violently upon my landing, as if I'd used a powerful leap skill.  The thugs surrounding Rothmiller's widened their eyes in terror.
“What do you think you're doing to my guide?”
Rothmiller stared at me as if he’d seen a ghost. Then, I understood.
“…Yandel?”
A was Rothmiller.
***
The situation resolved quickly. With each swing of my hammer, a thug’s skull exploded. The battle was over, though many escaped like cockroaches. Still, the fighting was finished.
“Are you alright, Rothmiller?”
“Ah…”
Rothmiller remained dazed, but regained consciousness after I applied a potion to his wounds.
“I see you’re not quite right.”
A hiss, then a scream of pain.
The potion revitalized Rothmiller, almost too much so; it took time for his energy to settle.
“Yandel…”
“You're coming to now.”
“…Thanks to you, I live.”
“How’s your body? I have plenty of potions.”
“…I’m fine. All healed.”
Right then.
“Yandel, how did you get here…?”
Oh, that?  I could explain, but it would take too long.
“We'll talk later.  Tell me what's going on.”
Rothmiller seemed to agree that curiosity could wait.  He gave a concise briefing:  “The Noirks broke the barrier and attacked.  We were vastly outnumbered and retreated.  Our elite forces used the widened front lines to target the Noirks’ leaders.”
“But whether their plan succeeded or failed, I don't know… We should go help them…”
I hoisted Rothmiller onto my back.
“…What?”  He didn't understand.
“Why are you carrying me? Leave me. I'd only be a hindrance.”
He was right. He remained the same, but I had changed drastically since our “half-baked team” days.  I'd be more hindrance than help.  But…
“You're my guide, aren't you?”
Leaving him alone felt wrong. I wasn’t even sure if saving him once was enough. So…
“You’ll tell me where we need to go.”
I said it playfully.  Rothmiller stiffened, then chuckled.
“…You haven’t changed a bit.”
“They say people die when they change. I intend to live a long time.”
“…I don't know how their plan went, but let's go to the gate.”
We ran towards the gate, encountering countless Noirks along the way.  They didn't impede us, though. They rolled out of our path, apparently fearing my tank-like charge. Their sudden friendliness before a superior force was nothing new.  Soon, we reached the gate, a scene of carnage.
‘So many dead…’
Corpses littered the area – Noirks and our own men, mostly Barbarian warriors.  I recognized some of the fallen – the guy who bought a house first in the property lottery; the guy who whined about unfair equipment upgrades at the coming-of-age ceremony; the guy who asked me to name his son, hoping for a strong warrior.
My jaw clenched, but I scanned the surroundings.
The Noirks flinched and backed away whenever our eyes met.
‘Unimportant. Let's move on.’
Two things mattered: the gate’s former location, now blocked by a collapsed section of the wall, severing the connection between the Sanctuary and Sector 7; and…
“Hey, isn’t that Yandel?”
“It’s him! It’s Mr. Yandel!”
My comrades peered down from the walls. I counted them: Einar, Vercil, Misha, Erwin, James Cala… everyone except Amelia, Auyen, Parav, and Marone.
“Mr. Yandel!!!”
Erwin gracefully leaped from the high wall.  Instinctively, I caught her.
“Where have you been?! We were so worried!!”
“Later.  Tell me the situation.”
The Noirks were numerous but didn't approach; my reputation kept them at bay.
“Rothmiller said they were targeting the Noirk command. Did they succeed?”
“No.” Erwin explained the near-success: they hadn't captured the command, but they had managed to collapse the wall, leaving the Noirks' elite forces outside and preventing reinforcements from entering the Sanctuary.
“Now we’re holding the walls, preventing enemy reinforcements!”
Ah, that's why they were on the wall. Had I not found Rothmiller, I would have met them there too.
“So, Ms. Goulond…”
Perhaps it was the reunion.  Erwin, chattering enthusiastically about the war, was cut short by my smirk.
“Next plan is obvious.”
“…What?”
It was simple. Holding the wall prevented enemy numbers from increasing within the Sanctuary. Meaning the Noirks already inside were isolated.  There was only one thing to do.
“Let’s wipe them out.”
“…Ah! You’re so smart!”
I ignored Erwin's mindless praise, scanning the area again.  More Noirks were gathering at the gate, either alerted to the wall’s collapse or by my arrival.
Counting them was pointless.  To kill them all with my hammer would take forever. So…
“Erwin, prepare.”
“…Yes?”
“It's time for ‘that’ again.”
“…Ah, that…?”
Understanding my unspoken command, Erwin activated her skill.
“Erwin Fornaci di Tercia has cast [Spirit Transformation].”
There was no need to specify the attribute.
“The wind spirit descends upon the character.”
“Evasion is enhanced against all damage.”
“Magical damage taken is doubled.”
“A strong bonus is applied to piercing and cutting attacks.”
“Agility significantly increased…”
It was perfect for a slaughter.
“All attack ranges are tripled.”
“The character has cast [Swing].”
Her hammer elongated and grew, a fearsome weapon.
A roar shook the battlefield, yet my mind raced.
“Run…!”
“How are we supposed to fight that…?”
A was Rothmiller. And he survived because I went to the Sanctuary.  Then…
…who is B?
