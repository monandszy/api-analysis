## The Barbarian Revolution (4)
The memory of my first awakening in this world is the most vivid of them all. I was confused by the unfamiliar language that I somehow understood, yet struggled to comprehend the situation. A sense of déjà vu washed over me. This felt like the beginning of [Dungeon & Stone].
“Someone died there…”
I even remembered his name.
Orem, the son of Cadua.
He’d gone through countless trials before entering this world. But within five minutes of his arrival, his head was severed.
And…
“There were many like him.”
After becoming tribe leader, I looked through past records. Over the last ten years, an average of one player was executed during the coming-of-age ceremony each year. Lately, the popularity of the cheat version had waned, so the number had been steadily decreasing.
“I guess there are still a few who still play…”
It's a pitiful sight.
"Tsk, how could they get sucked into such a game…"
Of course, I don’t mean to blame them.  The responsibility lies with one person only.
“That damned old bastard.”
Auril Gaviss.
The creator of [Dungeon & Stone]…
“You have reached the abyss.”
“Tutorial Complete.”
He’s the one who kidnapped countless players after showing them only these messages.
"If he wanted us to do a tutorial, he should have done it properly."
Seeing the terrified faces of these new recruits, I was flooded with memories of the past.
My flashback was fleeting. I had to continue the ceremony before the other warriors noticed me. 
“Quiet everyone!”
At my command, the baby barbarians quieted down and I continued the coming-of-age ceremony. It wasn’t done the old way, though.
This was a much smoother way to offer help. There might be other new recruits hiding somewhere.
“Macal, the second son of Putil!”
I walked up to the young warrior, called his name, and patted him on the shoulder.
“Come forth and choose your weapon.”
“Yes sir!!!”
The young warrior yelled, moved by the tribe leader’s warm encouragement and support. 
“A double-handed axe! Excellent choice!”
I continued to call out each warrior’s name, offering encouragement and subtly hinting at the current situation.
"From this day forth, you are a warrior. May the blessings of ‘Lapdonia’ be with you!"
Time seemed to slip by. Finally, it was the turn of the newbie I'd been watching.
“Bectha, the third son of Kiltau!”
My hand landed on his shoulder, and his trembling was unmistakable. But I pretended not to notice and spoke.
“Come forth and choose the weapon that will begin your journey.”
“…Yes sir!!”
Compared to the other warriors, his timing was off, and his voice was soft. But…
“He’s got some sense though.”
Seeing him try to imitate the other warriors, I thought he’d probably survive. 
‘Huh?’
Then, as I saw the weapon he chose, I chuckled.
“A shield…?”
I muttered under my breath, and he flinched as if he’d done something wrong.
‘I never thought a shield-wielding barbarian newbie would be around.’
I walked past the stiff Bectha and approached the display where the shields were hung. I took the item he had left behind and handed it to him.
“Take this.”
I’d used my tribe leader's authority to implement a patch that gave new recruits a small one-handed hammer along with a shield.
“Bectha, the third son of Kiltau! You are now a warrior!”
After a moment of being thrown off by this unexpected situation, Bectha took the hammer, then returned to his original position. He tried to act unconcerned, but his expression was full of anxiety.
‘He needs time to process everything, I guess.’
I ignored the newbie and continued the ceremony, and soon the last warrior had chosen his weapon.
“Warriors!”
I gave a short speech before they headed to the city. A review, really.
"Finally, let's all chant together. What is a good looter?"
“Only a dead looter!!!”
"What about the Explorer’s Guild?"
“Don’t trust them!!”
"What do you do if you meet Hans in the labyrinth?”
“Don’t! Get away! If you don’t want to die!”
The reason I drilled these chants into these young warriors was simple.
You can never review too much.
And besides, there are newbies among them.
"Now then…"
I had one final piece of information to impart.
"What do you do if you encounter an ‘evil spirit’ that has taken over our bodies?”
This, perhaps, was the most important information for their survival.
“Kill them!!”
If they are discovered to be players, they die.
***
“Open the gates!”
My roar echoed, and the gate that separated the holy ground from the city opened.
The young warriors, who’d spent their lives dreaming of this day, started trembling with excitement.
“Lapdonia…!”
Normally, at this moment, I’d tell them to set forth to their fate.  However, I led the young warriors into the city myself.
“……What? The tribe leader is going to act as a guide?”
It’s not like we have much choice.
I have to enter the labyrinth too.
“Behel—laaaAAAAAAA!”
“We will all become great warriors!!!”
The warriors were overwhelmed with emotion that the tribe leader was acting as their guide.  I admired their innocence, but I quickly led them to the heart of the city.
And…
“Greetings, Baron Yandel.”
I met with the Guild’s wizard at the agreed-upon location and received the ‘Binding’ spell.
It wasn't for me, but for the young warriors.
While I was binding them in groups of three or four, a few warriors asked me a question.
“…Tribe leader! I heard that the first expedition is supposed to be done with our own strength…?”
“Yes! I heard it’s tradition from when I was young!”
Tradition, my ass.
So many warriors have died because of that goddamned tradition, trying to find a buddy for their first expedition in the dead of night.
A wave of anger surged through me, but…
"You fools!!!"
Someone spoke before I could. It was Ainar, our Barbarian tribe’s first elder.
"Bjorn, Yandel’s son, is the tribe leader!"
"But even if he’s the tribe leader, tradition is—."
"From today, everything the tribe leader says is tradition! So you better follow, no matter what!"
It might have been a bit dictatorial, but it was persuasive.  After all, our tribe has a system for appropriate objections.
“If you don't like the new tradition, then you can change it when you become the tribe leader one day! Got it?”
In other words, if you don’t like it, come and fight me for it.
Luckily, the warriors, raised in the natural order, readily accepted the logic.
“…I understand.”
Okay, so that’s settled.
“Um…the fee…?”
“Here you go.”
After the binding was complete, I paid the Guild wizard.
“Good work today. See you next month.”
“Oh…yes, Baron…?”
The wizard, who’d had to work overtime and go on a business trip, left with a sour face after hearing my words about next month. 
But, I will see him again next month. 
If I go to the Guild Branch leader and ask ‘favor’, what can a mere wizard do? 
"The labyrinth!!"
"Oh, oh oh! That’s the…!!!”
“It feels as if an unknown force is pulling me towards it!”
Anyway, after paying the fee, I once again led the warriors to the Dimensional Plaza.
That’s the end of the tribe leader’s duty.
There was no need for further explanation.
"Go, warriors!"
The young warriors, as soon as I gave the order, shoved their way through the crowd toward the portal.
“WooooOooooO!”
Ainar chuckled as she watched them go.
"Bjorn, what’s with the worried face?”
It’s because they’re like kids in a pool.
The stronger our tribe becomes, the more of them must return alive...
"Don’t worry.  We had a tougher environment, yet those who survived, came back, didn't they?”
A Barbarian-style consolation peppered with some old-school anecdotes.
Surprisingly, it made me feel a bit better.
The truth is that the Barbarian tribe’s training was just too hardcore.  I don’t want to raise them like hothouse flowers, either.
Ultimately, crises are the best things for people’s growth.
The lessons learned from crises are etched into our bones, hard to forget, even if we want to.
"Mister!!"
After sending the warriors into the labyrinth, I reunited with my teammates, walking around the Dimensional Plaza.
"You’re late.”
Amelia said, looking at her watch, and Auyen Rockrobe, the navigator, greeted me with a nervous expression.
“You’ve arrived! Clan leader!”
He was fully equipped, for a change.
"Thank you so much for letting me come along!"
His voice was sincere.
Well, he’d been stuck in a basement for days.
But was it because he tried to loot me? 
I didn’t feel a shred of sympathy.
I repeat, only a dead looter is a good looter.  And it’s impossible to trust someone like him unless they’re disciplined.
“Emily.”
“Don’t worry. I’ll keep a close eye on him while we’re in the labyrinth.”
It was an open conversation in front of Auyen, but he pretended not to hear anything.  He didn’t beg for trust or promise he’d do well.
‘He’s definitely got a knack for reading the room.’
Should I be happy or sad about this…?
“Uh, Bjorn? Don’t we have to go now?”
"Oh...right.”
The dazzling portal was slowly shrinking, so we headed towards it.  And…
“You have entered the Crystal Cave on the first floor.”
The first expedition of the Anabada Clan had begun.
***
The Crystal Cave, glowing with a violet light.
“North.”
“North, it is.”
“It’s towards the Goblin Forest, isn’t it?”
Three people spoke at the same time. 
It was me, a student of Rotmiller, Amelia, the guide, and Erwen, who had been trained by her sister. 
“…….”
“…….”
A funny situation arose from having three guides on a team of only five.
“Ahem.”
“I was faster. Than her.”
“…….”
“Ha ha! You guys are kids? Competing over something like that!”
Ainar burst out laughing, and Erwen glared at her, unable to hide her displeasure.  But it didn’t work.
"Good glare, Erwen!"
Ainar nodded, as if she liked it.
“……?”
Erwen furrowed her brow, as if she had encountered a creature she couldn’t understand, and Ainar shrugged.
"It means she looks happy! Unlike last time!"
I flinched at her words.
Last time... it meant the day I heard it from Raven.
Ainar had stepped on a landmine.
But…
“……What are you talking about.”
Erwen, surprisingly, didn’t get angry.  She just avoided eye contact, as if she was embarrassed.
‘Right, she’s actually pretty weak when it comes to stuff like this….’
It’s a good thing Ainar came.
To be honest, I felt a little overwhelmed, with Amelia trying to take care of Erwen on her own.
‘She seems to be a lot nicer these days….’
As I was having these thoughts, Amelia said, “Alright, let’s go! Bjorn’s back, so I’ve been too excited to calm down!”
Ainar stepped forward, and I chuckled, stopping her.
"Ainar, where are you going?”
“Huh?  We started from the north, so we're going north!  I know the basics now!  I can read a compass too!”
It’s great to see her growth over the past few years, but…
“We’re not going to the Goblin Forest today.”
Amelia cut in, and Ainar tilted her head.
“…Oh? Is that so?  Where are we going then? The Land of the Dead?”
"It’s the Rock Desert.  Hmm, strange. I clearly shared the expedition plan before—"
“Oh, sorry! I forgot!”
“……I see.”
Amelia was speechless, having never dealt with a true Barbarian before, and I quickly cleared the situation.  We couldn’t waste time here any longer.
“Well then…”
Who should I let act as the guide?
Should it be Amelia, the guide, like last time? Or should I let Erwen try this time?
I hesitated for a moment, but my decision was quick.
“…I’ll guide you.”
Today’s main goal was teamwork.
It’s best to minimize any chance of hurt feelings, no matter who it is. 
"What? You don’t have to, Mister—"
"What are you saying? We share the burden of this kind of boring stuff.  Come on, hurry up and follow me."
I cut off Erwen and immediately stepped forward. I had a lot to do on this expedition.
Ainar, thankfully, didn’t remember anything…
‘So she doesn’t suspect anything, no matter what I do.’
It’s actually an advantage.
With Raven on the old team, I couldn’t even use my knowledge of the game properly because I was always worried about what she thought.
“You have entered the Rock Desert on the second floor.”
Well then, let’s try out our teamwork.
Let’s start with the lower raids, slowly.
