## Chapter 570: Closed Gates (4)
A strange world where the fact that I'm an Evil Spirit must remain hidden. This world, where players could communicate anonymously through the Ghostbusters, was about to shut down. 
The announcement caused a stir.
"Don't close the gates."
"Open the gates. Open the gates. Open the gates. Open the gates. Open the gates. Open the gates. Open the gates. Open the gates. Open the gates. Open the gates."
A post demanding with no logic.
"GM, if you're going to shut down the server, then do it. Do it already."
It’s not a big deal if you die.
A post threatening, putting their own lives on the line.
"Please, GM and administrators, take a look at this."
Hello. I'm a simple person who has been stuck in this world for five years now. Just like everyone else, I’ve faced my fair share of near-death experiences. And some of them were my own fault.
I wanted to give up on everything and just rest. 
But, it was this Ghostbusters community that...
A post begging with heartfelt pleading to reconsider shutting down the server.
"GP refund application."
I just did it. When will it be processed?
It's a lot of money for me. You won't scam me, right?
A post worried about their own losses rather than the community.
"A 12-year veteran's speculation on the reasons for the closure of Ghostbusters."
As everyone knows, the GM and the Royal Family have a secret connection. The community was able to exist in the first place because the Royal Family looked the other way...
A post filled with analysis and speculation, and so on. 
From the first post, the entire board was filled with discussions and arguments, all revolving around the "Ghostbusters closure" incident.
It was an understandable reaction.
Click, click.
I was also deeply shocked and kept reading the related posts, my mind filled with one question: "Why the hell are they shutting down the server?"
I eventually stopped scrolling. 
There wasn’t any useful information to be found. 90% of it was inflammatory nonsense or pointless ranting.
Right, so I'll think about it myself.
I probably know more than those guys, anyway.
"It has to be... something related to the Royal Family."
It was pretty much a given. 
The secret relationship between the GM and the Royal Family has already been proven.
The problem, however, is...
“Why would the Royal Family suddenly want to close the server?”
Their motive isn’t clear.
Just a simple conflict between the GM and the Royal Family?
That possibility exists, but maybe there's a political motivation involved.
"Ugh... this is getting complicated."
The closure of the community itself is sad news, but what makes it even more frustrating is the timing.
“Why now of all times, while I’m trapped on the 1st floor...?"
If the community disappears, I'll be completely cut off from any news from the outside world.
In simpler terms, I'll lose the ability to influence events outside the dungeon, depending on the situation.
Click, click. 
I finished pondering the circumstances surrounding the community's closure and moved my mouse.
"I'll just ask them."
After a hundred and a thousand thoughts, I decided that talking to the person involved was the best option.
I'm different from those regular users who can only post whining messages on the board.
I know the GM's nickname.
"Requesting a 1:1 chat with Elfnunalove."
That nickname always makes me feel uneasy whenever I see it.
I sent a chat request anyway.
But…
"Are they busy?"
Silence greeted me, no matter how long I waited.
No refusal, no message saying to wait a little longer.
Ugh, fine, I’ll just keep waiting…
Click, click.
I clicked the chatroom category again.
"[Independent Korea Forever]" - 2 users online.
Okay, it seems both of them are online.
“Huu…”
I placed the cursor over the "Enter chatroom" button and took a deep breath, calming myself.
Then…
“Oh! Hyung-nimmm!! You’re here!! This lowly little brother is here to greet you with all his might!!”
“Oppa, did you see the notice? I was just about to talk about—.”
As soon as I entered the chatroom, I glared at Baek-ho and said, 
Sorry, Hyun-byeol, but…
"Hyun-byeol, can you give us a moment?"
“….Yes?”
"Baek-ho, I need to talk to this little bastard."
I didn't come here to laugh and have fun today.
***
Hyun-byeol left the chatroom silently, glancing at me warily.
Baek-ho cautiously opened his mouth in the silence.
"Hyung... are you angry...?"
It was truly a disgusting sight.
As if he didn't care whether I was angry or not. If he had been that kind of guy, he wouldn't have tried to pull these shady tricks in the first place. 
Therefore.
"Hey, what the hell are you doing, you little bastard?"
I asked my honest question directly.
Did he not understand?
"What? No, Hyung... calm down... You have to tell me why you’re doing this first..."
Right, he wants to know how much I know. 
Well, there's no point in hiding anything now.
If this is the real end for the community, I won’t have another chance to talk to him in a better environment.
“Revival Stone.”
I uttered a single word, just like I did to Misha.
Did that alone give him a glimpse of the situation?
“Ah.”
Baek-ho’s expression shifted instantaneously.
From the anxious look he had when I was angry to a look that seemed to be filled with regret.
“I guess it failed.”
He sighed briefly and asked me, 
“Did she tell you?”
It was truly shocking to realize this at this moment.
This bastard is truly broken somewhere inside.
“Or did you just find out? Well, I guess I should have known better than to trust you in the first place...”
"Baek-ho."
I cut him off.
I felt like I wouldn't be able to control my emotions if I kept listening.
With a clenched jaw, I asked as calmly as possible,
"Why did you do it?"
Why did you give Misha the Revival Stone? 
Baek-ho tilted his head at my short question.
Then…
“That’s not like you, Hyung.”
He chuckled and looked at me.
“Don’t you already know the answer, Hyung?”
He was right, of course.
But…
“Just answer the question. Why did you do it?”
I asked again, pressing him. Baek-ho finally gave his answer.
“Because you’re always so frustrating.”
“...So, that’s why you tried to use the Revival Stone on me?”
“Yes. You wouldn't cut them off, so I had to help. They’re all just useless connections anyway, once we go back home.”
A crazy bastard who will stop at nothing to achieve his goals. 
That was Baek-ho’s nature.
I can see it clearly.
If I lost my memories, he would approach me with a friendly smile, pretending to be loyal, calling me "Hyung, Hyung."
But, reacting with anger would be a rookie move.
"Oh, okay. Well, thanks anyway."
“...Yes?”
"For the Revival Stone. It's a really valuable item, and I got it for free. You must have worked hard to get it. It wouldn’t matter if you’d achieved your goal, but you didn't."
I teased him, my tone dripping with sarcasm, as if there was no chance I'd ever return the stone. 
But the response was completely different from what I expected.
"Oh, really? I’m glad you have it, Hyung."
Not a feigned composure, but a genuine answer.
"You’re never going to die, Hyung. You’ll eventually reach the top and fulfill your ‘Wish.’ So, knowing that, do you know why I gave you the Revival Stone?”
He continued without giving me a chance to reply, as if my answer didn't matter.
"Because if you're resurrected with the Revival Stone, you’re not really dead. It won't affect the fulfillment of the prophecy, right?”
Simply put, it meant that if the Revival Stone could be used, then there was a possibility of me being in mortal danger.
“The prophecy is like a flowing river. The current flowing in one direction will eventually reach the end, but anything can happen along the way.”
That was Baek-ho’s reason for giving Misha the Revival Stone and taking it back.
Because the mere presence of the Revival Stone next to me meant that it could be used on me.
He was truly a cunning bastard, but I forced myself to chuckle calmly.
“Baek-ho, are you being a little emotional right now? Even if you're frustrated about not achieving your goal, don’t tell me everything. I’ll—.”
“Come on, I know you."
“……?”
"You wouldn't throw it away, would you? Your companions could die at any moment. I heard that you were really sad when that half-assed magician died."
His words, crossing the line, made my head go blank.
But, I couldn't refute him.
His words were right on the mark.
Even if there's a memory loss penalty, I wouldn't hesitate to use it on my comrades when the time comes.
I’d be grateful that I happened to have the Revival Stone.
“Well, if you’re really uncomfortable with it, then throw it away. I’m a little sad, but I can’t help it. I’ve got Plan B in the works, anyway.”
“…….”
“Speaking of which, what happened to Misha Calstain? If you found out about the Revival Stone yourself, it must have been quite a betrayal.”
“…….”
“Oh, your face tells me it’s true. If you’ve completely closed off your heart, then just give it back to me. It’s a pain in the ass to get another Ice Knight and raise it that high.”
“…….”
“But, isn’t that a little hypocritical? You’ve always manipulated and lied to others, Hyung. Just like Nyaong-i. Do you know about that Barbarian warrior? Did you know that you’re an Evil Sp—”
I stopped Baek-ho right there.
“Shut up.”
“...Yes?”
“Please, shut your mouth. I want to kill you.”
I honestly admitted it.
If losing is being angry in an argument, then I lost today.
In this spiritual world, you can't kill someone even if you want to.
But...
"Oh, scary. But Hyung, calm down. I’ve got a new offer for y—”
“Baek-ho.”
I closed my ears and spoke.
“Even if we say we’ll never see each other again, we’ll have to meet at least once, right?”
“Uh… I guess so?”
"I’ll grant your wish then, Hyung."
"What do you mean...?"
What do I mean?
You always said it, didn't you?
That you wanted to leave this shitty world.
"See you then."
I left the chatroom.
***
I was back in my room, slowly calming down. 
Hyun-byeol came to mind, waiting outside.
"She must have been quite shocked…"
But, I didn't want to go back to that chatroom and explain everything.
I needed to recharge the energy I'd spent.
Quietly, alone.
One minute, two minutes, three minutes…
After lying in bed for a long time, my mental strength finally recovered.
I was a bit regretful, thinking about all the things I could have said to Baek-ho, but...
Anyway.
“Huu…”
I got up from the bed like a zombie and checked the chatroom.
"[Independent Korea Forever]" - 0 users online.
Hyun-byeol wasn’t in the room.
She must have given up and left.
I felt sorry, but at the same time, I checked my inbox first. My chat request to the GM from earlier was still unanswered.
"I feel like I got ghosted..."
It wasn't a time when he could have missed it because he was busy.
But, I didn't feel frustrated or anything.
If I ever leave this dungeon, I can go to the GM and ask him directly...
Or, I can talk to the administrators, there’s a way to do that right now.
Click, click.
I manipulated the mouse, and a simple welcome message appeared before me, a message I've seen countless times.
"Welcome, Observer."
It was time for the final Round Table meeting.
