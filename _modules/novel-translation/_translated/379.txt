## Chapter 379: Atlantis (2)
After Amelia joined, we focused on farming the surrounding area. After all, someone had fallen into the ocean earlier, right? Throwing money into the sea would invite divine punishment. 
"Sailor, set course."
"Where to, captain?"
"Pione Island."
After the sea battle ended, we steered the ship back to Treasure Island. It was impossible to continue to the next island without repairs, and even getting this far had been a close call. 
"The ship is worse than I thought."
The magical propulsion system was broken, and we had to use sails and oars to return. In the midst of this, water began to seep into the hull. 
"Seems it wasn't just the propulsion system."
We had to tirelessly bail water until we reached Treasure Island.
"Finally, some rest."
"It was quite an experience, even if a little scary."
"Interesting, huh? What a weird taste she has."
Still, it wasn't a bad experience. Erwin, or was it Erwen, started by bailing water with us, but then she figured something out and used water spirits to reverse the flow. 
"That'll help next time we're in a situation like this."
"Yes, all these experiences make us veteran explorers."
In any case, once back on the island, we recalled the ship and then summoned all the broken vessels from the mainland. This time, we carefully checked their condition.
"Emily, do you think we'll make more money selling these ships for parts or as is?"
"I don't know..."
Amelia, usually adept at buying and selling, gave up on assessing the value. It was that difficult. 
"Regardless, it'll bring in some money. These ships are made of expensive materials, even just the scrap."
"Of course, but hey, sailor!"
"Yes!"
"Fix the ship."
I didn't ask if he could fix it. I told him to do it. The sailor looked puzzled.
"You're telling me to fix this?"
"Can't you?"
He flinched and shook his head violently.
"I'll, I mean, I can do it!"
His answer radiated a desperate determination. It seemed he thought that if he became useless, he'd follow his comrades to their fate. 
"Alright, just let me know if you need anything."
"Thank you!"
He rushed over to the damaged ship and began to meticulously observe it. It seemed he was figuring out how to repair it. 
Leaving him to the ship, I turned to the mage.
"Mage."
"...Speak."
"I want to take ownership of the ships. Do you know how to use that magic?"
"I can... "
"Well, I'm not surprised."
I had secretly been hoping he'd know, seeing him hang out with these pirates. A rare spell, I thought.
"Alright, then get ready."
"As you wish..."
"Woah, what a voice...  You don't want to do it?"
"No! I do want to!"
As expected. 
After persuading the mage, we took ownership of the ships. First, it was the flagship, whose captain had died, leaving it ownerless. Then we claimed the ships belonging to the two men, one each. 
But... 
"This one cannot be transferred."
"What? Why?"
"As you can see, the damage is too severe..."
It was the ship that had been hit by the 300% amplified ‘Brain Spear,’  whose damage was multiplied by 8. 
"More importantly, the core magic circle is broken. With this..."
"The magic circle is broken? But it was summoned and recalled just fine."
"Honestly, I'm surprised it's still functional...  "
"Then I guess we can't do anything with it."
The expert said it couldn't be done, so we had to give up on one ship. We did need materials for repairs anyway.
The sailor, who'd been looking at the flagship's destroyed rear with a troubled expression, quickly approached us after hearing our conversation. 
"Hey, can I take some of the planks from this one?"
"Sure."
"And maybe some manpower..."
"You can borrow all three of us."
"Thank you...!"
The sailor, now equipped with manpower, began asking the mage for advice and started repairing the ship. 
As for us... 
*SWOOSH*
We began to organize the spoils of war, all dumped onto the floor from the dimensional pocket. 
"This... is incredible."
We'd have to sell them in the city to determine the exact value, but even a glance revealed that they were all top-quality equipment.
"Of course, he was a 6th layer pirate."
Anyway, this loot would be enough to pay off all our debts and even buy another mansion. 
"Can... can we really make this much money so easily?"
Thinking back to the days we were mining mana stones the size of pebbles while hunting goblins, this felt unreal. A strange feeling lingered on my fingertips. 
"Erwen, we don't need to sell our house anymore, right?"
"Of course! We can get a nice new bed."
"Bed?"
"It's important. It makes all the difference."
"Can I get a new weapon too? I've had my eye on one."
Seizing the opportunity, Amelia voiced her desire for a new weapon. 
"...Of course."
"This was worth the effort."
"By the way... how much is it?"
I asked, and Amelia glanced at Erwen before whispering to me. 
"...Stone."
Twice the amount I expected. 
"...."
I took a deep breath, but I didn't take back my word.
"Go for it."
Investing in my comrades is never a loss. 
"Heehee, then with this, I'll forget about being abandoned on that ship."
Besides, I owe her a lot. 
***
It took two days to finish repairing the ships. I wasn't sure if that was fast or slow, but at least the ships themselves were well-made. Having the mage's help with the repairs was a huge bonus.  And, as it turned out, the sailor had experience working at a shipyard. 
"Sailor, what's your name again?"
"Are, are you speaking to me?"
"Who else?"
"My name is Auyen Lockrob, but..."
Okay, at least it wasn't Hans. That alone was enough to pass the preliminary screening.
"It's a good name. Good work, Nguyen."
"It's Auyen..."
"Oh, right?"
After acknowledging the sailor's successful repairs, we launched the ships into the sea. 
"What are you doing? Not getting on?"
"...Yes, I must."
The sailor climbed aboard, looking like he was heading to hell. Next was the mage. 
"Get on."
"...Yes, I will."
The mage boarded the ship, and the remaining two men nervously watched my reaction. I kept them alive to reach the island because I couldn't kill them on board, since that would release the ships from the dimensional pocket. 
"But..."
"We need skilled manpower for repairs."
They gave a sigh of resignation and headed toward the ship. 
But...
"Stop."
"...."
"You two are not coming with us."
They weren't skilled enough to receive a necklace. 
*THUD*
They stopped, their steps blocked by my shoulder. They looked bewildered.
"So, we stay here..."
They looked like they weren't sure whether to be happy or sad. Still, one of them was sharp.
"...Please, take us with you. We can be useful."
Hmm, they might actually be of use, I thought. But I didn't change my mind.
"Just stay here and rest."
"Damn..."
'Damn', how common. It's probably the top-ranking last words since I arrived in this world.
*CRUNCH, CRUNCH*
I gave each of them a clean break and threw their bodies onto the beach. The sea monsters will come soon enough to devour the corpses.
Alright, let's go.
*SPLOOSH, SPLOOSH*
I walked through the water, which was now tinged with blood, then climbed aboard the ship using the rope ladder. 
".....Hic!"
The sailor saw his comrades cast away like trash, and as our eyes met, he started shivering. 
"So scared."
"A little anxiety is good."
I approached him and patted his shoulder. Then I pulled out the map of the eastern sea and pointed to a spot.
"We're going to this place..."
"Of course! No problem!"
He answered before I even finished. Quite a satisfactory attitude from a captain's subordinate. 
A good subordinate should have a positive outlook. Though I'll have to teach him to stop cutting me off mid-sentence. 
*THUD, THUD*
Watching the sailor take his place at the helm, I walked to the bow and stood at the head of the ship.
I shouted loudly.
"Set sail!"
I just wanted to try it once. 
***
The ship was like a new bed. He made a world of difference, especially in quality of life.
"We don't have to stop at any islands?"
"Yes! It's for amateur sailors to stop and check their location. We don't have to worry about that!"
He answered with a confident tone, but he didn't miss the opportunity to show off a little.
"But I think we should stop by these islands."
"Then I'll make a new route!"
"Oh, you're really useful."
"Thank you! I'll engrave this praise in my heart! Forever!"
He quickly drew up a new route based on my orders and began steering the ship accordingly. 
Maybe he didn't like it. 
"Tch."
The mage, captured with us, clicked his tongue at the sailor. 
"He's different, I guess."
Mages are such high and mighty creatures. You gotta give them that. 
*WHOOSH*
The ship cut through the wind and sailed swiftly across the endless ocean. Erwen and I set up folding chairs and a parasol on the deck and relaxed. 
"This is sailing, yeah."
Our previous ship lacked such comforts. We had to manually check if the ship was heading in the right direction and help Amelia.  
"Emily, come relax."
"...I'm fine."
"Why?"
"..."
I tried to persuade Amelia, but she just returned to her spot. Which, by the way, was next to the sailor.
Out of curiosity, I peeked over and noticed Amelia intently observing the sailor as he manipulated the helm. 
"Hold on, why did you turn the helm like that?"
"Oh, the sail tilted a bit, didn't it? That's what they call a "tilted wind", and in this case, you're supposed to turn the helm slightly..."
Amelia was not just observing but actively engaging in conversation with the sailor, asking him various questions. 
I didn't know she could be this curious. 
She listened intently, nodding even, her gaze more focused than I'd ever seen before.  I couldn't help but chuckle.
"No wonder she looked a little disappointed when I said I'd let him handle the sailing."
It seemed she actually enjoyed controlling the ship. 
"She'd never admit it, though."
"She'll probably say she's just learning in case something happens."
In any case, time flew by. 
It was a very peaceful time. We sailed with a fair wind, and whenever the sailor reached our destination, we'd get off and hunt monsters. Then we'd head to the next island.  Amelia, for her part, diligently learned about sailing from the sailor.  Erwen and I just fished.
"Oh! Haven't had a catch like this in a while."
Amazingly, we'd always find something even while sailing. 
"Wow, you're amazing, Erwen."
Most of the catches were just ordinary fish. Well, more accurately, they were like the Deadmen we hunted in the Blood Fortress - they were judged "Unranked." No mana stones, no essences, and their corpses would disappear. 
But...
"It's a Shellfish Monster!"
Sometimes, a monster would take the bait. It's the reason I keep fishing. 
[You have slain a Shellfish Monster. EXP +4]
These monsters are more difficult to encounter than to hunt, as they only appear in the ocean. 
This was more than just killing time, it had actual benefits. 
In any case, our routine continued for a while. As we headed east, we left the initial sea territory.
I heard Amelia talking to the sailor.
"Do you know why the compass doesn't work from here?"
"Hmm, well, some say there's a Sea Pole God who messes with explorers who approach him. But it's probably just a legend."
Sea Pole God, huh? Is it Leviathan? We'll have to catch him sometime. 
"Anyway, from this point on, it's hard to tell the direction, so the sailor's skill becomes crucial. This is actually where most novice sailors hit a wall."
"How do you navigate then?"
"Stars, sun, temperature, weather, they're all information. But of course, experience is key."
"That's fascinating. Can you tell me more?"
"Heehee, of course. Oh, we've got the wind now! Would you like to hold the helm?"
"...May I?"
"Sure. I'll help if you go off course."
"Then..."
When did Amelia become so friendly with the sailor? She's not going to take him in and feed him so he won't leave, right?
"Amelia wouldn't do that, right?"
I chuckled and closed my eyes for a moment. When I opened them, the wind had stopped. 
A calm, a notorious feature of the vast ocean.
"The magical propulsion system is the most convenient in this area."
We used the mana stones we'd saved to push through the calm. 
By the way, The mage didn't fix the broken propulsion system, he replaced it.  The other three ships had working propulsion units, so we took those apart and used them.
Apparently, a medium-sized ship needs three smaller propulsion units to match its original output? 
"There's wind now!"
After spending two days passing through the calm, we reached an area filled with reefs. 
The Grand Rock, where rock and volcanic islands make up 99% of the landmass.
I smiled as I scanned the sea, which had its own unique characteristics. 
"I can't believe we managed to find a sailor like this."
Time to explore the subterranean island, Atlantis.
