##  The Jester (3)
An unexpected turn of events. There was no other way to describe it, but it wasn't enough to make him give up and succumb to despair. At least, that's what Avet Necrapeto thought. After all, wasn't this the case?
"Field Effect - The Underworld is granted."
This place was the Underworld. A place that could only be entered with the aid of a Necromancer's graduation weapon – a staff.
"All non-living entities within this area receive a 200% increase in physical attributes."
"All living entities within this area receive a 20% decrease in physical attributes."
This was practically a Necromancer's paradise.
"Undead within this area will not perish."
Undead summoned here could be defeated, but they would revive after a short period, as if nothing had happened.
"The character possesses a symbol."
"The character receives the blessings of the Underworld."
Characters possessing the "Underworld Staff" are classified as "non-living" and cannot die. 
Well, there were ways to overcome that, but regardless…
"Pssst…"
There was no need to be scared here.
Thud.
Of course, the approaching giant, radiating an aura like a war tank, was intimidating.
Thud.
He wasn't entirely confident that he could break through its absurd defenses and land a critical hit. However…
'…If I can just hold out!'
He decided that he could at least try to run away. 
After all, despite its monstrous defenses, the Barbarian lacked mobility. He had experienced this firsthand during a recent chase. 
Of course, he also lacked mobility, which almost led to his capture. But…
"Oh, you're laughing?"
The situation was different now. His physical attributes were significantly enhanced, and his summons were far stronger. 
Analyzing the current situation calmly, he saw no reason to be afraid of the Barbarian. Therefore…
"Why, is it not allowed? Pssst..."
As his confidence soared, his heart calmed accordingly.
"Well, it's not like it's forbidden… but I'm just curious why you're so different from before, when you looked like you were about to die."
"Die? That's an exaggeration. I was just a little surprised. Pssst..."
His shoulders, which had been slumped in fear, straightened as his body responded to his emotions. 
As the saying goes, positivity begets positivity.  As he started thinking positively, his advantages became clear.
'Twenty-four hours… should be enough.'
After twenty-four hours without anyone dying, everyone would be expelled from this location and returned to their original position. 
But there was no need to worry. 
'Until the Commander arrives.'
Before he had blocked Bjorn Yandel, he had received news that the Commander, who was waiting in Sector 4, was heading to Sector 8. 
Even if he was delayed, the Commander would arrive by then. And that monstrous Commander would undoubtedly handle that mysterious knight.
A person could defeat monsters in the labyrinth, but…
A person defeating the Commander was practically impossible.
If he could somehow survive and return, the knight would be either dead or already running away, waiting for his return to set up a siege.
Then, even this tenacious Barbarian –
Thud!
He was in the middle of thinking, you know. 
Barbarians are always so rude.
Whoooooosh!
A barbaric, unsophisticated strike with no semblance of grace.
"Pssst."
With a slight backstep, he easily dodged the attack and chuckled.
"Slow."
The Barbarian must have been quite surprised. How did he dodge so easily?  It would have hit him before…
'Huf, huf, he's clueless indeed.'
That clueless Barbarian knew nothing about the 'Underworld.'
Knowing this information was a double advantage.  So, that meant…
'Hm… maybe I should just try to capture him?'
He had only dodged one attack, but that single dodge gave Avet Necrapeto immense confidence and a touch of greed.
After all…
Avet Necrapeto, the collector of corpses, defeating Bjorn Yandel in a one-on-one battle?
What a fantastic story it would be…
Pssshhhwwt!
A green gas erupted from the ground between the man and the Barbarian. The Barbarian took a step back to avoid it.
He didn't think much of it. If an unknown gas suddenly erupted from the ground, it was natural to step back and avoid it. But what was this?
"What is this, why aren't you getting hit?"
...Huh?
He tilted his head, unable to comprehend the latter part of the statement.
"What are you talking about now?"
"What, you don't know? It's a bit awkward for me to explain…."
The words seemed to indicate that he knew about the gas.
The man felt something was wrong, but he asked again for confirmation.
"...Are you saying you know where we are?"
"Why wouldn't you know? You summoned us with your staff, the Underworld. That gas curses me if I get hit, and strengthens your blessings if you get hit."
"..."
Avet Necrapeto was speechless at the Barbarian's concise explanation.
"What? You really didn't know?"
He wasn't completely oblivious to it. 
He was just surprised that the Barbarian knew it so accurately.
His mouth went dry for a moment, but upon reflection, there was no reason to panic.
"...Th, that can't be. I know 'a little' about the Underworld. It's famous, after all."
"Oh, so we're starting again?"
As if he didn't want to talk for long, the Barbarian roared again, a battle cry that could drive anyone mad, and charged towards him.
And…
[GRRRRRRRRRRRRR-!]
Avet Necrapeto also summoned the corpse he felt most confident in from his sub-space inventory.
When he first saw the Barbarian, he thought of running away first. But he planned to give it a try first, to see if it was a viable option.
However…
"Wow, it has the [Barrier] trait? How much did you modify it?"
The Barbarian recognized the trait of No. 3, which had only appeared once after countless modifications.
And…
"This one's weakness is here, so it's easy."
KWAAK!
No. 3, with its damage immunity, was struck in its sole weakness and collapsed limply.
Of course, thanks to the field effect, it would revive soon, but…
'…How, how does he know?'
Avet Necrapeto felt his confidence falter and his unease rise slightly.
Still, he tried to hold onto hope, but…
"...The [Punisher] trait can just take a hit."
KWAAK!
"Ah, the [Musician] trait should be dealt with first."
KWAAK!
The Barbarian moved efficiently, as if he understood all the truths of the world.
"Oh, it's a 'Underworld Firefly'? Easy peasy."
The Barbarian smashed every field monster he saw that had the trait of increasing dark resistance upon death.
He also hit the ground that had suddenly bulged outward.
'…Why is he hitting that?'
"Ah, you don't know? Hitting this increases your resistance."
Hidden piece of information that even he, who had visited the Underworld countless times, didn't know.
KOOONG!
He tried it himself, and he felt his skin slightly tougher…
DU-KOON!
The feeling of 'something being wrong' grew stronger.
But he didn't give up and waited for the right time. He pulled out his trump card.
"Th, this, however, you cannot block!"
"Oh, so you're finally ready to summon?"
"...?"
"What, you weren't trying to summon the Demon King now?"
"..."
That's right. 
When someone with the Underworld Staff enters the Underworld, they can summon a field boss if certain conditions are met.
He was planning to summon it now.
But…
DU-KOON!
How did this Barbarian know about this too? As if he had visited the Underworld countless times…
"Ah, even if you know, it won't matter! You can't stop it like that!"
He raised his staff high.
He targeted the moon, high in the sky, and once again cast the 'Underworld's Call'.
And…
[I smell the scent of the living.]
The voice of the Transcendent echoed throughout the Underworld.
Even though he knew it was an ally, Necrapeto felt a shiver down his spine upon hearing the voice.
He still clearly remembered the Demon King who instantly killed the one who dared to challenge him during Orculis's 'Rank Battle'.
But he still wasn't sure.
Bjorn Yandel.
Even if you searched through the history of Laphdonia, he was a 'Guardian' whose skills were unparalleled.
Even with the 'Underworld Staff,' it was impossible to kill someone like that in one blow.
But…
'I can inflict a major blow, I think.'
Necrapeto decided to check it out for himself, just this once.
If he received a major blow, he would fight more actively and try to kill him.
But if it only resulted in minor damage…
'How do you kill someone like that?'
He would accept that it was an impossible task from the start, and run away without looking back, just stalling for time.
Whoooooooosh!
What would the outcome be?
[Living being, I ask.]
The Demon King, too massive for words…
No, he looked down at the planet and questioned him.
[Why have you set foot on the land of the immortal?]
It was a pointless event in his eyes.
No matter what answer the living being gave, the Demon King would unleash his fury and strike down with his palm –
Pssshhhwwt!
…what?
'What is this?'
At that moment, the Barbarian suddenly plunged into the green gas that was erupting from the ground.
It was an incomprehensible action.
Knowing that he would be cursed if he entered there, why did he go there willingly…?
The answer came quickly.
[Did I see wrong?]
The Demon King vanished with those words.
"No, no! Demon King! Here, here! There are living beings here, please come back! Come back..."
Necrapeto, who had regained his senses belatedly, shouted to the sky, but the Demon King, who had already disappeared, did not reappear.
"..."
The silence of emptiness ensued.
Pssshhhwwt!
The eruption of the gas from the ground ceased, and the Barbarian, who had been hiding within it, emerged with a smirk.
"You didn't know, did you?"
A question asked with the utmost nonchalance.
Necrapeto was so dumbfounded that he felt a sharp pain in the back of his head.
'…How can you know that?!'
The one who knew about it was the anomaly.
He had never seen anyone dodge the Demon King's summoning like that before…
The same was true for the writings of a certain necromancer who was known to have possessed the 'Underworld Staff.'
Nothing like this was written in those writings.
"...H, how do you know everything?"
Necrapeto asked in a resigned tone. The Barbarian shrugged and muttered.
"Why would I tell you?"
The Barbarian's usual mocking tone.
"You learn by getting hit when you don't know."
But the following words made Necrapeto realize something instinctively.
DU-KOON!
It wasn't just a feeling of something being wrong.
This was…
DU-KOON!
It wasn't just wrong, it was already wrong.
***
Under the green sky.
Tada-da-da-da-da-da-da-da!
I was running across the barren plains.
Tada-da-da!
Ahead of me, a modified four-legged Chimera was carrying the Corpse Collector, running away from me.
'Well, maybe I pushed him too hard?'
The battle itself was incredibly easy.
No matter how much the corpses had been buffed by the Underworld, Necromancers are fundamentally a type of player that relies on quantity.
Naturally, even their elite units would have low individual attack power. They couldn't possibly catch me with that type of attack.
The shield Barbarian gets stronger the more physical attacks he takes.
Moreover, I had played Necromancer myself, so I had a good understanding of the class. And I had visited the Underworld countless times, so there were no unexpected variables.
"The accumulated damage has exceeded a certain threshold."
The problem was that he seemed to have lost his nerve after countering the Demon King and just ran away.
'It's about time… for this.'
I wasn't sure how much the stack had accumulated. Running through the hordes of corpses while taking every hit should have helped build it quite a bit.
'Well, I'll find out when I check.'
"The character has used the [Aegis's Dragon Armor]."
As soon as I activated the armor's active effect, a Soul Warrior appeared behind me and charged forward.
It wasn't as impressive as the Demon King I had just seen, but it was large enough to make things surreal.
The one who had just turned his head around started freaking out.
"...W, what in the world is that?!"
He's really acting like a kid.
Does he really need someone to spoon-feed him everything?
'If you don't know, get hit and learn.'
Whoooooosh!
He took a step forward and swung his massive Greatsword.
For that overwhelming sword, the distance between him and me was nothing.
KWAANG!
A thunderous boom, as if the earth itself was cracking, and a cloud of smoke shot up into the sky.
"Avet Necrapeto has used [Momentary Immortality]."
Okay, so I got rid of his invincibility with that…
Heehee.
I can kill him next time.
