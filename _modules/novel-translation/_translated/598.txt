## The Third Record (1)
Chapter 11 of the rift in the basement's first floor. Or perhaps, Chapter 3 in my terms. Whatever.
This chapter's clearance condition is simple. Rescue Erwin and me, and then survive in this city until nightfall.
The information about this was gathered by the navigation function of the magician, Gavyn Besilrus.
“…You just know it intuitively? Can you explain it in more detail?”
“Haha, I wish I could… But my literary skills can't express it any further.”
“Then don't express it. Just answer my question with yes or no. You can do that much, right?”
“Well, since we have to wait until nightfall anyway. Give it a try.”
“Do you hear a voice in your head or something?”
“Hmm, not quite.”
“Do you have to see something for it to come up?”
“That's also no. It’s more like I feel an immediate sense of what I need to do every time the location changes… Ah, of course, that feeling sometimes arises when I receive clues or information.”
“I see.”
As I kept bombarding him with questions like a game of Twenty Questions, I understood why this old man couldn't explain it any better than calling it intuition. 
‘It seems his sixth sense stat is maximized when it comes to rift strategies.’
That’s the best I can do to explain it. It’s a convenient ability, no doubt. 
But my overall assessment was that relying solely on this might lead to a major setback. 
“Speaking of which… Baron Yandel, you're quite inquisitive, aren’t you? I’m truly surprised. Hahaha…”
Gavyn Besilrus smiled kindly at me, saying those words.
Translated literally, it could be shortened to. 
‘Will you stop bothering me already?’
Geez, why do all nobles love to beat around the bush.
“Just one more question.”
“…What do you want to know?”
“Do you also know what happens if we leave the city before nightfall?”
“There’s no need for a yes or no answer for this one. You can't get out of the city in the first place.”
“Can't get out?”
“There's a high-level dimensional magic spell surrounding this city, invisible to ordinary barrier spells. Others passed through it normally, but we couldn't.”
“I see… As promised, that’s my last question. Thank you. Now rest.”
“Haha…”
He must have liked my response, because he didn’t say anything further and just went to a corner to find a place to sit. 
Watching him crouch down carefully, clutching his waist, I found it a bit funny, yet perplexing.
‘Why is this old man’s appearance the same?’
Because of that, I can't get immersed in the story.
Erwin, who plays the role of my younger sister, became a little girl. So why is this old man just the same?
‘No, how did he even attend the academy like that?’
I mean, a grandpa in a school uniform among young students? Didn’t anyone find it weird?
I was curious about Gavyn Besilrus's experience in Chapter 1, but I decided to ask that later when I had time. 
If I ask now, he'll probably hate it, and…
There were other people to talk to.
“Archbishop Hesthia.”
“…Yes, Baron. What brings you here?”
“Just wanted to chat for a bit.”
I sat next to the archbishop, collapsing onto the floor, and he moved away slightly, uncomfortable.
“I have nothing more to say about my abilities beyond what I already mentioned…”
“It doesn't matter. That’s not why I came.”
“Then…?”
He looked at me with an inquisitive gaze.
He must have thought I was going to be a nuisance like I was with Gavyn, but…
That's not what I wanted to ask.
“I have a question about the inner affairs of the Reahtlas order.”
“The order’s internal affairs… you say?”
My casual mention made his face turn rigid instantly.
If he was a kind neighborly grandpa a moment ago, now, he was like a business partner sitting across a negotiation table, radiating pressure.
“Tell me… what is it?”
It wasn't a clear acceptance, nor a refusal, but an ambiguous answer.
So, I started by gauging him.
“I'm curious about Sven Parav’s standing within the order.”
“Lord Parav’s standing…”
He hesitated for a moment, then looked at me.
“I don’t understand. Can you explain what you mean?”
Too fierce eyes for a religious man.
The archbishop seemed unwilling to answer a simple question like that.
Therefore, there was only one method left.
“Archbishop, including you, other believers seem to hate and bully Sven Parav. So — ”
“Did Lord Parav tell you that?”
“No, I just feel that way.”
“Hmm, is that so?”
He seemed lost in thought for a moment before regaining focus, looking back at me and answering.
“You're mistaken.”
“Mistaken…?”
“Yes.”
“But I see — ”
“Even if you see it that way, Baron, you are simply mistaken. So please focus on what you need to do.”
“Uh…”
“It’s an internal matter of the order, after all, isn’t it?”
He was displeased, but I didn’t show much of it and stepped back.
“…That’s true.”
The archbishop’s reaction surprised me for two reasons.
First, I didn’t expect him to react so strongly.
And second…
‘His reaction is so strong that it’s suspicious.’
Seeing that response alone was a worthwhile gain.
If he was just using Sven as a disposable pawn because he was an evil spirit, he wouldn’t have shown that kind of reaction.
‘Then there must be another reason…’
Hmm, what could it be?
As I pondered, I saw Gavyn leaning against the wall, glancing at me. He must have been curious about my conversation with the archbishop.
“Ahem.”
When our eyes met, Gavyn averted his gaze awkwardly and closed his eyes.
‘…I need to rest too.’
After that, I spent the rest of the time resting by Erwin's side. 
How much time had passed?
“Lord Besilrus, it's been well past nightfall. How much longer should we wait?”
When nothing happened even at midnight, we finally decided to leave the basement and go up to the first floor.
It was Gavyn's intuition that we should go up…
“You were hiding down there! I've been looking for you!”
A knight standing alone in the empty house discovered us, or rather, Gavyn, and approached us with open arms.
“Who are you…?”
“Haha! Who am I? Even after all this time, you don’t recognize your friend?”
The knight approached us with a voice full of joy and took off his helmet.
“…….”
Judging by his expression, Gavyn, who is playing the role of my brother, still didn’t recognize him. 
But…
“Mister. I’ve met this person before. That imperial knight who helped us escape from the village. It's him.”
“Haha, little miss seems to have grown even smaller since then?”
Erwin knew the identity of the mysterious knight.
And…
“Yandel, you seem to be in a similar situation.”
Coincidentally, I also knew him.
[Escort a young girl. Make sure she reaches her destination.]
He’s the knight who entrusted me with the escort mission in Chapter 1.
Of course, nothing about this was particularly surprising.
Hiding Erwin in a cave and then entrusting me, a knight, with an escort mission? Totally believable. So is him being friends with Gavyn, who plays the role of my brother.
The truly astonishing part came next. 
“Ah, since there are some of you I haven’t met, I should introduce myself first.”
The knight laughed cheerfully and revealed his name.
“Rabiqion Cummelbi Raphdonia.”
Upon hearing that name, which no resident of this world would ever perceive as a human name, groans of despair filled the air.
“Ah…”
“Uh…”
“Hmm…”
…This guy is the Immortal King?
***
The Immortal King, Rabiqion III.
The man who saved Raphdonia, which was just a small territory, from the end and made it the continent's last bastion.
The village chief downplayed his achievements, claiming it was all because he had a 'good friend', but the truth of him being a historical figure remains unchanged.
However…
“Just call me Rabiqion, everyone. The enemy of my enemy is my friend. The friend of my friend is also my friend, isn’t it?”
It feels awkward, especially because the Immortal King in my head was a monster armed with charisma, radiating an oppressive atmosphere. 
“Now then — ”
“Wait! Can we… Can we talk about this for a moment?”
Gavyn, who is playing the role of 'friend', interrupted him, unable to hide his confused emotions.
“Talk… Well, I’ll step aside for a moment.”
“No need… I can just use magic.”
“Go ahead. But it’s best to finish it quickly. You never know when the imperial army might attack.”
“Don’t… worry. It’ll be… quick.”
Gavyn, with permission from the knight, immediately used voice-activated magic and spoke.
“Is, is everyone… really convinced? This, this, this guy’s words…!”
The archbishop was the first to respond.
“Perhaps he just shares the same name. Doesn’t Rabiqion III mean there was a Rabiqion II and I?”
“Ah, ah… Yes, yes… ”
Did his brain finally start working?
Gavyn muttered to himself, as if organizing his jumbled thoughts. 
“I heard the first lord and the seventeenth lord used the name Rabiqion. Their ancient lineage predates the construction of the last bastion. We don’t know their middle names, but… Yes, maybe it could be one of them…”
Gavyn’s words felt like he was desperately grasping for any evidence to deny reality. 
Of course, the village chief immediately cut him off.
“Lord Besilrus, please be serious. We are already in an era where witches have appeared. It’s impossible for him to be Rabiqion I or II.”
“Ah, ah…”
“If you are really curious, ask him what his wife's name is. Well, if he is pretending to be the Immortal King, that’s pointless.”
“Th, then I will deactivate voice-activated magic.”
Gavyn deactivated the magic.
He was trembling, unable to even make eye contact, so I spoke on his behalf.
“Rabiqion, what’s your wife’s name?”
“Ah… You seem to suspect I might be someone disguised as me, don’t you?”
“Answer first.”
“Karnos. That’s my wife’s name. She is currently managing the territory in my absence. She’s also taking care of the things you requested.”
“Requested…?”
Gavyn tilted his head, seemingly clueless, and the village chief cleared his throat, giving him a meaningful look.
‘Ah, come to think of it, he said that there were cases where he acted out of character in previous chapters, leading to complications…’
There was no need to cause unnecessary suspicion to the Immortal King, who was presumably an NPC helper.
“Anyway, take this first.”
“What is this…?”
“Hmm… You're acting strangely today. It’s the item you requested. You called me all the way here for this.”
“Ah…! Y, yes?”
Gavyn took the black gem, looking confused.
And immediately.
Swoosh — !
Black mist began to seep out of the gem.
Instinctively, I tried to take a step back, but my body didn't move.
‘What, is this a betrayal?’
That possibility crossed my mind, but thankfully, the Immortal King's face was filled with genuine concern.
“Truthfully… I still don’t know.”
“……?”
“Even if that item works properly and gets to the Great Abyss safely, and you end up facing the evil god.”
A sudden story. 
Even without the navigation function given to the magician, I understood it immediately after hearing it.
“There is no guarantee that the evil god will grant your wish.”
This is the mission of the next chapter.
“I’ll leave now before the imperial army arrives. Good luck then.”
With those words, the world turned pitch black.
