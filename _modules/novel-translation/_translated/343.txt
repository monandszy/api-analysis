## The Return (2)
Before entering the Round Table, I had run countless simulations.  After all, a gap of two years and six months had suddenly appeared.  It was clear that the members would have questions about my absence. 
'Perhaps some people might have reached the truth about me being Bjorn Yandel based on the fact that our disappearances coincided.'
Of course, I wasn't overly concerned about this.  Only Amelia and Erwen knew that I had returned.  Just showing my face at the Round Table would dispel those suspicions. 
The real problem would come after I announced my survival...
'Well, there's always a way out then.'
The most important part right now was something else.  How could I explain my two-year and six-month absence?  I had run countless simulations considering various scenarios, finally arriving at a conclusion.
"The Investigator..."
"...You really are alive."
Even if they cast glances of shock and doubt.  There was no need to explain. 
"Are you not going to move?"
"Oh… yes…!"
As I uttered those words, the clown standing by the door flinched and retreated towards the wall.  The Soul Queen did the same, though she was far less stunned than the clown.
"...You're still the same, Investigator?"
She observed me with an air of curiosity, even as she made way for me.  I found her casual tone unsettling, but I didn't show it.  I simply ignored her and walked past, taking my seat with an air of indifference.
"..."
"..."
The following moments were filled with an unsettling silence. The members stared at me intently, but also stole glances at each other, gauging their reactions.  Their thoughts were clear.  They wished someone would take the lead and fire off questions.
'Ah, this feels good.'
Perhaps it was because I had been hiding in my house, unable to stretch my limbs for so long.  A sense of liberation, almost addictive, surged through me. 
Several seconds passed in silence. 
"Thump!"
The doors connecting to the Round Table, previously open, slammed shut with a resounding thud.  It meant that the entrance time had ended at 3:10.  In other words, the meeting could now commence.
Therefore...
"Are you going to stand there forever?"
I turned to the clown and Soul Queen.
"Sit."
I have a lot to hear from you.  And a lot to tell.
***
"Hee hee, I guess I made a fool of myself."
The clown, who had been glued to the wall in a daze, finally came to his senses and took his seat.  He gazed at me with eyes that could not hide his joy.
"Welcome back, Investigator, I truly rejoice at your return."
What is this guy on about?  Did he forget what I said about not trying to get close to me last time?  Then again, two years and six months is a long time.
"..."
I simply ignored him, and he chuckled as if he had expected it.
"Reason."
The next to speak was the Stag.
"You didn't show your face for over two years.  Why have you finally decided to show up now?"
He had always been known for his macho demeanor, and now he stood up and demanded an explanation.  Of course, my answer was already prepared.
"I don't know."
"You won't answer?"
His tone rose slightly at my refusal to speak. It sounded like the voice of a royal family member interrogating someone.  It was truly a pity.  All I did was take a break for two years and six months.
"Unpleasant."
I spoke as coldly as I could, and...
"Whoooosh!"
Slowly, I unleashed my aura.  It had been a while, so I decided to re-establish my authority.
"...Ugh."
The Stag, exposed to my aura, clenched his fists as if in pain. This was enough to establish a proper attitude, but I wasn't satisfied.  I continued to pour out my aura and continued speaking.
"Never again."
The Stag’s throat bulged with anger at my words. He was better than the clown, who had been wriggling on the floor like a worm, but he was still no different from the Stag.
"Don't look down on me."
As I unleashed my aura with all my might, the Stag's body began to bend, as if weighed down by something.  Looking at the Stag, struggling to hold my gaze, I spoke with satisfaction.
"Yes, that’s right."
The Stag was now kneeling on the floor, looking up at me.  He was at his limit, his arms supporting him on the table trembling slightly.  But, to be honest, I was at my limit too.
'Ugh, my head.'
As I felt a throbbing pain in my head, the aura that had been pressing down on the room vanished without a trace. 
And at the same time.
"...Ugh!"
The Stag inhaled sharply, having finally released his breath.  The clown sneered at him.
"...Hee hee, foolish and stupid human. Did you forget how to ask the Investigator anything?"
"..."
"Bring something interesting! Interesting things!"
The clown glanced at me, as if asking, 'Right?' and expecting praise.  Of course, I ignored him once again.
And after what felt like an eternity...
"Investigator."
A man's voice broke the silence.  It was the Crescent Moon.  He was believed to be of the fairy race, and the one who yearned for the Stone of Rebirth more than anyone else at the Round Table.
"I don't care what you've been up to."
He spoke, swallowing down the anxieties and doubts he had harbored for over two years.
"Thank you for coming back, at least now."
This was exactly the kind of response I had expected.  But honestly, I felt a little sorry.  This man must have been so worried about my absence.
'Maybe I should give him a clue this time?'
I was thinking this when...
"Hmm, I think that's all settled then?"
The Soul Queen broke the tense atmosphere with her cheerful voice.
"Shall we begin then? I have a feeling we all have a lot to say to each other."
And so the meeting began.
***
The process of determining the order was short.
"So, it's the Fox's turn first?"
"...It seems so."
The order was always the same, clockwise.  Except for me, who always sat at the end.
"Why do we have to sit here…."
This was an unspoken agreement that had existed since the beginning.  They would share their information first, and then I would listen and evaluate, finally providing some information in return.  This was how the Round Table usually functioned.
"...I don't have anything special prepared today, so I'll just share what I originally planned to tell you."
The Fox, in her turn, shared her information.  It was a fascinating story, right from the start.
"The Dragon Slayer, who stopped working after the Grand Priest's kidnapping three years ago, has reappeared in the Dark Continent for the first time. According to witness testimonies, he seemed even stronger than before, and it appears he has solved the 'Dragon's Curse' to some extent."
An update on the Dragon Slayer, who had been forgotten for so long.
'He's freed himself from the Dragon's Curse...?'
It was unfortunate news, but I decided not to get too caught up in it.  Having the ability to wield dragon words wouldn't change anything.  I'm not the same as I was.
"Whoooosh!"
The jewel on the Round Table emitted a green light, signaling the end of the Fox's turn.  But at that moment...
"Hee hee, the Fox is clever too."
The clown cackled and addressed the Fox.
"...What do you mean?"
"That wasn't what you originally planned to share, was it? You could even deduce your identity from that story."
"..."
"Since the Stag is looking at you like that, it must be a new development, even for the Royals. Did you perhaps meet the Dragon Slayer yourself?"
"I will not answer any personal questions."
"Well, it’s fine.  I can just ask the Dragon Spawn directly in the Labyrinth about who he met there later."
The Fox shut her mouth, her expression unpleasant at the clown's impolite behavior.  The turn naturally passed to the next.
"So, it’s my turn… now."
It was the Stag's turn.  As he was about to share his information, he met my gaze and averted his eyes with an awkward expression.  It seemed the effects of my aura from earlier were still strong.  However, he didn’t want to show it, so he spoke as if nothing had happened.
"The Royals will soon issue a conscription order for all noble knights."
His gaze was fixed on the clown, as if trying to gauge his reaction.  However...
"Hee hee, are you trying to scare me?  It only makes it seem like you're desperate.  It’s not as if I'm scared."
The clown simply sneered as usual.  The Stag didn't react to the provocation, and his turn ended.
The green light dimmed, and the Crescent Moon spoke up.
"My turn now."
He had been eager to share information ever since I had brought up the Stone of Rebirth, so I was looking forward to it.  However...
"Unfortunately, I haven't prepared anything special."
He wasn't expecting my visit today, so he prepared me for disappointment.  He was worried that I might be disillusioned and stop coming here in the future.
"It's about the Blood Queen."
Surprisingly, some intriguing information came from his mouth.
"A few weeks ago, the Blood Queen, claiming to be in need of money, took most of the funds the Royals granted to the fairies.  She didn't disclose the reason."
A story that could almost be considered an internal scandal.  The Soul Queen, listening quietly, expressed her doubts.
"But even if she’s the Blood Queen, can she just take that much money without a reason?  The Royals' funds must be significant, right?"
"It is certainly an unprecedented act. But the elders had no choice, because she said she would sell the Sacred Tree Palace to someone else if they didn't give her the money."
"...Sell the Sacred Tree Palace?"
"Shameful, but it’s true.  However, since she said she needed the money for something urgent, we can only believe that she has some unspoken reasons."
The other members were also not hiding their unease at the Crescent Moon's explanation.
"Hee hee, what is that crazy woman scheming?"
"If she needs such a large sum of money, it must be something related to that."
"Whatever it is, it's going to be a bloodbath."
I felt strangely uneasy.  What kind of public image did Erwen have for these people to react like this?  But more importantly…
'She told me not to worry because she had plenty of money. Did she get all of it by robbing the fairies?...'
I wasn't amused.  I wondered where she got the money to buy a mansion overnight, and it turned out it was probably from this.
'What happens to the fairies if they find out about this?'
I would be devastated if it were me...
I was thinking this when the goblin spoke hesitantly.
"So… can I go next?"
Ah, right, it’s his turn.  
'He was a Leahtlas knight, wasn't he?'
Since I knew his identity for sure, following the clown, I was a little curious about what information he would share...
"The Main Temple has decided to merge all its forces except for the First Knight Order with the Royal Army."
What, another war-related story?
I felt a pang of disappointment but chuckled.
'Main Temple, so they're not even trying to hide anymore.  Or maybe their identity is public now after two years.'
I was curious about the conversations that had taken place at the Round Table in my absence, but my ears were wide open.
The short conversation about the Leahtlas' future moves ended, and the next member was about to speak.
"Hee hee."
It was the clown's turn.
"Everyone, the Investigator is back for the first time in a while, so how about some exciting stories instead of these boring ones?"
The clown tilted his head dramatically, then instantly changed his expression and revealed his information.
"The Stone of Rebirth is with Baekho."
...What?
***
The clown's casual revelation sent shockwaves through the room.  And the one who reacted most strongly was the Crescent Moon.
He always carried a look of hatred when he saw the clown, and now he couldn’t contain his emotional turmoil, muttering.
"Baekho...? The one the Royals have secretly issued a kill order for...? He has the Stone of Rebirth…?"
The Crescent Moon was surprised to hear about the Stone of Rebirth's whereabouts, but I was different.
'Why is Baekho suddenly…?'
His name was so random, and when did this guy even become so famous?  Two years ago, he was just a name known only to a few, referred to as "that guy."  How did he even get the Stone of Rebirth? You can't obtain it even if you know the conditions unless you're lucky.
"What do you think?"
Unfortunately, I didn't have time to sit there in a daze.
"Since you mentioned Baekho, I thought it might be interesting for the Investigator too."
As soon as the green light dimmed, the clown subtly asked for my opinion.  After a brief moment of hesitation, I replied.
"Definitely."
It was more valuable than the other information I had heard.  I was more curious about this than war-related stories.
However, I couldn’t be too enthusiastic.
"Not bad."
I kept my reaction to a minimum.  This kind of response was necessary to keep him supplying me with information in the future.
'I should ask Erwen about Baekho when I get back.'
I quickly finished my thoughts and looked straight ahead.
"Clown, are you telling the truth?"
"You'll know if you see it."
"Give me some more details at least—"
"Hee hee, I'd rather not."
The Crescent Moon, suddenly reduced to a mere pawn, was being insulted by the clown.  It was pitiful, but I could do nothing.  This was the first time I had heard about Baekho having the Stone of Rebirth.
'Hmm, this makes it hard to use the Stone of Rebirth as a bargaining chip...  What information should I share later?'
I was thinking this while watching the situation unfold when the Soul Queen clapped her hands to get everyone's attention.  
And…
"Now, it's my turn, right?"
She looked directly at me, out of all the members present.
With a seductive voice, she spoke.
"The Investigator has no record of ever logging into Ghostbusters for the past two years and six months."
"..."
"Where the hell have you been for the past two years and six months?"
Wow.
***
On the 15th of every month, community members are automatically brought into this spirit world.  Of course, you can log out immediately and leave, but…
"No record of logging in? What are you talking about?"
"Literally, there’s no record of you logging in."
It's strange that the log-in record is completely gone.  They must have checked this with the GM.
"That’s why I thought you were dead..."
She wouldn’t have just assumed I was dead.  This woman would have confirmed that I was Bjorn Yandel.  I was the only famous person who died around that time.
Did the Soul Queen notice a contradiction in my statement?
The goblin blurted out his question.
"Dead, what? Didn’t the Queen say she was waiting for the Investigator?"
"No, I was waiting for the Master.  The one who created this Round Table.  I used to visit periodically, in case he might come again."
"Oh…"
The goblin nodded in understanding.  With that, everyone’s attention was focused on me. Their intention was clear.
"Whoooosh!"
The green light from the Round Table confirmed it.  It was true that I hadn’t logged in for two years and six months.  They must be expecting me to give an explanation.
"Ah, are you going to avoid answering?  Well, this kind of talk probably isn’t interesting information for the Investigator—"
I cut her off.
"Bold of you."
"Then why are you afraid?"
Her face was full of composure as she met my eyes.  Even if I unleashed the aura that had made the Stag tremble, she looked as if she had a way to counter it.
"Intriguing."
"Oh, so you’re going to tell us? What happened?"
I glanced at the jewel, now dim, and replied.
"It’s my turn now."
"Are you ignoring me?"
"No."
I was simply punishing her.
"Magician, Yurven Havelion."
I had to make it clear to her, for the sake of the Investigator's authority in the future.  Even if it meant using my aura to subdue her.
"That's the GM's name."
This was a lesson for those who dared to defy me.
