## Chapter 387: Wild Horse (1)
The rushing water cascaded over my head, and I rubbed the soap vigorously across my skin like I was scrubbing away dirt. How much time had passed? As I stepped out of the shower and changed into comfortable clothes, it finally struck me. I was home. 
Thump, thump. I haphazardly dried my hair with a towel and headed downstairs. Amelia and Erwen were gathered in the living room, waiting for me.
“You took your time,” Amelia grumbled, her expression tinged with displeasure as she observed my freshly washed appearance.
I took a seat on the opposite couch and asked, “Since you didn’t use a written message, I assume nothing significant turned up?”
“Indeed, contrary to your concerns, we couldn’t find any listening devices or the like.”
Thank goodness. I’d been worried those scoundrels might have installed something while they were ransacking the place. 
“Well, not including what was already there.”
Huh? What was already there?
“Your expression tells me you’re oblivious. A recording crystal has been installed in the living room since long ago.”
She stated it matter-of-factly, but I was completely in the dark. However, her mention of it being there from the start provided a clue. 
“Erwen?” I looked at her, my gaze demanding an explanation. Erwen flinched, avoiding my eyes.
“W-well… you never know, right…….”
“…..”
“I-it might have been helpful in figuring out what happened to you so quickly, if we hadn’t had that…….”
……I’m speechless.
To my surprise, when I asked, she said that the recording crystals were only in the entrance hall and living room.  It seemed a perfectly reasonable security measure for a homeowner to take. 
‘No wonder they found me at the Duke’s mansion so easily.’
While riding back in the carriage provided by the Duke, I voiced the question that had been plaguing me. “Erwen, how did you know I was at the Duke’s mansion?”
“Of course I knew!  That man came here himself!”
“That man……?”
“Oh, didn’t you know, Sir?  The commander who tried to take you away was Eltora Terselion, the Chancellor’s son!”
“What? That guy? The one who became the new head of the Third Legion?”
Is the Chancellor insane? 
Would he really send his own son on such a dangerous mission? What would he do if I’d cracked his skull open over there?
‘No, if he truly cherished his son, he wouldn’t have sent him to the battlefield in the first place.’
I had to admit, the Duke’s parenting style seemed decidedly Spartan, but it wasn’t my place to judge.
“More importantly, what exactly happened at the Duke’s mansion, Shwitz?” 
“Yes, please tell us.  I was so worried when I came back and found the door broken and you weren’t here.”
I explained the Duke’s misunderstanding and the deal he’d offered me, then listened to their opinions.  
Their reactions were polar opposites. 
“Oh, the Duke restored your title? How wonderful!” Erwen was overjoyed at the good news.
“The Chancellor might be the perfect figure for backing, but there’s something about this that just feels off,” Amelia shared, voicing my own anxieties.
“But what can we do?  Refusing there would have just made things worse.”
“I’ll look into the Chancellor separately.” 
“Alright, I’m counting on you.”
“What about me?”
“Of course, Erwen, I’m counting on you too.”
Honestly, the only people I can trust are my companions.  
This world is too harsh to survive alone.
***
Tap, tap.
I was lost in thought, tapping my index finger rhythmically against the table when the door swung open, and a man walked in.
“You called, Father?”
Eltora Terselion.  The Duke’s only son, destined to inherit everything the Chancellor had built.
However, the Duke’s gaze upon him was icy cold.
“You have eyes and ears, so you’ve seen and heard what you needed to.  What are your thoughts on this?”
“Honestly, I’m quite shocked. I never thought Bjorn Yandel, the Baronet, was still alive, as you said.”
“Is that all?”
The Duke’s reply caused Eltora to swallow, before cautiously continuing. 
“His return could be seen as a positive for our house. Even though it’s been years, many still remember him.  His symbolic presence could be used—”
“Stop.”
Eltora’s words, spoken in a logical tone, were abruptly cut short by the Duke’s interruption.
“Is that all you see?”
The Duke’s gaze, laced with disgust that went beyond disappointment, was fixed upon his son. 
Eltora lowered his eyes, sighing inwardly.
‘I wonder what the old geezer’s been up to lately.’
He wasn’t exactly known for his kindness, but he’d never been this cruel beforejmn.
He’d been getting a little worse over the past two years, but lately, he’s like a walking garbage bin of emotions.  
‘And he brought that mysterious woman here… Could he have figured something out about me?’
It was suspicious.
Lately, the Duke had only called him when he had orders to give, and even then, he hadn’t properly shared any information.  
As he had in this case.
“Father.”
“Speak.”
“I found out today that Baronet Yandel isn’t an evil spirit.  Why did you keep it from me?”
Eltora asked cautiously, hoping to probe his father. The Duke replied coldly, “Does it sound like I should be taking care of you forever?”
“That wasn’t my intention. I merely thought I could have been more helpful if I had known—”
“The very notion that Baronet Yandel isn’t an evil spirit is wrong.”
“What? But Father, you clearly said—”
“Enough. It’s pointless to tell you.  You wouldn’t understand.”
It was a cruel comment, even for a father speaking to his son. 
Eltora clamped his mouth shut, and the Duke, unfazed by his son’s reaction, revealed the reason he had called him.
“Tomorrow, go see Yandel yourself and tell him the date.  Let’s continue our conversation we didn’t finish today.”
“When should I set it for?”
“The 15th of this month.”
The time was evening.
***
The 15th, afternoon.
“Have a safe trip.  Be careful!”
As I left the house with Erwen’s farewell, the door of the carriage waiting at the entrance opened.
“Long time no see.”
“Are you finally done with the honorifics?”
“You’re the Duke’s son, right?  You must know who I am.”
“Well, yes, but…….”
The Chancellor’s son’s expression was slightly bitter as he responded, but I wasn’t about to let that bother me.
“Forget it, just go.”
“Alright.”
The carriage sped along the wide carriageway.  
Soon, the military teleportation portal appeared. I used it to travel to Carnon, the capital city, just like I always did.
“It takes less than an hour to reach the capital. That’s convenient. How much does it cost to use this portal?”
“It’s about a million stones per person, if you assume you don’t have a carriage, of course.”
“…..At that price, it’s better to just take the carriage.”
“True.  Apparently, not many noble families use this with their servants. They only use it when they need to travel quickly.”
As we chatted, the carriage arrived at its destination.
A colossal mansion in the distance.  
How much would it cost to secure this much land in this expensive capital?
“Let’s go. Father is waiting.”
“You’re saying it’s not a recording crystal this time?”
“I told you. Father wants to have dinner with you.”
Whatever.
I thought he just wanted to have a virtual dinner.
Squeek-
The Chancellor’s son led me to a dining room on the fourth floor.
One side of the wall was a large window, offering a panoramic view of the garden outside and the beautiful royal palace in the distance.
Well, I didn’t have time to admire the view.
“You’re here.”  The Chancellor greeted me from his seat of honor.
“Long time no see, Duke Terselion.”
“Welcome.  It must have been a long journey.  Have a seat, Baronet Yandel. And, Eltora, you can leave.”
“…..Have a good time.”
The Chancellor’s son left, making the already empty dining room feel even more desolate.
However, this couldn’t be a better setting for a private conversation.
Tap.
I took a seat opposite him.
Perhaps to prevent servants from entering while we ate, the table was already laden with food.
As a side note, there was five times as much food in front of me as there was in front of the Duke.
He must have taken my species’ unique characteristics into consideration.
“Eat freely. I wouldn’t dream of forcing etiquette on you.”
“If that’s the case.”
The Duke picked up his knife and started carving the meat. I followed his lead, picking up a drumstick and biting into it.
And then……
“How is the food?  To your liking?”
“Excellent.”
“That’s good to hear.”
We continued eating while we began our conversation.
I knew that talking about work during a meal was considered bad manners in the Lapdonian etiquette, but I was the only species exempted from such formality.
“Duke, the food’s good, but it’s time to get down to business.”
“You mean how I’m going to restore your title?”
“Yes.  If I suddenly return, many won’t believe I’m alive.”
The Duke, undeterred by my impoliteness, continued the conversation.
“Before I tell you, I want to ask.  Do you think there were any people who knew you while you were in Noarck?”
“No.  I kept my identity hidden there.”
“That makes things much easier.”
The Duke then proceeded to explain his plan.
“We’ll pretend you were sent on a secret mission from the Royal Family to infiltrate Noarck. You were there for two and a half years, and now you’ve returned after completing your mission. What do you think?”
A scenario that could be summarized in just a few sentences.
However, whether it would work was beside the point.  
The Duke had the ability to make this plan a reality.
“Not bad.”
“Of course, it will take some time. I’ll need to create forged documents from the Royal Family.”
“What about the proclamation that I was an evil spirit?”
“Don’t worry about that.  We’ll just say it was a necessary part of your infiltration.”
I liked the scenario.
If I returned like this, I could reclaim my old life.
However, the issue was…
“What do you want in return?”
What would I have to give up to obtain this?
The Duke lowered the knife he’d been using to carve the meat and raised his hand.
“Two things.”
“Tell me.”
“I’ll form a special unit with you at the helm, and you’ll lead them into war.”
“For how long?”
“Until the war is over.”
So he wants to use me like a slave.
“That’s a bit too much to ask.  I can’t just commit to fighting until the war is over.”
“Let’s make it three years maximum.  If the war ends before then, the deal is over.  Of course, if you make any achievements during that time, you’ll be rewarded accordingly.”
Well, the conditions aren’t unacceptable, at least on the surface.
Most adventurers these days are making a living by fighting in the war.
“What about the second thing?”
“The second thing is…”
The Duke trailed off, setting down his fork.
“I’ll tell you tomorrow morning.  It’ll be much easier to explain then.  We have plenty of empty rooms, so stay here tonight.”
This is like the old 60-second countdown reveal.
***
After dinner, the servants led me to my room. 
Even if it took longer to get home, I really wanted to go back and relax. But… 
‘This feels suspicious.’
The day and time the Duke invited me to his mansion, and his sudden request that I stay the night.  
It all pointed to something specific in my mind.
I decided to follow the Duke’s request and spend the night here, asking the servants to just let Erwen contact me.
Sometimes, a crisis is an opportunity.
“Sigh….”
This room was too big and luxurious for one person.
Click, click-
I lay on the bed, turning on only the magic lamp on the bedside table. Then, I turned off the magic lamp and placed the clock on it.
Click, click, click.
The second hand moved with a regular tick-tock in the silence.
Click, click.
After ten more ticks, it happened.
[[The character’s soul resonates and is drawn to a specific world.]]
I immediately sat up.
This time, I had to hurry.
