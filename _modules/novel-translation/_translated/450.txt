## The Barbarian's Road (Chapter 450 - Extended (3))
A noble is the king's servant.
Then, is it possible for such a noble to simultaneously hold the position of leader of a race? 
If someone were to ask this question, the answer is quite simple: no one knows.
"It's unprecedented, after all."
It was obvious that if such a case were to occur, the noble society would be thrown into a frenzy.  After all, nobles are servants of the king. They are meant to serve the king and the kingdom, not a specific race.
Even though there are no legal or institutional restrictions, there exists an unspoken rule. 
But…….
"Let's move."
The chieftain made no mention of such political issues. It was unclear if he was unaware of the unspoken rule.
However, I had lost my interest in this matter. 
What did it matter if the chieftain knew or not? Even if he did, the outcome would not have changed. He was still a Barbarian after all. 
Such matters are inconsequential. Just like the thousands of warriors roaring beside me at this moment.
"Behel—laaaaahhhhhhh!"
"Behel—laaaaaahhhhhhh!"
We moved towards a place called the "Ground of Proof," a location where warriors, who usually sparred and fought anywhere, gathered for the sacred "duel."
"It's just a big pit dug in the middle of the forest, though."
In reality, the "Ground of Proof" was rather crudely constructed. The ground was uneven, scattered with pebbles, and sometimes duels were even held in a pool of rainwater.
But…….
Thump-!
The moment I arrived, a warrior's heart started to pound. What did it matter if it was on a grand marble floor or amidst towering statues? The important thing was that the chieftain brought me here.
Unlike when we fought before, he did not simply swing his ax. 
"I feel... acknowledged."
It was a strange sensation. I am not a true Barbarian warrior.
Thump-!
Why am I so excited?
Woosh-!
The chieftain on the opposite side jumped into the pit, which was over seven meters deep.
The ground shook as the dust flew up. Before following him down, I exchanged a glance with Einar. 
But…….
"What's this?"
He nodded his head in encouragement as our eyes met, but he wasn't laughing boisterously as usual.
Suddenly, a thought struck me. 
"...Maybe she thinks he lost to me."
It would make sense. After all, Einar had spent time studying in the library, striving to become chieftain while I was away.
Perhaps she was unhappy about my challenge today—
"Bjorn……."
At that moment, Einar approached me, her face devoid of laughter and her voice stiff.
"I, I'll be waiting for you to return victorious! Understand! I’ll have faith in you!!"
A sense of emptiness washed over me.
What’s this, was she just more nervous than me?
"Thanks for taking the pressure off."
I chuckled and met his outstretched fist with my own.
"I understand. Have faith in me."
With those words, I followed him down to the pit, no, to the Ground of Proof.
Woosh-!
A tingling sensation raced up from my feet, and the air filled with the scent of damp earth. From above, Einar’s voice rang out, overpowering the crowd's roar.
"He, he, the great warrior has promised victory—!!"
"Behel—laaaaahhhhhhh!"
This is so embarrassing, I can't lose now.
"Though I never intended to."
I gazed at the other side of the pit. Beyond the swirling dust, the chieftain was slowly approaching.
Thump, Thump.
His footsteps, somehow, resonated even through the deafening noise.
Thump.
The chieftain stopped at a distance, pulling a large ax from his back. I quickly gripped my hammer and shield, assuming a stance.
And…….
Swish—
There was no self-introduction like in noble duels.
No priest chanting eloquent words to receive the participant's oaths like a certification process.
No loud arguments or threats like a brawler's fight.
Just this.
"……”
The moment our eyes met, signaling our readiness.
"Behel—laaaaahhhhhhh!"
"Behel—laaaaaahhhhhhh!"
Without hesitation, we charged at each other.
***
The ax clashed against the shield.
콰아아아앙-!
The chieftain, who was a few centimeters taller, swung his massive ax down.
We stood in a tense stalemate, locked in a struggle of strength.
"Back then, even with [Gigantify] on, I was lifted with the ax still grasped."
A sudden flashback. But the result was undoubtedly different this time.
Back then, I hadn't received the "Dragon of the Earth's Blessing" from the little dragon, nor did I have the Essences of Bayon, Stormgush, Ball-Hurchan, or the Deep Sea Giant.
Now, there was no reason for me to lose in a battle of strength.
But…….
"Character has activated [Gigantify]."
I amplified my size first, pushing back the chieftain along with his ax.
I haven't liked it since earlier.
Ziiiip-
That constant looking down.
"Character has activated [Ferocious Eruption]."
"Character’s threat level temporarily increases threefold, proportionally increasing physical strength."
I swung my hammer, roaring at the chieftain as he was pushed back.
"Character has activated [Swing]."
"Blunt weapon power increases significantly, proportional to strength."
Instead of dodging, the chieftain blocked the blow with his ax.
콰아아아앙-!
A deafening sound echoed as our weapons collided.
"Gudnulf Olga has activated [Friction Heat]."
It felt as if a bomb exploded before my eyes. A wave of scorching heat brushed past my cheeks.
But that was all.
"The target’s weapon absorbs a certain amount of impact."
"Heat has been generated."
That’s a stacking skill.
"……”!
Its power increases as the heat stacks, but it’s a skill that’s pretty useless in the early stages of combat, only slightly reducing impact.
The massive warrior’s body bent in a crushing manner.
"Okay, the angle isn't bad."
I slammed my massive foot into his abdomen, sending the chieftain flying like a soccer ball.
Airborne, in technical terms.
Wooosh-!
There was no reason to miss this chance when the enemy was in the air, so I swung my hammer as if it was a baseball bat.
But, in that moment.
Whoosh-!
The chieftain jumped high, kicking off the air.
"Gudnulf Olga has activated [Flame Leap]."
It was one of the [Leap] skill’s higher-level variations.
Unlike the Manticore’s version, it could be used even while airborne, but the range was slightly shorter.
But most importantly, the additional effect was different.
"The next skill used will have 200% increased fire damage."
Damage multiplier option, a rare addition to movement skills.
That’s why it was practically considered a graduation movement skill in the flame-based route.
"Gudnulf Olga has activated [Thunderfire]."
The chieftain landed behind me and swung his ax down.
콰아아아앙앙-!
An explosion erupted on my shield, sending shockwaves through my body, a sensation I hadn't felt in a long time.
"Heat has been generated."
It felt like fighting a massive monster.
I swung my hammer, determined to return what I received, as was the warrior's way.
And…….
Whack-!
What? Why did that hit.
The hammer struck the chieftain's jaw, sending him back three steps.
"Ah... This guy's a strength build too..."
Is it because I’ve been fighting mostly weak builds lately?
The blow I swung out as a mere probe hit, leaving me with a strange feeling. However, as expected of a strength build, his durability was on a completely different level than a weak build.
Kwaang-!
I swung my hammer again before he could recover, but he had already regained his composure and blocked it with his ax.
"Heat has been generated."
Three stacks now?
It’s probably about that, but there’s no need to count exactly.  It’ll announce itself when it reaches ten stacks.
"Heat has been generated."
"Heat has been generated."
"Heat has been generat—."
"…….
As I continued to exchange blows, the stack began to build.
"The charged heat will enhance the next strike."
"Gudnulf Olga has activated [Flame Leap]."
"The next skill used will have 200% increased fire damage."
The chieftain leaped high, swinging his ax down.
How can I possibly withstand this basic combo?
Thud.
It wasn't impossible to block, but to conserve my shield's condition, I simply took a step back, creating some distance.
And…….
콰아아아아아아앙-!
The ax slammed into the ground, creating a crater large enough to bury three people.
"Okay, so he has ten stacks now?"
For reference, this type of attack boost triggers every ten stacks, so it’s important to keep an eye on it.
If I get hit in the head, even I’m in danger—
"Huh?"
While thinking that, the chieftain stomped on the ground.
It was the skill of a Grade 3 monster, Healthsmith.
"Gudnulf Olga has activated [Thump]."
"The flames embedded in the earth awaken."
Honestly, I was a little surprised.
I didn’t expect him to pull out his ultimate move so early, before even properly building stacks.
콰아아아아아아아아아앙-!
The ground split, and flames erupted, engulfing the chieftain’s body.
Or, rather, it was more accurate to say that they covered him than engulfed him.
[Thump] was a kind of buff skill.
"All fire skills have their damage significantly increased."
"Physical strength proportionally increases in accordance with flame affinity."
"Continuously burns the surrounding area."
The chieftain, enveloped in flames, immediately kicked off the ground and dashed at me.
Whoosh-!
I blocked the swinging ax with my shield, but a tingling sensation spread through my skin from the scorching heat.
It’s a little better now that I’m using the Orb of Flame.
"Orb of Flame activated."
"Reduces all flame-based ongoing damage received within a 15-meter radius by 50%."
Good thing I brought it.
"Behel—laaaaahhhhhhh!"
"Bjorn, son of Yandell, is pushing back the Flame Warrior!!"
"Wooooooooo—!!"
Several exchanges of blows followed, and as the roars from the watching Barbarians echoed, I was clearly on the offensive.
It’s because I have the advantage from the beginning.
콰아아아앙-!
I blocked the ax with my hammer each time.  He couldn’t break my stance since he was also outmatched in strength.
Whoooosh-!
The flame damage I received was easily covered by my natural regeneration.
"The charged heat will enhance the next strike."
I avoided any attack that could be dangerous, never forcing it.
The chieftain must feel wronged. 
If I were a pure tank with no damage output, maybe it wouldn't be so bad.
Whack-!
For a warrior who prioritizes defense, the weight behind my hammer blows, which I swung out as a probe, must have been fierce.
Oh, of course, this doesn’t mean I have overwhelming dominance.
콰아아아아아앙-!
As expected, the chieftain was not an easy opponent.
"The charged heat will enhance the next strike."
I used a fake by swinging my ax without the [Flame Leap] combo, crushing my Adamantium shield.
"Gudnulf Olga has activated [Natural Resonance]."
"Gudnulf Olga has activated [Fuse]."
He unleashed several threatening skills fitting his Flame Warrior concept.
And, of course, not only that.
"All stats temporarily increase due to charged heat."
When the stacks reached fifty, he went completely wild.
"Gudnulf Olga gains regeneration proportional to the flame damage dealt by his unique skill [Ashes]."
"Gudnulf Olga gains a stat increase proportional to the resources used by his unique skill [Scorch]."
The various effects of the Golden Sun sigil route were more troublesome than expected.
Seeing [Scorch] activate, his sigil was probably at least rank 9.
"Ha, so he's this tenacious even without being a tank."
I internally praised him multiple times. The chieftain was like a textbook example of a high-level Barbarian warrior.
Powerful damage, sturdy body, and regenerative power that doesn’t fear getting hurt.
And, above all…….
"Behel—laaaaahhhhhhh!!!"
The more he’s cornered, the more ferocious he becomes.
"His title… was Flame Warrior, wasn’t it……."
Now I understand the story of the chieftain’s youth.
He was scouted by a team with the largest clan, receiving team leader treatment, because of the eighth floor's dungeon, the Frost Monarch’s Palace.
Back then, I thought he was just a normal chieftain.
"Definitely… someone worth taking in…."
The chieftain, who was said to be weak compared to past chieftains, was still powerful enough.
But not enough to overcome the clear difference in class.
"It’s about time."
Time to end this.
"One, two, three…."
The moment I finished counting silently, the flames around the chieftain faded.
"[Thump] has been deactivated."
His ultimate buff had finally come to an end.
I pressed my attack with even more force.
콰아아아앙-!
I activated [Swing] on every attack, seamlessly connecting [Transcendence] and [Eye of the Storm], not even giving him a chance to breathe.
Of course, this will drain my MP quickly…
"But I haven't used [Soul Dive] yet."
Sensing my determination to end this, the chieftain’s resistance became even more fierce.
And…….
Crack-!
My shield, which had been dented multiple times while blocking his ax, finally shattered.
How much will it cost to repair?
This thought crossed my mind even during this tense moment, but it was still a good deal in the end.
If it wasn’t for the shield, it would have been my arm that broke.
Whack-!
I used my shieldless hand to punch the chieftain in the jaw. Even with his jaw dislocated, the chieftain glared at me and swung his ax.
Kwaang-!
I blocked the ax with my hammer.
And, in that instant.
"All heat has been charged."
The chieftain’s ax, glowing a crimson red as if freshly forged from a blacksmith’s furnace.
Hah, so he finally reached full stacks.
I tried to end this before it got to this point.
"The stat increases due to heat are greatly amplified."
It had reached full stacks, but the chieftain’s condition wasn’t good. Blood flowed from his forehead, and his entire body was abnormally swollen— arms, legs, abdomen, everywhere.
Honestly, I wonder how he’s even standing.
"Ah."
Only then did I realize.
That’s how the others felt when they looked at me—
"Bjorn, son of Yandell."
The chieftain asked.
"Come on, if you're going to talk, at least stop swinging that red ax."
It was the first time he’d spoken to me during the battle, so I focused on avoiding his ax while also listening.
"You’ve grown stronger."
What was he trying to say? Was it this?
"You'd be a worthy leader for the tribe."
His eyes were far from those of someone accepting defeat.  In fact, his following words were not much different.
"But……."
He roared.
"Losing is still frustrating!!"
"……”
"So! I… I’m the one who wins……!!!"
He roared as he charged at me, his attack undeterred by my furious hammer blows.
I responded as I always did.
Dodging what I could, blocking what I could, taking what I had to, and swinging my hammer until he fell.
How long had it been?
“————!”
“——, ——— ——!”
The sounds around me were muffled, as if I had earplugs in. 
The warriors on the cliff, I’m sure they’re still roaring their hearts out at this moment.
But, the only noises that reach my ears are the ones I need for the battle.
Nothing unusual.
“———, —————!!!”
There’s that saying, isn’t there?
Barbarians only hear what they want to.
Right now, it’s the chieftain’s breath, the friction sound of his feet against the ground.
Wooosh-!
Just the sound of the wind.
Thud.
I didn’t see it with my eyes and dodge.
My body simply reacted before I could think.
I kicked off the ground and stepped back, and in that instant, the crimson ax grazed my upper body, swinging from bottom to top.
"……”!
What was that just now?
How did I dodge? I would have definitely been hurt if I hadn’t. No, wait. How did his ax even reach that angle?
Shivers ran down my spine.
My mind is filled with questions.
But my body had already made its decision and moved.
Crack-!
I swung my hammer, striking the chieftain's hand gripping the ax.
Even with his wrist twisted unnaturally, the chieftain didn't let go of the ax.
So I swung the hammer again.
Crack-!
This time, his wrist shattered, sending the ax flying to the ground.
However, I was mistaken in thinking the fight was over.
"……?"
The chieftain, with his one remaining hand, clenched his fist and glared at me.
A silent indication that the fight was not over.
"Ha… So this is the true Barbarian…."
All sorts of emotions flooded my being.
I felt a sense of resentment alongside a sense of satisfaction—this is what a Barbarian should be like.
There was also a sense of regret.
Hah, I wanted to end this with a more spectacular KO, for everyone to see.
"But I guess it’s okay…."
Our Barbarians would definitely appreciate this, too.
Woosh-!
I threw my hammer carelessly to the ground.
I deactivated the active skill [Gigantify].
And…….
"Behel—laaaaahhhhhhh!"
I fought alongside him until the chieftain was satisfied.
Whack-! Whack-! Whack-!
It seemed I wasn’t the main character today.
"Th, the victor has been decided……!!"
"Bjorn, son of Yandell! Bjorn, son of Yandell is the new chieftain……!!"
Finally, the succession to the chieftain ended long after lunchtime.
