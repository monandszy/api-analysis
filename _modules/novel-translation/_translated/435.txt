## The Rival (1)
Ihan-su’s room felt oddly unfamiliar today.
‘It’s… cramped.’
A feeling of claustrophobia washed over me, unlike the usual cozy atmosphere that permeated this space. I wasn’t even in the body of a hulking Barbarian.
‘Whatever, let’s just turn on the computer first.’
Quickly dismissing the strange sensation, I switched on the mainframe and logged into the community.
[Daehan Dokrip Manse] - 0 users online.
I checked the Korean chatroom first, but it was empty.
‘Is Hyun-byeol still not here?’
There was no point in entering an empty room, so I navigated to the bulletin board with the mouse. As expected, posts were rapidly regenerating, from idle chatter to requests for advice. 
Among the diverse topics, one post caught my eye:
[Breaking News) Bjorn Jandel, Thought to Be Dead, Returns.]
Content. 
The writer’s eagerness was evident in the post. It seemed they desperately wanted to be the first to post the news, as the content was simply two characters: “Content.” 
However, as it was the first post, comments were pouring in real-time with each refresh.
[Harbinn: Wow! This is news that will surely shock the Count and horrify the royal family!]
[└Sogeking33: Definitely. The writer’s audacity to call this breaking news after almost two weeks is shocking, to say the least.]
[└these99: And the content is just “Content.”]
[└Writer: But I was fast.]
The general sentiment of the comments was similar. After all, most had already heard about my return, so there was no need for frantic excitement. 
But some reactions were more genuine, as if they were hearing it for the first time.
[showmustgone: What? Is this true? Bjorn Jandel is alive? I thought he was dead!]
[└Sogeking33: Was he imprisoned in a basement or something? It’s been ages since Jandel declared his return from the Glory Palace.]
[└IsABot: I was there when he declared his return. Honestly, it gave me goosebumps.]
[└arolf5205: To apologize to the bereaved family before even greeting the empty throne, that’s a whole other level of bravery. I always thought I was the manliest one, but now I realize this is what a true man is all about.]
[└WingPizza: The expressions on the nobles’ faces were priceless that time.]
[└showmustgone: Return from the Glory Palace, its rightful owner? What kind of nonsense is that? Bjorn Jandel is an Evil Spirit!]
[└ReDCod: Apparently, he wasn’t an Evil Spirit after all. He faked his death and was carrying out secret missions for the royal family.]
The responses were amusing, so I kept reading them before hitting the refresh button one more time.
[vaman:  But am I the only one who finds the writer suspicious?  They don't even know about the rumors circulating throughout the city.]
[└vaman:  Is this guy maybe from Noark?]
Oh, now that you mention it, he is suspicious. 
Noark’s upper echelon would have known about my existence. If they controlled information, it wouldn’t be unreasonable for some people to be unaware.
[└WingPizza:  I’ve already reported this to the moderators.]
It seemed the others were handling the report, so I stopped reading and checked the chatroom. And then…
Thump.
My hand froze over the mouse. It wasn’t shock, but more like a feeling that what was inevitable had finally arrived.
[Daehan Dokrip Manse] - 2 users online.
Two people were in the chatroom despite my absence.
There were three possibilities:
1. A completely random person had stumbled upon the room.
2. The GM had contacted Hyun-byeol. 
3. Or…
Thump!
Baekho had returned.
“Whew…”
If the GM had granted my request to unban Baekho within three months, then it’s likely Baekho was inside. But…
“Let’s go in.”
I’ll know once I go in. If that’s a tiger inside or not.
Click click.
As soon as I double-clicked the mouse, the screen turned white and the surrounding space changed. The luxurious mansion was decorated according to Baekho’s tastes.
Crackle, crackle, crackle-
Two figures sat on the sofa in front of the fireplace, emitting a white noise.
“Oh, Oppa!”
One of them was Hyun-byeol, as expected.
“Why are you so late!”
She seemed relieved and happy to see me, probably because she had to rush out the last time after her argument with the Count. However, before I could reply…
Swish.
My gaze, momentarily fixed on Hyun-byeol, shifted to the side. The person there was looking at me.
“Oh, right. You two should greet each other. This is a fellow Korean, like us—”
Hyun-byeol, who had been watching us, tried to naturally guide the conversation. But, unfortunately, her consideration wasn’t needed.
“We’ve already been introduced.”
“Yes. We’ve already been introduced, unni. We know each other.”
The guy quickly rose from the sofa with a smirk and walked towards me.
“It’s been a long time, hyung. I missed you.”
He treated me very differently than when we met outside. The change in his attitude felt incredibly strange, but I greeted him as naturally as I could.
“Yeah, it’s been a while, Baekho.”
I missed him too.  I had a mountain of questions to ask him. 
***
Crackle, crackle, crackle-
The fireplace peacefully crackled, spitting out embers. The three of us sat on the sofa in front of it, engaged in a casual conversation. At least, it seemed pleasant enough on the surface.
“So, hyung and unni actually knew each other before and met again here?”
“That’s right.”
“Wow, that’s amazing. I’m really good at taking care of people I know when they come here.”
Baekho tilted his head innocently, wondering why nobody he knew ever came. He glanced back and forth between us, his eyes narrowed with mischievousness.
“So… what kind of relationship did you two have back then?”
Hyun-byeol looked at me before answering. 
“We weren’t a couple.”
She wasn’t the kind to gossip about her personal life. That’s what I liked about her.
“Come on, you weren’t just ‘not a couple’, were you?”
He persistently tried again in a playful voice, but his teasing demeanor disappeared from Hyun-byeol’s face.
“Excuse me, Baekho-ssi.”
“Oh… yes?”
“Why are you suddenly talking casually?”
“Oh… this isn’t casual, it’s… well, it’s like a casual formality… you know, you use it when you’re close…”
“Oh, I see… but are we close?”
Wow, it’s been a while since I’ve seen this. 
That stone-cold expression.
“…”
Baekho seemed taken aback by her response, but he quickly recovered from his momentary fluster.
“You’re really sensitive about these things, aren’t you?”
His voice, a bit more aggressive than before, hinted at his usual off-the-cuff personality. Hyun-byeol, of course, didn’t even bat an eye.
“Is it up to me to judge whether it’s trivial or not?”
“Well, yes, it is. But if you’re going by actual age, I’m older than you, you know.”
An unheard-of statement in Confucian Korea. 
Only Baekho, who had spent over a decade in this world, would dare to say something so disrespectful. 
“Haa….”
Hyun-byeol let out a sigh laced with annoyance and said, 
“First, Baekho-ssi is the one who called you ‘unni’, even though real-world age is more important.”
“But—”
“Second, I never asked for such a thing.”
“However—”
“Third, I don’t consider Baekho-ssi my brother. I just think of you as a stranger I met today.”
“Oh…”
“So I’m using honorifics, right? Like I’m doing now.”
Hyun-byeol, who had maintained a stern expression until that point, finally softened her features and returned to a smile. The tension that had been building quickly dissipated. 
“So I hope you keep your distance from now on. It’s not a difficult request, is it?”
In the end, Baekho was the one who lost the verbal battle. 
“Oh… yes…”
“Can you do that?”
“Yes…”
Baekho, unable to retort, meekly nodded. A wry smile played on his lips. It seemed even he found the situation amusing, to some extent.
‘He can’t handle Hyun-byeol either.’
That’s useful information.  It’s reassuring to know that Baekho should be careful not to provoke Hyun-byeol, even though he seems to have matured a lot.
“Ahaha… but Hyun-byeol…ssi and Han-su hyung, you guys know each other, right?”
“Huh? What are you talking about? Know each other?”
It seemed Baekho wanted to change the subject, so I quickly agreed with him.
“Oh, not in real life, but in the city… ah, what do you call it?”
“Are you asking if you’ve met each other within the city?”
“Yeah! That’s it, that’s it.”
Not yet.
I was about to honestly answer, as this wasn’t anything to hide, when Hyun-byeol interjected.
“Why are you so curious about that?”
“…”
Baekho froze as Hyun-byeol did.
“Baekho-ssi, you’re really nosy. You keep asking questions without giving any information about yourself.”
“…”
“Yes.”
“…”
Ugh, this is so awkward.
“Hyun-byeol, stop teasing him.”
“But he keeps asking about my personal information.”
“…”
“He probably didn’t mean any harm.”
“That’s for me to decide. He’s a stranger I met today.”
“But I’m not a stranger! I’m a Korean, like unni! Unni!”
Baekho protested, but Hyun-byeol wasn’t swayed. 
“Aren’t there criminals in Korea?  The Korea I lived in wasn’t like that.”
“…”
“If you really want to know, tell me who you are, what kind of person you are, and what you’re doing here.”
“…What? Me? Why?”
“So I can feel a bit more at ease.”
“Oh… but even so, that’s a bit much… You know, a guy needs to have some mystery… Ahaha….”
“Baekho-ssi is an interesting person.”
Hyun-byeol’s eyes weren’t smiling at all as she said those words. An awkward silence followed. 
Ugh, he’s going to run away if this keeps up.  I haven’t even gotten to the main point yet.
“Hyun-byeol.”
“Why?”
“Can you please leave for a bit? I need to talk to Baekho.”
Baekho flinched at my request. He stared at me as if I’d lost my mind. Of course, he didn’t know Hyun-byeol well. 
“…Alright. Can I come back later?”
Hyun-byeol hated it when people crossed boundaries without permission. That’s why she never crossed the lines others drew. Well, there might have been an exception or two, thinking back to that day.
“Don’t disappear without a word. I’ll be waiting outside, so come back immediately if I suddenly disappear.”
“Okay. And thanks.”
“…”
Did Hyun-byeol find my thank you awkward? She looked at me with strange eyes before leaving the chatroom.
Finally, we were alone.
“Hyung….!! No, hyungnim!”
Baekho stood up, looking impressed.
“Hyungnim is the controlling type! That’s right! I knew it!”
Controlling? What are you talking about… 
I just laughed awkwardly, and he changed the subject.
“Oh, but what was it you wanted to talk to me about?”
“Oh, nothing special. I just have a few questions I want to ask. It’s been a while, right?”
A game of truth, taking turns…
Why am I always in this kind of situation? 
I don’t know, but I agreed to his suggestion.
“Can I go first?”
“Yes, go ahead.”
Okay, I’ve got the advantage now…
I started with easy questions. Or rather, not easy questions, but camouflage questions to hide my true purpose.
“First, is the Baekho famous in the city… you?”
“Ah… I guess you know now.”
Baekho didn’t deny it.  I mean, he’d been walking around openly using his name, so it was obvious.
“Hyung is pretty good, you know? I’m not that famous.”
“Alright, your turn now.”
After my turn, Baekho asked cautiously,
“…What was your relationship with Hyun-byeol unni, really?”
The question took the wind out of my sails.
“Why are you so curious about that?”
“I mean, wouldn’t you be curious? What else would I be curious about?”
Baekho raised his voice in a playful tone.  But I knew this guy too well to let his demeanor fool me. 
“She was my ex-girlfriend.”
He jumped up as soon as I answered honestly.
“I knew it! I knew it! I felt it from the moment I saw you!”
The question-and-answer session continued.  He asked if I knew that the Noark players had gone outside the walls, or if I knew about the rumor that Auril Gaviss was alive, etc.
I threw him some heavy questions, but he kept asking frivolous questions in return. Like this: 
“How did you end up dating someone like Hyun-byeol unni? Did you make the first move?”
Is this guy seriously asking these questions just to ask them?  The thought crossed my mind, but I didn’t show it. I slowly increased the weight of my questions. 
“What is it with you? You’re so nosy about me. What about you? Do you have a girlfriend? You’ve been living here for over ten years.  Thinking about it, dating is one thing, but you could have even gotten married if you wanted to.”
“Ahaha, hyungnim, that’s a bit too far!”
“Oh… sorry… but I’m just curious. Are you really single?”
“Well… it hasn’t worked out.”
“Really? Because you’re an NPC?”
“You could say that… I guess.”
“Hey, you’re giving me a serious look all of a sudden. It’s weird.”
“…”
“Tsk, you’re stubborn in the wrong places, aren’t you? Think about it carefully.  Marriage was just a joke, but you could at least try to date someone.”
“Hm… I’ll think about it.”
“Yeah, try to find someone close by. You said you have a female colleague, right?”
“Ah, Misha Kalstain, you mean?”
“Yeah, that’s it, I think.”
“Hhmm….”
Baekho stared at me for a moment before asking,
“But how do you even know her, hyung?”
It was a question within my prediction range.
“That? I heard about her from the Round Table’s Sentinels you introduced me to. They said you used her to spread rumors about Bjorn Jandel being an Evil Spirit…”
“So?”
“I’m suddenly a bit curious.”
I asked with a hint of caution.
“If that’s true… why did you do it?”
It was one of the many questions I wanted to ask him, now or never. Why did Baekho do something like that?
“I didn’t think you would do something that would harm a fellow player.”
After adding that explanation naturally, I waited patiently for his answer. And then…
“Hyung.”
Baekho finally spoke. 
“It’s my turn now.”
“…What?”
“My question was if you were single.”
Oh… it’s like that?
“So it’s my turn now.”
“….Okay, then go ahead.”
Baekho stared intently at me and sighed, his expression troubled. 
“Ah, it’s because it’s you, hyung? I really don’t like this. This is something you’re supposed to do with enemies.”
The change in atmosphere was so sudden.  Before I could even process it, Baekho continued.
“Hyung, let’s stop testing each other.”
“…Testing?”
There’s a problem with that statement. 
It’s one thing to say I’m testing him, but…
‘Testing…each other?’
So you were testing me too?
Thump, my heart beat ominously.  My thoughts raced, my brain overloaded with blood flow, making time seem to slow down.
Baekho had tested me.
About what?
It’s obvious.
Where did it start?
I have a hunch.
What did I miss?
It doesn’t matter.
What matters is the choice I make now.
What do I do from here?
‘It’s fine, the order just changed.’
I focused all my brainpower to gather my thoughts. As soon as I finished processing the situation…
“Ugh, that sound of a brain turning.”
I forced myself back into reality.
“Hyung.”
Baekho was talking.
He spoke in a calm voice, unlike someone about to strike at someone’s weakness.
“Are you really Bjorn Jandel?”
He asked, and after a brief pause, I answered.
“Yes.”
