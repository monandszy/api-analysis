## Chapter 359: Interrogation (1)
The Witch of Screams, Rilanne Vivienne.  As she slowly descended to the ground, she cried out the moment her feet touched the earth.
“Necrapeto! Are you crazy? Why did you let them go?”
Her hysterical voice made the man, whose flesh was only beginning to grow back on his bones, frown. 
"But I’m older than you, you know…"
"Ha!  Is that what matters now? Tell me why you just let those bastards go! If Commander Oppa finds out, she'll be furious!"
Vivienne pointed her finger towards a spot, her voice laced with irritation. Only a faded magic circle remained, devoid of its former glow.
The man, exasperated, retorted.
"Well, why should I be the one to get scolded? Asking me to engage in close combat against a necromancer is a ridiculous request, and besides, Vivienne saw it too, didn’t she?”
The woman, who had been so quick to attack, flinched at his unexpectedly sharp response. However, she seemed to have a point she absolutely needed to press. 
“…But you didn’t even use the Call of the Underworld!”
Vivienne clung to the core equipment of the Corpse Collector, the very instrument in question. 
However…
"Why would I use that?"
The man could only react with a disbelieving scoff.
"Because if you had, the Beacon Keeper wouldn't have been taken!"
It wasn’t a wrong statement. It was true that if he had used the Underworld Staff, a double-number item of the highest rank, he could have separated the man who had charged like a runaway train from the battlefield. 
But…
“Using that means one of us has to die to return. And you’re asking me to use it on someone we know nothing about?  If I left him alone, I could have survived 100%? ”
“…But you did get a new ability.”
“If that gets out, the royal family will develop a counter-strategy against me, for what purpose? If I’m in danger and need to rely on that ability, will Vivienne come to rescue me because of this incident?  Huh?”
“......”
"Please, respect the line. Your reason for not using magic isn’t so different from mine."
Vivienne could only clench her jaw as the man began to launch into a full-fledged argument. Every word pierced her heart, after all. 
The truth was, she had not actively tried to stop that monstrous man for the same reason. 
Because of a lack of information. 
And because he had been hit with a spell and retaliated, she was hesitant to use even more powerful magic.
“Ugh, this is so frustrating…."
In the end, the blame for defeat fell on everyone. 
Even though they belonged to the same group and worked together, the fundamental truth remained unchanged. 
There was no one here noble enough to sacrifice themselves for others. Everyone was more sensitive to their own gains and losses than to the danger their comrades faced. 
“…Are you all alright?”
As Vivienne was suppressing her anger, her lips chapped with irritation, the Blood Knight returned and rejoined the group. The old man, with one arm gone, seemed the most pitiful of the three. 
But…
"If Grandpa had done things right, it would have been fine, right?"
Vivienne, seemingly unconcerned with the matter, changed her target to the Blood Knight.
“......?”
"You shouldn't have tried to stop that monster, you should have gone after the rearguard!"
It was not simply a statement meant to pick on him; she genuinely thought that way. 
“Why are you even doing useless things when you can’t even stop them anyway…."
If he had focused on attacking the enemy instead of trying to stop that man, the situation would have been different.
Wasn't the monstrous man, who had been protecting his comrades by taking all sorts of attacks barehanded, the first to deviate from their formation?
“If you kill the Blood Spirit Marquis, one of the Seven Pillars, that’s a huge accomplishment. The Golden Magician is another matter. She's not only one of the targets for this ambush but also because if she dies, her teleportation magic will be disabled.”
The Blood Knight’s judgment was a miscalculation. 
The man, genuinely impressed by such a direct statement, let out a gasp of surprise.
“Wow, you… blaming Grandpa here? You're even more trashy than I thought. Saying such things to someone who tried to protect us.”
“…Why, can’t you even say your thoughts?  It’s not wrong, is it?”
"Well, I mean, it's true.  Psh."
The man nodded, glancing at the Blood Knight. 
He became prey for the hyenas, but surprisingly, the old knight offered no excuses.  He simply mumbled in a monotone voice.
“Contact, the Commander… Golden… Magician… lost.”
“…Grandpa, can’t you do it?”
The Blood Knight responded with a cold stare to Vivienne’s question, and she eventually lowered her head.
The target was lost. 
Not only that, but the Beacon Keeper, considered a valuable resource even within Orcullis, was attacked. 
And yet they had only watched as the attackers vanished through teleportation. 
Because if they had intervened, they would only have been the ones to suffer.
“......"
How can you even say something like that?
Just as she was hesitating, the Corpse Collector urged her. 
"I know how you feel, but please contact the Commander first.  There’s some information we need to convey, even if it’s not about the Golden Magician.”
“…Are you talking about that monstrous guy?”
“That too, but…."
The man trailed off, then continued.
"Anyway, tell her.  I don’t know why they were here, but…."
“......”
"Amelia Rainwells… I found her."
***
「Arua Raven has activated the 4th-grade spatial magic [Multiple Teleportations].」
When the light emitted from the activated magic circle faded, the first thing that caught my eye was a steel cage.
“Just stay put.  We’re not in the wrong place.”
“…What are you talking about?”
“It’s a facility that’s on every warship. If someone uses spatial teleportation, they’re automatically routed here to prevent intruders.” 
Ah, so there was something like that installed. 
But, teleportation redirection?  That sounds familiar somehow…
"I am Arua Raven, Vice Commander of the 3rd Magic Legion. This is my ID card. I have returned after teleporting during battle against Orcullis criminals."
Raven revealed her identity to the soldier waiting outside the cage, and shortly after the identity verification was complete, the cage opened. 
But…
Chukkerung-!
What? Why are you letting yourself out and closing it again?
“…What are you doing?”
Before I could even ask in a polite tone, Raven, avoiding my gaze, spoke to the soldier.
"Keep an eye on them for a while, okay?”
"Yes."
Oh… I didn’t expect this kind of development?
Just as my mind went blank, Erwen next to me clung to the cage, shaking the bars.
“…I’ll kill you!!”
It was a bit too much to simply call it a loss of control, but I’m on the verge of losing it too.  
Something about it reminds me of the guild basement, and I want to break through the cage right now. 
But…
“I understand how you feel, but please stay calm.  You can’t escape by force anyway.”
“…What? 
 
“No. 399 Silent Cage.  Inside, not only are your abilities sealed, but you can’t use magic, divine power, or aura.”
Hah, I had a bad feeling about this.  
I sighed, letting go of the cage I had been clutching as I confirmed that even when I recited the command, no skills were being activated.
"Here, this is a potion.  Please use it to heal your wounds."
Raven handed me several potions through the cage, then instructed the soldier on a few things before leaving. 
To summarize the important points:
Treat them with respect.
Don’t open the cage under any circumstances.
If the enemy invades this far, release them so we can take care of the situation.
“…We’ve been caught. Tersia, don’t waste your energy, come here.”
"What?  That woman locked us up here, what are we supposed to do-!"
"What else would you do?”
“......”
"Erwen, he’s right.  Let’s stay calm for now and come over here."
"………Yes.”
I quickly regained my composure and spoke, and Erwen, giving up her stubbornness, went over to my side.
"First… we should use these potions.”
If we relied on natural regeneration, it would take a while to heal, so with Amelia and Erwen's help, I immediately started spraying potions all over my body to stop the bleeding.  
How long had it been?
“…Are you okay?”
“…Yeah, it’s familiar now.”
To be honest, I feel like dying.  My pain resistance now only consists of the +30 from the Baion core.
But what can I do? I have to heal these wounds.
“Hey, could you give us some water, please?”
"Ah… Ah, okay!"
Erwen asked the soldier in a pleading tone, and he hurriedly brought us water.  He seems hesitant to approach us, probably because of Erwen’s status, but also because of Raven’s instructions to treat us with respect. 
"Uh… are you alright?”
Ah, he’s just worried about me.
"I’m getting more sweat than blood, it seems…."
“I’m fine, don't worry.”
It’s always been like this whenever I drink potions. 
I chugged down the water the kind soldier gave me in one gulp, then moved closer to the cage across from the entrance. 
We need to talk about private matters now. 
"Anyway, now that we’re healed, let’s talk. Both of you, come closer.  And keep your voices down.”
"You’re a bit too close, don’t you think?”
"What's wrong with that? It’s to have a conversation."
“…Then, me too…."
“Hmm, fairies have good hearing, don’t they?”
"Wh, what’s it to you?”
“It was just a statement—”
Ugh, why are they like this?
"Both of you, stop it. Now’s not the time for this.”
"Yes……."
Before our conversation went off track again, I quickly brought it back to the main topic.
“What do you think Raven did that for?”
Why did Raven lock us up in this place?
The two, who had been arguing, immediately agreed on this point.
"She must have realized your identity."
"Yeah, that’s the only possibility.  She knows you’re an evil spirit, you know… *Clack clack*, after saving your life countless times, she's ungrateful."
Does Erwen have murderous intent in her blood now? 
I don’t know, but I’m worried about Erwen’s teeth.  I brought up the next most likely possibility, since I don’t want to think about it.
“Amelia, what’s the chance that she did this because she knows your identity?”
“Well, it’s not impossible, either. That woman was on that island, too.”
Raven and Amelia are familiar with each other. They fought side-by-side on Parune Island, and she knows about Amelia’s [Abyssal Power], [Self-Replication], and [Suragak].
But, adding daggers to that?  
Even if two years have passed and she’s covering her face, Raven would have noticed.
"To be sure…  she might suspect we’re working for them because of you.  Ugh, I knew it.”
"Wait, what did you know?”
“What else?  That you’ll only cause trouble for Commander.”
“Heh, you’re pretty talkative for someone who can’t even control their own mind.”
"Wh… ?"
No, why is our conversation going like this again?
I quickly changed the topic.
“Alright, Amelia, are you okay?  It’s highly likely that the Noirque people recognized you too.”
“That…  they probably did.  The Blood Knight probably didn’t recognize me because we never interacted, but the Corpse Collector definitely saw me.”
Well, I feel bad about that. 
I thought she was living in hiding after changing her identity, but now she’s an enemy of both the royal family and Noirque.
"Don’t worry too much about it. It's something we expected. If they start to cause trouble, I’ll leave."
“You still have some conscience left, I see?”
"Unlike you, I have some reason.”
Ugh, again, again, again.
If we make a mistake now, we’re all doomed.
No, will Erwen be okay in the worst-case scenario?  
I’ll be a target for the royal family, and Amelia might be considered a Noirque spy, but Erwen won’t be.  
Even in the worst case, the fairies will protect her. 
“…What are we supposed to do now?”
Amelia’s question made me stop and think for a moment before answering.
“Well, there’s nothing we can do but wait.”
There’s not much we can do locked up in a cage.  The best we can do is wait until Raven returns and see how the situation unfolds.  
Therefore...
"Commander?"
I wrapped up the conversation and got up.  Then, I walked over to the corpse, whose face was covered with the cloth the soldier gave me along with the water. 
I don’t know what will happen in the future, but... 
It's better to do what we can.
“…What are you doing?”
“Checking loot.”
“…What? Right now?”
Well, what else can I do?
I shrugged, then squatted down and started looting the corpse. 
‘Ten rings, a necklace, the staff got lost when I grabbed it before….’
I think I can open my dimensional space later when we get out of the cage. 
This cage prevents magical tools from working inside.
‘Wow, this is worth a lot of money, though?’
It's important to be able to smile even in difficult situations. 
I can’t estimate the exact amount of money I’ve earned, but one thing is certain.  
If I sell all this, I’ll be able to pay off my debts.
Well, the question is whether I can get out of here with all this.
