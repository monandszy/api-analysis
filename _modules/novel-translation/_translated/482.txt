## Chapter 482: The Big Catch (5)
The moment the [Veil of Betrayal] reactivated, my teammates vanished from my sight.
Crackle—
The shell encasing Dreadfear shattered, revealing the creature once more. Its skin resembled waxy flesh, a single, oversized eye dominating a featureless face, its proportions defying any sense of balance. In both hands, it clutched a colossal bone greatsword. 
Its appearance was the same as before it activated its [Protection Mechanism], though this similarity proved fleeting. 
“Hatred intensifies.”
A buff granted upon the creature’s recovery from its stunned state. It’s all down to luck from here…
“Memories etched onto bone deepen.”
Well, at least this is a standard buff, right?
Screech—
Spikes sprouted from the greatsword Dreadfear clutched. This was the weapon buff out of the five possible buffs it could receive in its third phase.
‘I’ll have to be extra careful.’
Since it was a damage enhancement buff, I had to adapt my battle strategy accordingly. 
Boom!
I remained focused on defense with my shield, but I avoided relying on my body to absorb blows completely.  The weapon buff presented a challenge, even for me.
Exactly like this.
“Sharp thorns pierce the character's body.”
“Continuously drains the character's soul power.”
The sword now boasted an MP absorption option, which stacked with each hit. But, there was a catch.
“The more MP drained, the more Dreadfear’s hatred increases.”
Weapon, armor, even its eye – every buff in the third phase contributed to Dreadfear’s “Hatred” level. Once this level reached its peak, the creature gained a particularly troublesome bonus buff.
‘If Hatred triggers, the raid is effectively failed.’
If it came to that, survival, not the raid, would be the primary concern. Therefore…
Whoosh—
Evade by retreating whenever a blow was unavoidable.
Tap, tap.
But rather than simply retreating, I focused on utilizing the terrain, circling the creature while keeping it in the center of the area.
“Dreadfear has used [Inner Mirror].”
“Inflicts fixed damage proportionate to lowered mental stats.”
I endured the unavoidable, instant-cast skill with gritted teeth.
“Dreadfear has used [Memories of the Dead].”
Bombs floating like soap bubbles in the air were dealt with thanks to Vercil’s assistance.
“Vercil Goul’land has cast the 6th-tier summoning spell [Life Doll].”
Having placed dummy figures around the area, I could prevent the creature from focusing its attacks on a single target.
[Kyaaah—!]
Time passed as we fought with all our might, meticulously following the raid strategy.
‘… I think it’s almost time.’
Wasn’t it time?
Just as that thought crossed my mind…
“The light of trust drives away the fear within.”
“The [Veil of Betrayal] is temporarily lifted.”
As a brilliant white light bathed the dark cave, Dreadfear howled in pain, covering itself with the shell once more.
“Dreadfear has used [Protection Mechanism].”
If we failed to break through this shell again, the creature would receive another buff, making the fight even more difficult. However, I wasn’t overly concerned.
“Erwen.”
Honestly, Dreadfear was practically ready for its final exam at this point.
“Erwen Fornach di Tercia summons [Dark Spirit King Dicloe].”
It was time to move onto the final phase. 
***
Dreadfear, the Lord of Terror.
It’s a cursed tier boss, where even a thirty-person raid hardly yielded significant rewards. It’s usually only hunted for clan level-up trials. However, this creature has a hidden element.
Well, it’s not exactly hidden, it’s a well-known fact in the city, spread through the tales of old heroes. 
[If five players manage to defeat Dreadfear, they will obtain incredible rewards.]
Of course, there are two inaccuracies in this information.  First, it’s not about precisely having five players, but rather less than five.
‘And the rewards are not that incredible either.’
It’s simply a matter of receiving the usual rewards, though perhaps slightly better. But the rumors are exaggerated for a reason.
[If you succeed, it will be the tenth achievement after the last Grand Sage.]
Teams succeeding in a five-person clear are extremely rare.
Those who have succeeded have all left their mark in history.
Rimelin, the Abyss Seeker.
Armela, the Fairy Queen.
Mulmarin, the Slayer of Sea Dragons.
These legendary explorers, referred to as the great explorers, all shared one thing in common. This was enough to ignite the desire for achievement in subsequent explorers, and countless people followed in their footsteps, summoning the Lord of Terror.
Most, however, never returned.
‘It’s only natural. How many bosses can you defeat on your first try?’
I was only able to decipher the raid strategy because I had experienced it countless times through games. Had I been thrown into it without any prior knowledge, the outcome would have been the same.
Reality and games are different.
There is only one chance to try.  If you fail, it’s game over, and even the memory of failure doesn’t give you another chance.
‘… I’m actually curious how the previous teams cleared it.’
What strategy did they use? Did they use the same method I did? Or did they simply crush it with overwhelming stats?  I’ll never know.
All ten teams that successfully defeated Dreadfear have remained silent about their strategies. 
‘I don’t understand this either….’
It’s an explorer’s habit to keep high-level information exclusive, preventing its release to the public. But these guys, who received the title of heroes for creating a free map of the sixth floor and openly sharing information about the uncharted tenth floor, why keep this a secret?
‘… Well, it’s not something I need to worry about now.’
Hmm… Is it?
Something feels weird all of a sudden.
Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!
As I pondered the cause of this inexplicable sensation, I received a notification.
“The [Protection Mechanism] of Dreadfear has been lifted.”
The thick shell shattered, black mist pouring out from the cracks.
As a result, I gave an order.
“Stop.”
Any further attacks would be a waste of MP. We need to conserve it as much as possible.
“Good job. It must have been tough.”
“Yes… ”
“Gather around everyone!”
I gathered my teammates behind me, preparing for the impact.
[Kyaaah—!!]
Black mist seeped out with a scratching sound like that of a chalkboard. As the mist thinned, blood-red eyes gleamed through the cracks in the shell.
‘Those eyes! Such malice!’
Taking a deep breath, I faced the creature.
“Dreadfear feels a grave threat from you.”
We had arrived at the introduction of the fourth phase.  It was the most significant turning point of the raid.
Thump, thump.
Dreadfear slowly emerged from the shell it had hidden in.
It started as maggots, then black mist, and finally a creature covered in waxy flesh, now taking the form of a human.
Thump.
Pale skin covered in blue veins. Ribs and bones protruded from its emaciated arms and legs.  Ash-grey hair cascaded down, and now it had a nose, eyes, and a mouth.
Unfortunately, they weren’t arranged in the proper order, like someone randomly placed them.
Yeah, this was definitely a humanoid monster, right?
Roll.
A single eyeball, attached to its chin, rolled around.
Click.
Blood flowed from the nose in the position where the right eye should have been.
Whirr—
The bone greatsword attached to its hand dragged across the floor, making a grating noise.
Thump, thump.
The creature, drenched in a viscous liquid, like something just born out of amniotic fluid.
Thump.
It stopped, then slowly surveyed us.
[Kieee—!]
It roared, opening its mouth, which was positioned where its nose should have been.
“There are less than five characters within the radius.”
“Special condition – [Old Memories] fulfilled.”
“The terror felt within Dreadfear is reawakened.”
The five-person clear condition was met, of course.
“The fragments of memories that emerged begin to twist the surrounding space.”
Okay, now we go to the special five-person clear map, finish the raid, and that’s it…
Flash!
A blinding flash of light momentarily caused my vision to flicker.
“……”
I froze in place. 
“… What’s going on? Where am I?”
I was confronted with a field I had never seen before. 
***
“The character is in a state of ‘Goblin Paralysis Poison’.”
“Special condition – [Distorted Memories] fulfilled.”
“The character will be transferred to the Pilgrim’s Cave.”
***
Hans… Hans Del’bain…
Amelia paused her interrogation, her thoughts consumed by the name, which seemed increasingly ominous.
But this pause was fleeting. 
‘… Nothing bad will happen.’
He had eaten the Essence of Quiet from the leader of Orculis more than three hundred times, hadn’t he? The guy had confidently assured her that everything would be okay, so there would be no accidents.
Right, so…
‘Focus on my job.’
She dismissed her concerns, returning to the interrogation. She had only just gotten the guy talking, and if he clammed up again, it would be a disaster.
“Where do you live?”
“……. Ninth district.”
“Have you ever met Count Al’miners?”
“……..No.”
She continued to ask questions, and whenever she sensed a lie, she would inflict punishment without a word. And for how long did this continue?
“I, really……. I was just given an order on the black market, that’s all. I don’t know who gave the order… I swear…”
Suddenly, a realization struck her.
This statement was the truth.  Any further information could not be gleaned, even through interrogation.
‘… In the end, I failed to find any connection to Count Al’miners.’
He’ll be disappointed when he finds out about this.
A sense of melancholy washed over her, but Amelia was an expert at controlling her emotions.
It was a shame, but what could she do?
It was better to find something else she could do with the time she’d wasted being disappointed.
“……”
After that, Amelia carefully checked the man’s possessions again, just in case she had missed something.  She then noticed a peculiar detail.
‘…Paralysis Poison?’
The weapon used to stab the man was coated with poison.  Tasting it, she realized it was a low-grade poison based on goblin venom.
‘Why use this…?’
The more she thought about it, the more perplexing it became.
For a Guardian of his caliber, a low-grade poison like this would be utterly ineffective.  But he used this?
When there were so many other potent and deadly poisons available?
“Why use Goblin Paralysis Poison?”
“Paralysis Poison……?”
The man responded as if he knew nothing, making Amelia even more suspicious.
“I… I never used any Paralysis Poison.  Why, why would I use that?”
Amelia turned her gaze to the other man. He had been silent from the start, his eyes fixed on empty space with a look of resignation.
“……”
Amelia quickly checked the other man’s weapon as well.  Amazingly, his weapon was also coated with Paralysis Poison.
And the moment she realized that…
Flash!
A flash of light emanated from the center of the cave, where the battle had been raging, and then silence fell.  This meant her teammates had moved onto the next stage.
Amelia summoned a clone and sent it to the empty cavern.
There were four corpses lying in the cave.  Their weapons were also coated with Goblin Paralysis Poison.
Was it a coincidence?
No, impossible. 
‘Something…’.
Something ominous was happening.
Driven by an instinctive sense of foreboding, Amelia grabbed the other man by the collar.
“… Tell me. Why did you coat your weapon with Goblin Paralysis Poison?”
“……”
True to his character, who remained silent even under brutal torture, he didn’t respond.
Swoosh!
Amelia drew her dagger and pointed it at the man’s throat.
Push.
Blood poured out immediately as she pressed down on the dagger.  However, the man’s expression remained unchanged.  Before, he had seemed simply resigned, but now his expression seemed different.
“Who… are you?”
The man finally opened his mouth in response to her question.
“I don’t know.”
His answer came nonchalantly.
As Amelia pressed the dagger deeper, pushing with even more force…
Crack!
The dagger flew away as if some unknown force had repelled it.
Thump, thump.
The man, who had been lying on the floor, rose to his feet, brushing off his knees.
“That guy has a good woman as a teammate. Even without directly confronting her, she’s managed to get this far with her suspicions. With her intuition, she’ll be a huge help to him in the remaining journey.”
His words made no sense to Amelia.
She narrowed her eyes, letting out a murderous aura.
“……. Who are you? What’s your purpose?”
“Seeing you worry about him even in this situation, I doubt she’ll betray him easily…”
The man looked down at Amelia with a scrutinizing air, a smirk playing on his lips.
“Don’t look at me like that. I’m merely guiding him towards his destiny.”
“……”
“You know? Bjorn Jan’del has a remarkable destiny. He grows stronger through trials.”
The man tapped Amelia’s shoulder.
“For instance, if the mage hadn’t died in the maze that day, do you think he would have become the hero he is today? The guy whose primary concern was survival, even if it meant he had to do it alone?”
No, that’s impossible.
The man chuckled as he added.
“So don’t worry. He’ll be fine this time too.”
Amelia gripped the remaining dagger, ready for a surprise attack at any moment.
“So, what’s your reason for telling me all this?”
Even as she asked the question, her gaze constantly scanned for any weakness in the man.
But.
“It’s simple. I’m being kind.”
She couldn’t find any opening.
“Amelia Rain’wayl’s.”
His clear voice echoed in her ears.
“You were easily fooled by illusion magic even before.”
“……!”
“Get some rest.”
Even as the man’s fingertip touched her forehead…
