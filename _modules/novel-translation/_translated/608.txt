## Chapter 608: Mystery (1)
A horse racing across the sky, not during the rainy season.
The village chief’s book of strange tales didn’t mention a horse emitting such a brilliant light, but nonetheless…
With such a sudden encounter, I needed to make a quick decision.
Of course, the book did mention that as long as I didn't attack or get too close, nothing bad would happen…
‘But that doesn’t mean I have to let it go, right?’
To be honest, the moment I saw it, my mouth watered.
Was it like witnessing a legendary monster?
‘What should I do?’
The village chief had warned me about it, so it must be quite dangerous.
But for such a formidable beast, the rewards would be great if I managed to hunt it down.
That’s the law of [Dungeon and Stone].
Great risks always come with commensurate rewards.
“Hey! It’s getting away!”
“Don’t we need to do something? It must be a new kind of monster!”
“Everyone, stay at your posts and await my orders!”
Finally, I made my decision.
Perhaps it held the key to escape, a secret even the village chief didn't know…
‘For now, let’s let it go.’
Today is a bad day for a confrontation, a bad time and place.
We’re not on land, and our forces are scattered across four ships.
We don’t know enough about its threat yet. It makes more sense to prepare ourselves fully and launch a raid in a more suitable location.
Therefore…
Chik- chik.
I held the message stone as if gripping a radio, and spoke.
“Do not engage the monster in the sky. This is the Commander’s order.”
The Barbarian Commander’s orders, delivered to all the leaders on each ship.
Needless to say, no member of the expedition dared to disobey this order.
Thuk.
I stood at the bow of the ship, watching the horse’s disappearing silhouette and savoring the anticipation.
“Tch.”
But I’m sure we’ll meet again someday.
***
One of Lapdonia’s tidbits of information:
99.9% of the currency in this world is released into circulation through the Dimensional Square checkpoints.
That’s why it’s called ‘Stone’.
A coin worth 100 Stone has the value of that much magic stone.
And this means…
Swaaa- swaaa- swaaa- swaaa- swaaa-!
We’re consuming around 500,000 Stone per hour. We’re running the arcane engineering propulsion systems at full power throughout the entire voyage.
Oh, and this figure is per ship.
“Spending all this money definitely makes us incredibly fast.”
Even the sea monsters we occasionally encounter don’t dare to approach the ship.
“Auyen, how long do you think it will take to reach our destination?”
“I estimate we’ll cut the travel time in half, Commander.”
A month’s journey has been reduced to half a month.
Well, if we hadn’t gone back to the Library Island from where we found the stone door…
‘What’s the point in regretting it now?’
But thanks to the fully operational engines, we’ve reduced the detour to just a few days.
Of course, the magic stone consumption has been immense.
“Hahaha! Did you see? We’ve already burnt through over a million Stone! Ah, with four ships, it’s 3.78 million Stone, right?!”
“…It’s 4 million Stone, Pnelin.”
“………Hahaha! This is quite fun!”
Ainar, in charge of assisting with the voyage, was thrilled. With every order from Auyen, she slammed more magic stones into the arcane engineering propulsion system.
It seems she finds using money like water quite amusing.
Of course, there were those who found the magic stone consumption a bit too much.
“You said half a month until we reach the destination…?”
“With four ships, how much is that?”
“I don’t know for sure, but I imagine it’s enough to buy a decent mansion in the city.”
“Whoa… ”
I felt the same way, to be honest.
We were using the magic stones brought from the exploration team that entered the dungeon’s first basement level, but watching them disappear was heartbreaking.
But it was a necessary choice.
The less time we spend going to Rainbow Island, the better.
“Is it because of the rainy season? Why are we in such a rush?”
“It’s definitely because of that. If it takes a month to get there, the rainy season will start again soon.”
Our destination, Rainbow Island, is shrouded in mystery.
Therefore, we need to secure as much exploration time as possible that doesn’t overlap with the rainy season.
“That makes me even more curious. What did you do down there by yourself? I can tell, Mr. Yandel, that it’s more important to you than saving time.”
“Ah, well…”
I hesitated for a moment before explaining the existence of Hamsik, whom Raven didn’t know yet. I told her I had brought him out with me.
“You mean that monster appeared from the rift? And you thought you might need his help?”
“…You could say that, in a way.”
“Hmm…”
Raven just looked at me with a strange expression and remained silent for a while.
“Oh, right. Speaking of secrets…”
“‘Speaking of?’”
“That crown, I finally decided on a name for it.”
Ah, finally.
I thought she was just keeping it to herself since she hadn't told me even after days.
“What is it?”
“……The Crown of Anguish.”
Raven revealed the name with a hint of shyness, and even offered an unsolicited explanation for the name.
She said that while it had the effect of mental immunity, it came with significant restrictions. So, one would have to think carefully before wearing it?
“…What do you think?”
To be honest, I don’t know.
If she had gone through so much anguish trying to find a name for it, I would have just taken it as it is.
“Good.”
“Heh, right? So, as promised, can I publicly release this? You have to use this name and mention that I gave it to you. Oh, and that I’m the researcher, of course.”
“Understood.”
I gave her a firm reply, and Raven disappeared, seemingly satisfied. From then on, the voyage continued without any particular incidents.
Most of the time, I spent talking with my companions. In my spare time, I patrolled the ship or conducted experiments with Hamsik in my cabin.
“Hamsik, how have you been?”
[……Send me back.]
“Today’s experiment is on flashbacks. They say when people are in mortal danger, they recall memories they thought they’d forgotten—.”
[No! I won’t do it. Absolutely not!]
He’s so sensitive.
He was so enthusiastic when I was testing him on various things at first.
“Hmm, has he completely given up after all these failures?”
Hamsik exploded into a frenzy as I muttered those words in an analytical tone.
[Beep—!!!]
This is Hamsik’s cute howling when he’s genuinely angry.
Of course, everyone else finds it terrifying.
When I brought Raven into the cabin a while back, her face turned pale, and she ran away.
“Don’t get upset. The flashback experiment is just for fun. Ah, I brought some things you’ll like today.”
I pulled out a few books I received from Raven, and Hamsik’s face brightened instantly.
‘Ugh, it’s like raising a child.’
Ancient language books Hamsik can read, even though he can only speak Ancient Language.
They weren’t even story books.
But Hamsik seemed to enjoy them more than anything else. He read the books intently, and I lay down on the bed beside him and rested.
And…
One day, two days, three days, four days…
How long did that continue?
Ainar visited my cabin while I was resting.
“B-b-b-iyoorn!!!”
“It’s Commander, not Biyoorn—.”
“Auyen says we’ll reach our destination in an hour, so come out.”
Ah, finally.
The moment I needed to re-tighten my relaxed nerves.
***
I headed to the navigation room and found Auyen, her eyes focused on the map as she held the wheel.
“Ah, Commander. You’ve arrived.”
My navigator, the only one among the members of Clan Anabada who always calls me Commander.
“Ainar said we’d be arriving soon?”
“Yes, that’s right.”
“Are you sure? You said it would be this afternoon yesterday.”
“Due to the strong winds blowing from a certain point, I had to recalculate.”
Winds…
Come to think of it, my hair was whipping around the moment I stepped out onto the deck.
I went to the railing to check below. The currents were stronger than before.
[If the waves start crashing during the rainy season, stop your journey immediately and find shelter.]
The words from the book of strange tales came to mind, but it couldn’t be referring to this.
It’s not even the rainy season yet.
The currents are rough, but they’re not crashing against the ship, at least not yet.
“So, are you confident in your calculations?”
“Yes. I double-checked several times, factoring in the changing speed.”
“If you say so. Good work.”
After Auyen’s report, I used the message stone to order all the warships to prepare for all possibilities as we would soon be arriving at our destination.
“Erwen! Is it still not here?”
“No! I still can’t see anything!”
We’re nearing the destination, but Erwen, stationed in the lookout tower, can’t see a single thing.
“…….”
We had been slowly reducing speed. Suddenly, the wind stopped, and we entered a windless zone.
At the same time, the ship also stopped.
The arcane engineering propulsion system allowed the ship to move even without wind, so why was it stopping? The reason was simple.
“We’ve arrived, Commander.”
We had reached our destination.
“Are you sure this is it?”
“I can’t be sure if this is where I saw the pillar of light that day… but I’m certain this is the location on the map.”
“Hmm…”
I don’t doubt Auyen’s words or her skills.
We rescued her while she was hunting raiders, but she’s a navigator with skills even experienced naval navigators would admire.
If she’s this certain, it must be true.
And right after we got here, the wind that was blowing so strongly stopped completely, leaving us in a windless zone.
We need to shift our perspective.
We’ve arrived at the right place.
But we can’t see anything for another reason.
For example…
“It must be one of two things.”
“…Yes?”
“It’s either below the sea or floating above.”
“Ah…”
No one objected to my words.
After all, there are islands like this in the 6th basement level of the ocean.
The subterranean island where the Deep Sea Giant appeared, and the Storm Cloud Island, which we haven’t explored yet due to time constraints and priorities.
“Let’s check below the sea first.”
It’s likely that something is hidden below, if there is anything at all.
After all, the map of the first basement level is just the sea, isn’t it?
Thinking that, I ordered the anchor to be lowered to check the depth.
However…
“Commander! The anchor won’t reach even after releasing the entire rope!”
How deep is it, for the anchor not to touch the bottom?
This is getting even more suspicious.
“…It seems we have no choice but to go down ourselves.”
I formed a Special Task Force, selecting a few individuals with outstanding abilities. One by one, they put on the oxygen tanks (magicians) and dived into the ocean.
I wanted to go down myself, but…
“Absolutely not!”
The First Officer’s outburst made me give up.
He said it was inconceivable for the Commander to do such a dangerous thing, and that the expedition had been entrusted with talents directly recruited by the royal family, so I should have faith in them.
“You didn’t seem to mind sending the Earl into the rift.”
“Yes. And our expedition lost its commander for a while that day.”
“Uh…”
I have nothing to say to that.
Maybe it’s because he confessed to not liking positions of responsibility last time?
I wonder what his real reason for stopping me is.
‘It’s a shame I can’t explore myself, but at least my body is safe.’
The first deep-sea exploration was completed while I was simply sitting on the ship, waiting.
It was a failure.
There were no monsters swarming the ocean floor, and no other obstacles. But…
“…Even after diving as deep as the oxygen tanks (magicians) allowed, we couldn’t reach the bottom.”

“…Even after diving as deep as the oxygen tanks (magicians) allowed, we couldn’t reach the bottom.”
We didn’t even bother with a second exploration after that.
We decided there was no point in trying again; it wouldn’t change anything.
“Then we’ll have to check above.”
So, the discussion naturally concluded with an exploration of the sky first.
“Go, Exploration Team Leader!”
As soon as the magicians from the exploration team finished resting after the deep-sea dive, they used levitation magic and flew up.
“…I’m glad I chose research that time.”
Raven, who had come to my side, sighed in relief.
“I was suddenly curious, why is research called the Research Department Head, but exploration is called the Exploration Team Leader?”
“…You’re paying attention to strange things.”
“Did you just make up the names randomly?”
Not entirely, but I didn’t go through as much anguish as her when coming up with names.
“Never mind that, look above. If you fall, you’ll have to catch yourselves.”
“Okay.”
How much time passed while we watched the sky?
The Team Leader, unlike my worries, flew back safely with the exploration team, landing on the ship.
“The wind was too strong from about 200 meters above. It was impossible to go any higher.”
The first sky exploration was also a failure.
But unlike the deep-sea exploration, it wasn’t a complete failure.
“However… one of the team members said he thought he saw something above just before descending.”
If he wasn’t mistaken, there’s something up in the sky.
‘The question is how we get up there… ’
Time to unleash my gamer imagination.
