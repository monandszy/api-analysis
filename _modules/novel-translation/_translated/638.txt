## The Shame of a Nobleman 
I had never been a man who blushed easily.  Of course, that didn't mean I was a hero from a story, always finding the right answer and conquering every hardship with grace. I always strived for my best, but there were always things I regretted. I was a flawed, ordinary person. I was never ashamed of that. 
But today…
“Hah…”
I felt shame. 
Why did so many faces flash before my eyes when I heard the council's proposal? 
‘Am I truly insane?’
I didn't understand myself.  I lay in bed for hours, trying to make sense of it. 
‘Misha Kalstain.’
It was understandable that her face came to mind. She was the first person I formed a genuine bond with after I arrived in this world. 
‘Erwin Fornachi di Tersia.’
Erwin was different from Misha, though. While I felt a constant twinge of guilt, it was a feeling distinct from romantic love.  It was more likely her face flashed before my eyes because I knew how she felt about me. 
‘Amelia Rainwales.’
Ironically, Amelia, whom I’d first encountered as an enemy during my days as a Raider, was the most trustworthy person I knew. She was always strong and reliable, a pillar of support. And to be honest, she was quite adorable. 
But the problem was…
‘Why wasn’t it just those three?’
Raven, Hyunbyeol, and Ragnar.
And Ainar…
‘No, she's just a friend.’
Their faces, though fleeting compared to the first three, had also crossed my mind. Like a teenage boy fantasizing about a girl who smiles kindly, I pictured a life with each of them. 
Surprisingly, each scenario offered its own joys and pleasures. 
‘…Am I truly a madman?’
I couldn't understand myself. I didn’t want to be with any of them. It wasn’t impossible, since I was a nobleman now. But I simply didn’t want to. 
Then why did so many faces flash before my eyes at that moment?
After a long time lost in thought, I finally stumbled upon an answer that seemed the most logical. 
‘…Maybe it was inevitable.’
I hadn’t truly opened my heart to anyone yet.  After what happened with Misha, I’d suppressed and buried my feelings. In such a situation, it was natural to think of those closest to me when the topic of marriage arose. 
After all, they were the only women I knew. 
‘Yes, it’s not me who’s strange.’
It might just be a rationalization from another's perspective, but once I reached that conclusion, I felt a sense of peace. 
Therefore…
Drrruung! Drrruung! Drrruung!
I fell asleep without realizing it, and woke up the next morning. 
I sneaked out of the newly built building (an addition) where the tribal chief’s tent used to be. 
“You’re quite busy for this early in the morning.”
Oh…
“Ha ha, I was just going for a walk.”
I awkwardly laughed and glanced around as Amelia let out a chuckle. 
“Don’t worry, the others are nowhere near here. I persuaded them to leave and wait for you.”
“Oh… is that so…?”
“You’ll have to give a proper answer eventually. Everyone’s wondering what you’ll decide.”
Amelia said it like she’d been waiting to say that, and as soon as she finished, she turned and walked away.  
Was that cool, though? 
“And… I don’t know where you’re going today, but don’t be out too late. If you’re planning on staying out overnight, let us know in advance.” 
She turned to leave, then paused, turning back to give me that warning. It was like a mother nagging at her child. 
Well, it was part of her charm. 
‘Hah… how did I end up bringing up marriage at the dinner table…?’
That’s why people should be mindful of what they say.  The proverb says that one word can repay a thousand debts, but the opposite is also true. 
“It’s the tribal chief!”
“The tribal chief is leaving for the city!”
“Open the gates!”
I was just going for a stroll, but by the time I reached the gates, they had opened, and I found myself in the 7th District. 
The 7th District was still a wasteland, as reconstruction hadn’t begun in earnest. The residents were sprawled out like beggars, covered in blankets in front of their collapsed homes, and they all looked up at me when I appeared. 
“The giant! It’s the giant!”
“What? The baron is here?”
“Baron Yandel!”
Was it because of my hero status? People who would usually be terrified of a nobleman’s arrival approached me differently. 
It wasn’t all good, of course. 
It was fine when they just greeted me with words of thanks and blessings, but not everyone did. 
“Please! Help my family! My shop collapsed, and if this continues, next year’s taxes—!”
Begging or seeking sympathy was alright, but…
“Baron! Baron! What’s going to happen to our 7th District? Bifron! What about Bifron?!”
“I heard that the royal family will abandon the 7th District! Is it true?!”
Or demanding answers. 
“Just say something!”
Some even expected me to answer as if I were simply retrieving a lost item. 
‘…I understand their frustration.’
They were struggling day by day, and they didn’t have any proper information, so they felt frustrated. 
“Baron!”
“Don’t believe the rumors. Reconstruction will begin soon in the 7th District.”
“Baron!”
“Take this and hold on a little longer. I’ll do my best to get more relief supplies.”
“Baron!”
“The Bifron Barrier? What’s so scary about that? Don’t worry everyone! This city will never fall!”
Instead of getting angry at them, I offered words of encouragement and gave them the answers they were hoping for.  I continued my walk through the district. 
How much longer had I walked? 
‘…I wonder if they’re there?’
I decided to visit the Tower of Magic, since I had already received several letters at the tribal village. After this expedition, the royal family granted me a long, special vacation.  The letters requested my presence, explaining that I was continuing my personal research in the Tower’s laboratory, and that I should visit soon. 
‘Impregnable, my ass.’
As I arrived at the Tower, I couldn’t help but chuckle. 
For centuries, it had never been conquered by invaders. But that record had been broken twice in the past few years. 
Once by me.
And now by Noirarc. 
‘It’s not really impregnable, it just had good politics.’
Still, despite the ruined exterior, I’d heard that the interior damage wasn’t too severe. When the invasion began, they bought time with the barrier, packed up their research materials and equipment, and teleported out of the district with high-ranking officials and local dignitaries. 
‘I heard everything except the teleporting array was fine.’
They seemed to have taken everything, and the Noirarc folks knew about it.  I heard that the royal family only destroyed the array so they couldn’t use it, and they didn’t touch anything else. 
‘…I think the teleporting array was the only thing that got trashed.’
“Why are you standing out here?  You should have just gone inside and waited.”
Raven emerged from the lab behind me. 
“Hey, show some respect for the baron! Even though you’re so tiny.”
“…What?”
“Hey, what kind of talk is that? You’re so short.”
“Why are you picking a fight with me as soon as you see me? Did something annoy you on your way here?”
“······.”
“What, did something really happen?”
“No.”
It wasn’t exactly a lie. 
It wasn’t so much annoyance as it was the mental and physical fatigue from dealing with all the residents who were so interested in me. 
*** 
“Come in. We can talk inside.”
“Where have you been? I thought you’d be here all day, given how busy you are.”
“I didn’t go too far. I just went to borrow something from someone I know.”
“What?”
“It’s a research tool. Do you want the details?”
“No, that’s okay.”
I entered the lab and found a seat, noticing that Raven’s workspace had also changed significantly. 
“It’s a mess, right?  The whole Tower is a disaster after what happened. My master managed to pack up all the important stuff and get it out before I got here, but there are a lot of things missing when I look around.”
“I see.”
“Well, I brought a lot of things back to my lab in Cernon, so there’s not much left here anyway. Want something to drink?  You’re the baron, after all.”
“Just water.”
I drank from Raven’s 1.8L flask and caught up on what had happened.  It had been quite a while since I’d come back from the 1st Floor, and a lot had happened. 
“How do you always end up with these things happening right when you get back, Yandel?”
I summarized my experiences in the city, and Raven listened with bright eyes, occasionally chuckling at the absurdity of it all. 
“It’s like you’re always in the middle of every single event and incident in this world.”
Sad as it was, I couldn’t argue with her.  She already knew most of what I’d been through. Even if I denied it, I didn’t think she’d believe me. 
‘Why does the whole world feel like it’s out to get me?’
Was it truly a curse attached to my name?
As I contemplated this, Raven spoke in a sincere voice. 
“It’s a shame what happened.”
“What do you mean?  You’re talking about how I gave all the essences I got during the 1st Floor expedition to ordinary adventurers, right?  If I’d just researched them myself, I could’ve monopolized the annual Academic Award for years.”
“Oh, that.”
“Don’t misunderstand, I’m not blaming you or anything.  I just really thought it was very ‘Yandel’ of you when I heard what you’d done.”
“…What? You think it’s like me?”
For a moment, I thought she’d figured out the whole situation from that bit of information, but it turned out she hadn’t. 
“You made that decision to save the city and the people.  You can’t exactly call it wise, but no matter what anyone says, I…”
Raven looked at me, blushing slightly, her eyes wide. 
“I… personally… think it’s cool.”
It was the first time I’d seen this kind of look in Raven’s eyes. 
Was it something like admiration? 
“Oh… uh… you think so?”
“Yes.”
“But… you know.”
“······?”
Raven’s serious expression prevented me from even thinking about making a joke. I corrected her, as usual. 
“You… don’t need to be so disappointed.”
“I know. It was for the greater good.  It’d be a bit pathetic of me to feel that way, wanting to use them for my own personal gain…  I mean, from Yandel’s perspective, it’d be a little…”
“No, no, not that… ”
How should I put it? 
Raven was waiting for me to continue, so I decided to confess like a man. 
“Actually…”
“Yes, actually?”
“I already took everything I thought was useful.”
“······What?”
She asked, her voice filled with disbelief, taking a long pause. 
“You took… them?  What do you mean?”
“Exactly what I said.  If I just started handing them out like candy, the royal family wouldn’t be able to properly track their inventory.”
It was a clever scheme, no matter how you looked at it. 
As I patted myself on the back, Raven spoke, her voice cracking, as if in denial. 
“······You took the royal family’s spoils?”
“So?”
“Are you out of your mind?”
I knew I could face this kind of criticism, but I still couldn’t help but tilt my head. 
“Why are you suddenly bringing this up? It’s not like this was the first time.”
We’d already done this on the 1st Floor. 
Yes, so…
“You even liked it back then! You even named it something cool, ‘The Crown of Woe.’”
“Th, th, that’s different! You’re telling me all this now after doing something like that? Why are you telling me everything so honestly?!”
Oh, you’re trying to back out now. 
I was a little hurt by her attitude, but thankfully, I was well-versed in dealing with mages. 
“Because I wouldn’t want to hide anything—.”
“That doesn’t work anymore!”
“…Really?”
She’s a fast learner, being such a bookworm. 
“Anyway, don’t get too mad.  We’re both screwed if they catch us, right? It doesn’t really matter if they catch us with this or the other thing.”
“No! It’s not like that! We just had to keep our mouths shut about the other one, but this is on a whole other level!”
Well… she’s not wrong. 
“But so.”
“······?”
“Are you going to research it?”
“Th, that…!”
Raven looked at me like a puppy in front of a treat, unsure what to do. Then, she bowed her head, her voice like a whisper. 
“······I suppose I have to.”
See, I knew it.
