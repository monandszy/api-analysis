## The Jester (4)
Whir-r-r-r-r-!
A chilling wind swept across the desolate plain, kicking up a thick cloud of dust, revealing a burning skeleton beyond. 
Whoosh-!
The Corpse Collector, reduced to a mere skeleton engulfed in black flames. Even in this state, his bony hand held tight to the Underworld's Staff. 
‘…Why does he look so pathetic?’
He lacked the imposing presence he had when he first showcased his invincible skill in the Goblin Forest. The reason was simple.
One minute of invincibility. 
A surge in his physical stats, fueled by the transformation of his spiritual and magical abilities. 
While the skill itself remained unchanged, it had even received the blessing of the Underworld, making it even more powerful than before. 
Yet, despite this, the fiend made a different choice.
Instead of exploiting the full minute to land a fatal blow on my vital point, as he had intended, he...
Thud-thud-thud-!
Turned his back to me without hesitation and fled as fast as he could. 
His fleeing form evoked memories of a common insect. 
Back when I lived in a semi-basement, the cockroaches would scatter like this when I turned on the kitchen light.
‘…He is quick.’
The combination of the Underworld's blessing and the ephemeral immortality granted him a significant stat boost, resulting in incredible speed. 
Therefore, I immediately gave chase.
Boom-! Boom-!
I pushed my long, thick legs to their limits, my body drenched in sweat, but the distance between us only widened. How could such puny bones run so fast?
‘But in the end, he'll still die.’
The widening gap didn't stir any impatience within me. 
It was an open plain with no place to hide. It didn't matter how far he escaped. I simply followed his trail.
And…
‘One minute.’
As the [Ephemeral Immortality] faded after one minute, flesh began to reappear on the previously skeletal body.
Thud-thud-thud-!
Now, stripped of his immortality, he was fleeing with nothing but his staff in hand.
‘…Still not catching up.’
Seeing him maintain his quick escape even after the effect wore off was a minor annoyance, but not a major concern.  The Underworld's portal wouldn't close for a long time.
‘Its maximum duration was 24 hours, wasn't it?’
Even if we count the time since we arrived here, it hasn't been more than 30 minutes. In simpler terms, I still have over 23 hours.
Boom-! Boom-!
With each steady stride, a wry grin spread across my face.
‘Let's see how long he can run.’
A Barbarian never gives up.
***
Have you ever played tag?
If you have, you'd know. 
Even though it's a mere game, the feeling of being chased by someone creates a thrilling sense of tension and adrenaline. 
And if that's how you feel about a game, what about real tag?
Avet Necrapeto never truly understood. 
He was always the ‘chaser’.
Thud-thud-thud-!
My legs ached from the relentless movement. Perhaps due to the psychological pressure, my body felt more fatigued than usual.
“Huff… Huff…!”
My breath was shallow and labored, a testament to my exhaustion.
‘…Please… just give up!’
Despite the distance between us, he couldn't relax. 
The rhythmic footsteps from afar told him everything. 
The unwavering determination to never give up.
‘I need to increase the distance to completely escape…’
The desperate man used every trick at his disposal. 
He continuously pulled corpses from his subspace, strategically placing them to obstruct the Barbarian's path.
[R-r-r-r-r-!]
He erected walls from giant corpses.
[K-k-k-k-k-!]
He swung their rotting claws to irritate the Barbarian.
“Oh, stack overflow, nice.”
Completely oblivious to the Barbarian's contented grin behind him.
Thud-thud-thud-!
Time marched on.
One minute, two minutes, three minutes, four minutes…
Boom-! Boom-!
Ten minutes, twenty minutes, thirty minutes, forty minutes…
‘One hour…?’
He couldn't tell the exact time, but it felt like an hour had passed. 
The situation remained unchanged. He was riding the fastest of his summons, while the Barbarian continued his relentless march through the corpse legion. 
And the distance?
‘…Why won't it widen!’
It was about the same.
Two major issues plagued him.
Firstly, even with his summoned corpse legion and obstructive tactics, he had failed to hinder the tank-like Barbarian.
‘Enlargement.’
The Barbarian's [Enlargement] showed no signs of weakening.
Normally, such transformative abilities drain MP with every second, making prolonged use impossible.
‘If, only if… I could increase the distance without it!’
When would that skill finally deactivate? He didn’t know, but he clung to the hope that it wouldn’t last much longer. 
He believed that soon, the limit would be reached, [Enlargement] would fade, and he could finally escape.
A foolish hope, born from ignorance.
Avet Necrapeto was unaware.
“Björn Yandell has activated a transformative ability.”
“[Primordial Cells] effect activated. Soul Energy consumption reduced by half, maximum stat boosted by 1.5 times.” 
The Shield Barbarian was already at 70% completion.
“Björn Yandell has activated [Soul Dive].”
“Soul Energy is restored proportionally to the Soul Energy consumed.” 
Unless someone drained his MP from another source, his [Enlargement] would never deactivate.
Whoooooosh-!
A chilling sensation on his back forced Necrapeto to turn around, and he saw…
“The character has activated [Aegis' Dragon Armor].”
A colossal Soul Warrior, so massive that it dwarfed all sense of perspective.
‘…What kind of skill…  has already cooled down so fast!’
It wasn’t a skill but an item effect, but Avet Necrapeto had never heard of it. 
[Aegis' Dragon Armor] was a ‘Secret Number’ that didn’t even exist in the game. 
He had no way of knowing that the Barbarian's stack was rapidly accumulating because of the corpse legion he had summoned.
‘…Because of that… I tried everything to escape!’
He felt wronged. 
How could a tank use such absurd skills in succession?
Of course, he had no time for such complaints.
Thud-!
He jumped from his mount, narrowly dodging the colossal axe descending from the sky like a heavenly judgment.
The axe swing was dodged, but the summon beneath him was obliterated.
It would be restored thanks to the Underworld's field effect, but it would take at least a few hours for it to be fully restored.
“Well, I thought I could blow it up this time.”
The Barbarian's mumble could be heard from afar, thanks to his sharp hearing.
Necrapeto quickly got up and started running on his own two feet.
Thud-thud-thud-!
It took about five minutes of running on his own feet before he noticed something wrong. 
“…Ugh!”
He dodged the direct hit of the axe, but perhaps he hadn't completely avoided it.
‘My… My leg…’
One leg was fine, but the left one wasn't moving properly. 
He forced it to move, but with each movement, a throbbing pain slowly spread.
Crack-!
The pain grew worse, and it was only natural for his speed to decrease.
Necrapeto didn't dare look back. 
He focused solely on running, ignoring the throbbing pain. Yet, the sound behind him grew closer.
Boom! Boom!
One step, two steps.
He was running for his life, but the sound continued to draw closer.
Boom-!
Finally, the sound was right behind him.
“Ugh!”
He felt his hair being pulled, and his body was lifted off the ground.
“Finally caught you.”
He saw the Barbarian.
Mockingly, he…
“Hee-hee.”
… Laughed.
***
The chase was finally over.
It took a little over an hour…
‘Once everything is settled, I need to get some mobility skills fast.’
The chase was successfully concluded, but I immediately focused on identifying my shortcomings and ways to improve. 
After all, I've recently encountered too many situations where a lack of mobility skills has hindered me. 
This situation was no different. 
If only I had [Leap], I could have easily ended this chase much faster.
“Ha... ha... ha….”
Just then, the fiend let out a strained laugh.
“I, I was wondering if, if we could negotiate?”
These bastards, why do they always resort to this when cornered?
“Nope, not happening.”
“But, if we talk, maybe we could find a win-win situation.”
“Nope, there isn't one.”
“...”
“So, let's die now.”
I clenched my fist, ready to put this little bug to sleep.
But then…
“...Huh?”
“I, I don't want to die like this!…!!”
The fiend, held by his hair, pulled out a dagger from his subspace and swung it.
Whoosh-!
Needless to say, his dagger wasn't aiming for my body.
He didn't try to cut my skin, which would barely scratch me, but instead cut his own hair.
And then…
Thud.
He rolled on the ground, performing a perfect escape maneuver and creating distance between us.
‘This bastard… he still finds escape routes in a situation like this.’
The way he abandoned Vivienne last time, he really has a strong desire to live. 
Not that I blame him.
“If you wanted to live so badly, you shouldn't have done things that deserved death.”
With that, I brought my hammer down.
But…
Whoooooosh-!
The fiend dodged, rolling away with surprising agility.
However, I had anticipated his escape, so I immediately launched a kick towards his head.
But what was this?
Thud.
He dodged the kick with a backflip, his injured leg seemingly causing no hindrance. 
He’s surprisingly agile.
‘One clean hit is all I need…’
The fiend, understanding the situation, fought back desperately.
Whoooooosh-!
He swung his hammer.
Whoooooosh-!
He extended his hand.
Whoooooosh-!
He brought his hammer down again, but none of his attacks landed.
‘Ugh, this bastard is so hard to hit.’
It felt like trying to catch a fly. 
He wasn't really a threat, but like a fly, he was impossible to grasp with bare hands.
I just needed one finishing blow, but every one I landed missed.
“Can't you just die already?”
I was getting slightly irritated, but in such moments, I need to stay calm. 
“...Huff... Huff…”
Even a pebble rolling on the ground can teach us something.
Once I let go of my frustration, I saw the fiend dodging my attacks with almost an otherworldly focus. 
This gave me a new realization.
Whoooooosh-!
The reason my attacks weren't landing was because of my mindset.
While the fiend was using every ounce of his senses to dodge each blow, what about me?
Was I truly giving it my all, using every tactic at my disposal?
The answer was ‘No’.
So, that means…
‘Aha, a mental attack is the answer.’
I continued my empty hammer swings while speaking. The words that, in my judgement, would best disrupt his focus at this moment.
“Do you know, Avet Necrapeto?”
“...”
“I’m actually a Demon.”
“...?”
The fiend’s pupils trembled slightly, but he still dodged my hammer by arching his back.
Hmm, that’s not enough.
“I was born and raised in Korea.”
I spoke rapidly, leaving him no time to think.
“I used the nickname ‘Elfnuna’ in Stone Aiben.”
“...What?”
Ah, finally a real reaction.
Elfnuna is a pretty well-known name, after all.
And I said it properly in English, too.
Whoooooosh-!
“Ugh!”
His focus faltered, and the hammer grazed his nose.
He’s dodging even this?
“The Jester, Avet Necrapeto.”
When I uttered the name I used only at the Round Table, his pupils dilated.
His eyes seemed to scream:
‘…How do you know that name!’
Well, how do I know?
Hee-hee.
A sense of liberation washed over me as I said:
“I am…,”
The truth I had always wanted to tell him.
“... The Masked Hunter.”
“………!!!!!!”
Ah, that feels good.
Seeing his disbelief, my stress melted away.
“…Y, you are?”
The fiend stopped moving and looked at me.
“The Hunt… er?”
I nodded in response.
Yes, I am the Masked Hunter.
So…
“The character has activated [Swing].”
Time to die.
Crack-!!!
Just like a bug.
