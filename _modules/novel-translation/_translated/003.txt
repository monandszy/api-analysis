The Barbarian, meaning "savage" in direct translation, was the first race I chose when I started playing. I picked the Greatsword. Of course, it was because it looked cool. Any man would want to wield a sword in both hands, spinning wildly in the heart of the enemy's ranks.
"The problem was, it died too easily."
Intrigued by the Barbarian character, I began to research. How could I raise a Barbarian to have high survivability? I tried various methods, but the Barbarian still died too easily. No matter how much I boosted its survivability, it remained nothing more than a berserker. 
Each battle was a tightrope walk, and its lack of stability was a constant concern.  At some point, doubt crept in. "Do I have to use this guy as a damage dealer?"
Barbarians have the highest HP among all the playable races, with a high Strength stat, allowing them to wear Adamantium armor. Although not as powerful as the overpowered Dwarves with their special abilities, they still possess the fundamental qualities of a tank. 
Well, despite that, I didn't really want to play a tank Barbarian. However, I decided to give it a try because I felt it would be a waste to throw away all the research I had done. After a few trial-and-error attempts to find a suitable build, I thought, "What the hell, this character is a cheat."
Without a moment's hesitation, I abandoned the Dwarf, who was my original tank. What if I couldn't engage in thrilling battles? I always prioritized efficiency, and as a gamer, I could discard my preferences for a more effective approach. 
Like the decision I made just now.
I returned to my place after choosing my weapon, and I could feel the other Barbarians staring at me. What are you looking at? Never seen a Shield Barbarian before? 
Maintaining a confident, Barbarian-like demeanor, I walked to my spot and stood there. This time, I didn't have to act.
"Next!"
I had no regrets about my decision. There were three reasons. First, the shield is the most expensive item to sell among the starting weapons. Second, there's a high chance I won't be able to use any weapon properly, at least not right away. Third, my ultimate goal is to become a Shield Barbarian.
Today, I made the most rational decision I could.
"You are now a warrior!"
After choosing my weapon and returning to my place, I finally had some time to myself. While the other Barbarians were going through their initiation, I decided to speculate about the root cause of this whole situation. It was something I should have considered earlier, but...
What could I do?
If I had spent my time pondering that, I would have already been dead.
"You have reached the Abyss."
Let's at least summarize it now. I reached the final boss room. This was likely the trigger.
"Wait, then what about the guy who died before? Did he also reach the final boss room?"
...Maybe. There are many people in the world, and some of them are as strange as me. Let's just move on from this.
"Tutorial Complete."
I interpreted this message as follows. You've been given all the knowledge you need, so use it to survive. Whoever wrote it, they must be a cruel bastard. If they really wanted me to survive, they should have given me some backstory about the "demon" or whatever it is. I almost died right after I arrived! You son of a bitch!
"Whew..."
Was it because I was inside a Barbarian's body? My emotional control was slipping. For this reason, I decided to stop overthinking. There's no point getting worked up about it, and besides, dwelling on the cause and getting stressed isn't my style. It already happened, and it's irreversible. It's more productive to think about how to move forward.
So...
Right, let's focus on that for now.
"Surviving."
The initiation was over. Now, I'm walking along a forest path. The tribal leader is in front of me, and behind me are young Barbarians. They all seem happy, like they're going on a picnic. But I can't smile genuinely like them. I know their final destination.
"Halt!"
We arrived at a 30-meter high wall after passing through dense bushes. 
"Open the gate!"
The gate creaked open with a clunky mechanical sound. It was so slow, it made me yawn. But the young Barbarians watched with bated breath, as if they had forgotten how to breathe. Finally, a gray city emerged from behind the gate, breaking the strange silence.
"Rapdonia..."
Perhaps in this moment, my gaze is no different from theirs.
Paved roads and stone structures. In between them, a towering spire reaching for the sky. I never dreamed that I would see what I had only seen in the loading screen illustration.
Damn it.
"Warriors!"
The tribal leader turned and shouted as the gate opened. I wondered if he was going to say something encouraging before letting them go, but...
"Go! Your destiny awaits you there!"
There was no need for a boring speech for Barbarians.
"Woooooo!"
The newly-initiated Barbarians roared and rushed into the city. I didn't really want to, but I followed them, shouting too. There are probably people sleeping soundly in those dark buildings, but who cares?
I'm a Barbarian.
"Woong!"
I could hear the gate closing behind me. Of course, none of the Barbarians paid any attention.
The excited Barbarians ran for a while before finally calming down and slowing down. It was then that I could calmly continue my thoughts.
I am currently experiencing conflicting emotions.
"..."
Fear of the situation I am facing.
And a certain sense of anticipation that I have become part of the world I enjoyed playing the most.
It's kind of funny. I just decided to focus on surviving, and here I am, experiencing this kind of emotion.
...I guess I'm not normal.
Not compared to these Barbarian bastards.
"Halt!"
The Barbarian leader at the front stopped walking and turned around to shout confidently.
"We seem to have lost our way!"
The Barbarians murmured in response to this shocking confession.
"The third son of Fanoun, Karak, led us astray!"
"He is unfit to lead!"
"He must be held accountable!"
Get lost. They were all happy to follow him.
Is this how Barbarian society works? It's ruthless.
"Fine. Stop. I admit I am unfit and will step down from my position as leader."
Karak, the second and third son of Fanoun, bowed his head and returned to the group in response to the continued criticism.
The next leader chosen was a female Barbarian.
"The second daughter of Pnellin, Ainarr!"
"The wise Ainarr will lead us to the right path!"
Emboldened by the words of encouragement, the female Barbarian happily took the lead.
However, it didn't take long for her to follow the same path as her predecessor.
"...We seem to have lost our way."
Surprisingly, they even used the same words, down to the last syllable.
"How could this be? We must reach the Labyrinth within the allotted time!"
"Ainarr is unfit to lead!"
"You're right!"
Confused, the Barbarians began seriously discussing who to choose as their third leader.
"The second son of Tetran, Jin, seems like a good choice."
"No. I don't think so. Rather..."
Do these bastards have brains?
No matter who leads, they can't reach their destination. Don't they realize that?
Maybe it'll be my turn soon.
"..."
I quietly stepped back and approached the second leader. 
She was a little short of 2 meters tall and had a dejected expression, slightly separated from the group.
"The son of Yandell, Bjorn? Have you come to blame me too?"
No way.
In my eyes, they are all the same.
I shook my head, and the female Barbarian tilted her head in confusion.
"Then why have you come? I don't need consolation."
"No. I've come to show you how to find our way."
"...Is that true? How?"
I pointed to a specific place with my hand.
"Just keep following them."
"Just follow them?"
She looked unconvinced.
I patiently explained the logical steps.
It's midnight in the city. All the buildings on the main street are dark. But it's not too late to be walking around because there are quite a few people on the streets. They're all armed, not wearing their usual clothes.
Where could they be going?
"You're right. Now that I think about it, that makes sense. Let's give it a try."
The female Barbarian returned to the group, shouting that she had found the way. The Barbarians cheered, abandoning the process of choosing a third leader.
"It's Ainarr!"
"A wise warrior woman!"
Anyway, the group started moving again.
As if they were on the right track, the number of armed people around us increased. Soon, we could see a light radiating in all directions from a distance.
If we've come this far, at least we won't get lost.
"The Labyrinth! I see the Labyrinth!"
"The sacred dimension of battle!"
I resumed my interrupted thoughts.
My biggest concern is whether entering the Labyrinth is the right decision.
"I feel it! The Labyrinth is calling my soul!"
The Barbarians, consumed by excitement, wouldn't notice if I slipped away from the group.
Then, I don't have to enter the Labyrinth.
I don't have to fight monsters and bleed.
But, knowing this, I still haven't been able to resolve my doubts.
'It's because I know running away isn't the answer, right?'
There's a tax system in "Dungeon & Stone." All citizens over 20 years old must pay taxes, and those who fail to do so will be executed. Just hearing this makes you wonder if it's a crappy game, but it makes sense when you consider the world.
This isn't something to worry about just yet, but...
"Ainarr! Let's pick up the pace!"
"Woooooo!"
Anyway, I need to make some money. 
Of course, I don't necessarily have to fight monsters in the Labyrinth. Even if I worked at a tavern, I could at least eat and sleep.
...If I weren't a Barbarian, that is.
Barbarians are the only race that gets weapons from the start of the game. 
There's a simple reason for this.
[Barbarian? Sorry, I just rescued someone.]
[Get lost! I don't have any work for you! What are you trying to break this time?!]
Barbarians can't do ordinary jobs. 
According to the in-game setting, the only way for them to make a living is to fight monsters in the Labyrinth. 
Well, it's still unknown what it's like in real life.
Maybe I could get a job more easily than I thought.
But it's risky to leave the group just because of that one thing.
"The Labyrinth will close in 10 minutes. Enter quickly!"
The Labyrinth opens once a month in game time.
In other words, if I don't enter this time, I have to survive in this city for a month.
What if I can't find a job?
What if no one hires me because I'm a Barbarian?
Well, my future looks bleak.
I could survive for a week on the food given to me by the tribal leader, but after that, I would have to scavenge for scraps.
Or maybe I'll starve to death before that.
One thing is for sure: even if I survive, my body will be completely different from what it is now.
"I'll be the first one to enter!"
"No! I will!"
Hunger, cold, unsanitary sleeping conditions.
I know better than anyone how these things can be fatal to the human body.
So, if I'm going to enter anyway, it's more rational to do it now when I'm in the best condition.
'The problem is, it could shorten my lifespan.'
I was deep in thought when...
"The son of Yandell, Bjorn!"
Someone grabbed my shoulder.
It was the female Barbarian from before.
Her name was definitely...
"The third daughter of Pnellin, Ainarr."
"It's the second daughter."
Anyway, what does she want from me?
It was strangely quiet.
I checked, and there were hardly any Barbarians left in the square, let alone anyone else.  Ainarr must have come to check on me because I was just standing there.
"We need to hurry. We're running out of time because we arrived late."
I looked at the front.
The portal, which had radiated a brilliant light from a distance before, was now noticeably smaller.
"Five minutes to closing!"
Just in time, the guide announced the remaining time.
Five minutes? That's tighter than I thought.
I need to make a decision soon...
"Go first. I'll follow right behind you."
"Okay."
Ainarr nodded and headed towards the portal, deepening my anxieties. 
Now, what should I do?
I was a hardcore efficiency freak who always preferred to rush things, but this time, it was hard to make a decision. It's not a game; my actual life is on the line.
"The son of Yandell, Bjorn!"
I almost stumbled backward without thinking.
Suddenly, Ainarr, who was walking fine, turned around.
"Thanks for earlier."
"...You don't have to thank me."
"And I have a question."
Anything except my mother's name.
I nodded, and Ainarr asked with 100% sincerity.
"How can I be as wise as you? I've never met a Barbarian as intelligent as you. I want to be like you."
It's a difficult question to answer. How can you be intelligent? Honestly, it would be faster to just be born again, but...
No, why am I even thinking about this?
Let's just give a vague answer and send her off.
"Always think before you act."
"Hmm, I see!"
It was a thoughtless answer, but Ainarr pondered my words with a serious expression.
Then, she said something unexpected.
"Thank you for the advice. If I make it out of the Labyrinth alive, I'll make sure to repay you."
"Make it out alive?"
It sounds too strange coming from a Barbarian.
So, I asked a pointless question out of character.
"...Are you afraid of dying?"
"Of course I am. Everyone is afraid of dying. Probably the other warriors too, but they just don't show it."
Is that right?
Honestly, it doesn't resonate with me.
Barbarians in the game were fearless.
They seemed the same in real life too.
Ainarr elaborated when I didn't respond.
"We were born warriors. If we can't fight, we die."
Her tone was clumsy and stiff, but I somehow understood what she was trying to say.
"I see."
Just like me, they had no choice.
They were born Barbarians.
If they didn't slay monsters in the Labyrinth, they couldn't survive in this city.
That's why they learned to overcome their fears from a young age.
That's all it was.
That's why they seemed like savages.
"Let's see who survives. The son of Yandell, Bjorn."
Soon, Ainarr entered the portal.
"One minute to closing!"
There's nothing holding me back now.
Only my choice remains.
As in the phrase that came to mind when I entered the final boss room, there are two options.
[Yes / No]
My mind, which had been filled with confusion, feels clear.
That's right, let's just think of it as a game.
When I played games, I always prioritized efficiency to achieve my goals. I considered the possibilities before taking action, and always moved with the next step in mind. If the immediate gain resulted in a loss in the long run, I chose "No." If the opposite was true, I chose "Yes."
That's why I never had a choice.
"The Gate is closing soon! Retreat!"
I ran forward.
Like when the tribal leader called my name, deep down, fear welled up inside me. It's understandable because I've been frail my whole life, and I don't even have any experience with a fistfight.
What if the opponent is a monster?
I'm already getting scared.
"Dangerous!"
But, if there's absolutely no chance...
I have the unbelievably strong Barbarian body right now.
The knowledge I gained from leveling up countless times.
Most importantly, I have the grand goal of survival.
So, I have no choice.
Even though I know, better than anyone, that I'm making a choice that will lead to a terrible ordeal that a sane person wouldn't make.
Because I think it's the most rational choice—
"Entered the 1st Floor Crystal Cave."
That's why I thought that way.
