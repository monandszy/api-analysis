## The Prison (4)
There's a saying in this world: that after being prisoners for a long time, inmates start boasting about their shackles. 
Whose are bigger, heavier, sturdier? 
How much they suffer wearing them. 
At first glance, it seems ridiculous to think they'd brag about such things. 
But in truth, that saying might be true. 
After all, I'm not much different.
Good equipment.
Status. 
Money.
Skills and experience, and so on…
A sense of pride washes over me for the fruits of my hard work and sweat, coupled with a desire for others to acknowledge it. Yet, sometimes an emptiness sweeps over me.
What's the point of all this wealth, fame, and power?
The moment I return to the original world, it all becomes a meaningless waste of effort.
So, I thought.
Good equipment.
Status.
Money.
Skills and experience, and so on…
No matter how much I brag about it, to some, it will only be a boast about my shackles.
“Ugh, I want a Big Mac.” 
This world is a prison, after all.
***
There's a man staring intently into a mirror.
Thump-thump
A face that could be considered fairly handsome.
Clad in full white armor.
Thump-thump
He stares at his reflection for a long while, feeling a strange awkwardness. 
No, it's not just "a strange" awkwardness, is it?
Swish.
He traces a finger along the upper left portion of his breastplate.
The area touched is empty, only a faint mark visible with a closer look.
You know, like how a sticker leaves a residue after you peel it off.
Thump.
He pulls his hand away from the mark.
He is no longer a knight of the Order.
Officially leaving the Order, he became an outsider, forbidden from using the title of 'Knight' any longer.
As proof, he returned the insignia that had adorned his armor.
No more dawn prayers, no more pre-meal prayers, no more mandatory attendance at midnight prayers, where everyone gathered.
But…
Thump-thump
Despite this, the man in the mirror kneels on the carpeted floor, eyes closed, offering a perfunctory prayer.
A ritual he has carried on every morning since leaving the Order.
"The twilight stars shall guide us…"
He actually hated praying.
Even when he was in the Order, he would grumble inwardly about the constant prayers, and sometimes even skip them with excuses.
However, he still holds onto the morning prayer for one simple reason.
It’s the same reason all humans pray to a deity, in a way.
“Your servant humbly implores you. Please do not take your power from me. Grant me your mercy. Deliver me from this crisis.”
It's because he is anxious.
He cultivated a tank character using divine power as his primary skill. 
Losing that power overnight would turn him into a useless piece of trash.
In fact, there are many cases of people losing their divine power after leaving the Order.
Well, to be honest, prayer does calm me down.
Even a mere stone desires to rely on something.
Thump-thump
The man rises from his kneeling position. 
Gazing at the ceiling, he says,
“…Please, I’m begging you. It seems like the Goddess cares for the Baron, so please let me continue to serve him at his side. Okay?”
It was a rather flippant tone for a prayer, but it wasn't unusual for him.
Even during his time with the Order, his outward prayers were devout while his inner voice used this same tone.
Yet, his divine power continued to grow.
Perhaps the Goddess prefers this easygoing camaraderie.
…Or maybe not.
Knock-knock.
Just as he was about to leave, a knock echoed from the door.
"Parav, are you in there?"
The woman waiting by the door had a familiar face.
Petite build.
Round eyes.
Her overall impression was gentle, yet her expression hinted at stubbornness and righteousness. 
"Marone? What is it? The assembly time is still some time away…"
"Just… I've heard that wearing full armor is inconvenient, so I came to see if there was anything I could help with. But it looks like you managed to get it on all by yourself already!"
"Haha… It was difficult at first, but I finally got the hang of it. Thank you for your concern."
"If you're done, shall we go together? The assembly time is almost here."
"Ah, yes, that would be good."
Thus, the two left the lodging and headed towards the assembly point. 
Several others were already gathered there, including the Deputy Commander with a serious expression. 
Bersil Goulând.
Another prisoner in this vast prison, with shackles as impressive as my own.
For her, a new set of shackles had recently been added.
“I didn't realize it at first, but I feel Yandell's absence so much these days. Goulând, you must be struggling too…"
“Haha… Yes, I suppose…”
Parav awkwardly chuckled, taking a deep breath.
Thump-!
His heart was pounding without any strenuous exercise, from the moment he woke up.
A symptom that started the day he returned to this city.
It had been days, so he should be used to it by now, but…
This damn thing just won't calm down.
Thump, thump, thump, thump, thump-!
He felt anxious, and sometimes even panicky, so much that breathing became difficult.
It was all because of that gut feeling—a blessing or a curse, he wasn't sure.
‘Please, let me get through today without any problems.’
He closed his eyes and offered another prayer to the Goddess of this world, his symptoms suddenly worsening.
And then,
Fssshhhoooommm-!
A sound like a fighter jet taking off assaulted his eardrums.
All the members of the clan in the open space looked up at the sky, where the sound came from.
And they were all speechless.
“What?”
Something shot up into the sky like a rocket, drawing an arc and heading towards the heart of the city.
From high above, it moved slowly, yet extremely fast.
A brilliant something was launched, leaving a clear trace in the sky.
And…
Baang! Baang! Baang! Baang-!
The bells installed on the city walls rang out in unison.
KWA-AAAA-AAAAAA-AA-NG-!!!
Soon, the entire city started shaking.
***
Drdrdrdrd-!
A faint vibration reached the sixth floor underground.
I gazed at Raven, my thoughts sorting themselves.
"A portal, you say…."
A Barbarian, when presented with an absurd claim, doesn’t immediately dismiss it as impossible. 
Although, the mage herself seemed a bit unsure.
“It… might not be… a portal. I just felt a faint, magical wave from beyond, a wave characteristic of a portal…."
A mage is more sensitive to magic than anyone else, even if she’s not a "Guide" who can sense a portal’s presence from afar.
Therefore, there must truly be a portal beyond.
Besides… I vaguely remember hearing about this before.
Thump, thump…
The Round Table twenty years ago.
No, it’s been much longer than that now, so I should say “twenty-some years” ago.
But regardless, the otherworldly Evil Spirit, “Kagureas”, said, 
[There’s a portal in the palace basement.]
Besides the dimensional plaza, there’s a portal somewhere in the palace basement.
Maybe that's this place.
"Don't tell me this is a portal connected to the Labyrinth…?"
Well, I'll have to confirm it, but it's likely not connected to the Labyrinth.
“Kagureas” also mentioned this:
[I found out about it by chance, but it doesn’t seem like a portal connected to the Labyrinth.]
That’s also a "hear-say" kind of thing.
But it was said by the person who first discovered it, so it must have some credibility.
“Anything else besides the portal?”
“I’d need to examine it more closely…”
“Get on with it. We might’ve just made a huge discovery.”
Did she like the phrase "huge discovery"?
Raven wasn't simply following my request but was eagerly inspecting the box(?) where the portal was supposed to be.
She walked around it in a circle.
She circled it again, carefully examining it for any holes or recesses.  She floated up using Levitation magic, curious about the top. 
KWA-AANG-!
She smashed the wall with her mace, and even gave me instructions, like "If you find a shovel, dig down there," and so on...
After trying everything she could, she could only confirm one thing.
There was nothing else to find, other than the presence of the portal.
Oh, one more thing?
It wasn't something discovered during the investigation, though.
“Hey, Yandell! Look! The ceiling where we fell has been repaired!”
The part of the floor on the fifth floor that had caused us to fall had been neatly restored.
Apparently, it completely eliminated the faint vibrations we had been feeling.
This made me feel as if we were trapped in a completely isolated space, and my anxiety spiked.
“Teleportation? Teleportation is still possible, right?”
“What? Oh… wait!”
Raven finally seemed to realize that we might be trapped here forever.  She quickly drew a magic circle on the ground and started experimenting.
And…
“Yandell…?”
“Spit it out.”
“There… is good news and bad news…”
“Bad news first.”
“It looks like we can’t use the multi-teleportation magic here. The magic keeps dispersing…”
Damn it, are we actually trapped?
I couldn’t believe it, but I tried to keep my voice calm. 
"Then what's the good news?"
“It’s not visible to the naked eye, but there is a spatial displacement magic circle embedded in the floor here.  It’s probably why the magic keeps dispersing, but if we activate it…”
“Just the gist.”
“We can escape, but we don’t know where we'll end up.”
…So, I don't have to worry about being trapped here forever.
That’s a relief.
“You know about military magic circles, right? It’s almost the same way. You place a magic circle at a designated location and consume magic to easily travel back and forth…”
“Just the key points.”
“This particular magic circle has only one circuit. It can only travel back and forth in two directions. So, what are we going to do?”
There was no need to even contemplate.
“Are you sure there’s nothing else to find here?”
“Yes. Unless there's research equipment here, this is the limit of what we can do with bare hands.”
“Understood. Activate the magic circle.”
“Okay.”
As if she already knew I was going to choose this option, Raven started the activation process without a word.
“It will probably take some time. I'm going to check if there’s anything dangerous here. I’ll let you know when I’m done, so take a rest.”
Hearing that it would take a while, I walked towards the cubic structure in the center.
It wasn't black or white but a grayish color.
Its surface was soft enough to leave a mark if you touched it, but its durability was strong enough to withstand dozens of mace blows without a single scratch.
‘If there really is a portal inside, there must be a way to enter…’
Maybe there’s a magic key or card reader that opens a door when you use it?
But if it was magic, Raven would have noticed something…
As I continued to ponder this, I thought about another issue, too impatient to waste time on this.
‘Noark.’
This might be a more pressing matter than the mysterious box.
Who are they allied with and what are they trying to achieve?
It seems a bit dubious to simply assume they're trying to overthrow the royal family.
‘…District Seven.’
Is District Seven okay?
It looks like there was another "thunderclap" right before the collapse…
I hope they’re safe…
“Huh?”
As my thoughts drifted that far, I flinched and stepped back from the box(?).
I couldn’t help it.
A mark resembling a human handprint appeared from the bottom of the wall I was just touching.
Swish.
I slowly extended my hand towards the handprint. 
The imprint, as if pressed from the other side, writhed.
I could also faintly hear a voice.
[Let me out.]
The unexpected situation sent shivers down my spine, but at least I now understood what this box was.
[Please.]
This box was a prison.
