## Black Star (4)
Kang Hyun-byeol.
My ex-girlfriend, four years younger than me. We dated for about three years, starting with her confession while we were both preparing for jobs. But that’s not important now.
I shifted my gaze upward and met Hyun-byeol’s eyes. For some reason, her stare was cold. Perhaps it was because…
“How can you look at that in this situation?”
“Ahem… ”
What was I supposed to do? It wasn’t like I could stop my eyes from looking. 
I quickly regained my composure and responded.
“Don’t misunderstand. I was just checking.”
“Checking?”
“The base outfit here is supposed to reflect your self-image.”
“So… this is how I see myself?”
“That’s right.”
If you want a different outfit, you need to purchase it using GP. The tracksuit and the T-shirt I’m wearing now were bought that way.
I was about to mention that base outfits could be a little uncomfortable when…
“What about you, oppa?”
“…?”
“What was your base outfit, oppa?”
“Uh…”
It was a navy blue suit that fit me perfectly. Hyun-byeol had bought it for me as a celebration for getting a job. But…
“This. This is my base outfit.”
Saying that felt a little embarrassing. It would make it seem like I still had feelings for her, and we’ve been broken up for a long time now.
“…Hmm, that’s so oppa.”
Thankfully, Hyun-byeol didn’t seem to suspect anything and readily agreed.  However, it sparked a new curiosity.
“So, you think that’s me? What’s so ‘oppa’ about it?”
“Why are you asking such a sensitive question? I just meant it looked comfortable.”
“Oh… really?”
Ugh, I can’t even breathe freely around her.  Is it because I’ve done so many things wrong?
“Anyway… don’t you have anything to say to me?”
“…Long time no see, Hyun-byeol!”
“That’s it?”
“Uh…”
What else could I say? Oh, I forgot to ask something important.
“So, how did you end up here?”
Hyun-byeol stared at me silently before letting out a sigh, like she’d given up.
“You still haven’t gotten rid of your habit of running away.”
I just pretended I didn’t hear her.
“Fine. It’s not like it matters anymore now…”
“Right. What’s the past? The present is more valuable than gold, they say…”
A chill ran down my spine.
“Why did you stop?  Continue.”
“Just… I think I need to apologize first.”
“…”
“I’m sorry about what happened back then. It’s sincere.”
I apologized, removing any traces of playfulness from my voice. Hyun-byeol looked at me with slightly surprised eyes.
“You’ve… changed a lot, oppa.”
“I guess it’s inevitable… But so, are you going to accept my apology?”
“If it’s an apology, that’s fine. Like I said, what’s the point now? It’s not like it was anyone’s fault…”
“That’s… true.”
After exchanging a few words, an awkward silence fell between us. 
Of course, it was understandable. 
This was like a reunion with an ex-girlfriend I broke up with a year ago in real time, in a far-off world.
“Anyway, I’m really surprised. I never imagined I’d see you here.”
“Really?  I thought we’d meet someday.”
“…Huh?”
“After I woke up here, I kept thinking that you’d be somewhere in this world too. I felt a bit reassured.”
“Reassured…?”
“About your disappearance. I was so shocked when I heard about it. I wondered if you had some bad thoughts…”
Oh, that’s how it could’ve looked.
It’s been over a year since we broke up, and she still worried about me. I felt a bit grateful.
“So, how did you end up here?”
This was the third time I asked the same question, as our conversation kept getting sidetracked.
“You’re so far from gaming… I mean, it’s pretty obvious…”
Thankfully, this time Hyun-byeol answered properly.
“Well… after I broke up with you, I got a little interested. I wanted to know why you were so into it, what made it so fun.”
It felt surreal.
When we were dating, she would scold me for playing these games, even using three computers at once.
Wait a minute.
“So… did you beat the original version?”
“No way.  I played the cheat version later. I found it by chance after you disappeared.”
“So… how many times did you play on high multiplier?”
“30 times.”
“30 times…?”
30 times is a pretty high multiplier.
Even those who couldn’t beat the original game and chose high multiplier mode still struggled in this world.
“…You must’ve played really hard…”
“Nah, it was easy after playing the original. It was simple compared to that one. I learned a lot from watching you play back then, too.”
“Ah…”
Come to think of it, I often explained and bragged to Hyun-byeol about things like hidden items. She was a smart girl, so she must’ve remembered everything.
“Why is your expression suddenly dark?”
“…You can see that?”
“Of course. We spent a lot of time together.”
I thought for a moment before answering honestly.
“It’s nothing. Just, thinking back now, it seems like you listened to me talk about things you weren’t interested in, without complaining.”
I trailed off, feeling awkward.
Hyun-byeol’s answer came after a brief pause.
“…Oppa, you’ve really changed a lot.”
“Time passes quickly.”
“That’s… yes, it does…”
Another awkward silence was about to settle in, but it was short-lived. When I asked if she knew what happened after I disappeared, she told me everything she knew.
Here’s a brief summary.
They filed a missing person report a month later. The police came looking for you, and that’s how she learned about it.
And…
“You met my mom…?”
“Yes. At the police station.”
“What did that woman say…?”
“She didn’t talk to me directly.”
“But something happened.”
“…”
“Tell me. It’s okay.”
Hyun-byeol seemed to hesitate before carefully speaking.
“She talked a lot about the inheritance… and asked the police if there was no way to file a death report before the missing person period expired.”
“Ha…”
I expected it, but it’s still disgusting.
How much money did I save up?
I was a fool to even have a shred of hope.
Click.
I clenched my jaw unconsciously. Hyun-byeol offered words of comfort.
“W-well, you still have five years. It wasn’t an accident, and there’s no evidence that you were a victim of crime, so it wasn’t classified as a special missing person case.”
“What’s different about that?”
“Special missing person cases allow for inheritance after only one year.”
“I see.”
That’s a little comforting.
Even thinking about it, it felt a little funny. 
Was that Hyun-byeol’s style of comfort?
Come to think of it, she always focused on the positive aspects and offered logical comfort rather than just empty sympathy.
She played a significant role in shaping my current personality.
“So what happened next?”
“I don’t know. Three months after you disappeared, I got dragged here too.”
“What…?”
I was genuinely surprised.
The fragment stone warped time, but in terms of simple time, it’s been three years and nine months since I became Bjorn Yandell.
And since the time ratio was 5:1…
‘Nine months have passed in the real world since I disappeared.’
In other words, Hyun-byeol survived over two and a half years in this world.
Thinking about it, I became curious.
“But why did you come to the community now?”
“I’m not an explorer. I guess they didn’t notice me because of that.”
“You’re not an explorer…?”
“No. Does it even make sense that someone who played a game for a while would fight monsters in the real world? I just got a decent job and earned money.”
“It sounds like you’re human.”
“Guess you’re not?”
Hyun-byeol’s question left me speechless.
I was struggling with whether to reveal this kind of personal information.
But did she sense my hesitation in that short moment?
“Right, you don’t want to tell me.”
Hyun-byeol’s eyes curved into a long smile.
***
It was the same look I saw many times when we were dating. Back then, I would squirm and try to make things better, but I didn’t need to do that now.
To be frank, we’re strangers now, aren’t we?
Hyun-byeol was always rational, so she wouldn’t fail to realize this.
“So, oppa, you drew the line first?”
“Yes.”
“…Fine. I won’t ask you about that anymore. Okay?”
She agreed coolly, as expected from Hyun-byeol.
But did she feel a little hurt, even though she acted tough?
“But oppa, don’t expect me to tell you about my life. I won’t tell you even if you die.”
Well, that’s fair enough. 
There was no room for rebuttal, so I nodded my head without any regret. 
Hyun-byeol bit her lip.
“You’re really not curious at all.”
“If I hear about your life, I have to tell you about mine too.”
I answered honestly instead of dodging the question.
She knows exactly when I entered this world, right? If she just tells me her species, the candidates for her origin would be significantly reduced.
“…”
“…”
Silence stretched between us, as we simply stared at each other.
“…Let’s sit down for a moment.”
“…Yes, that’s a good idea.”
We decided to sit on the nearby sofa, as standing awkwardly felt a bit uncomfortable. 
But once we sat, there was no topic to talk about.
So I started with something light.
“This is your first time in the community, right?”
“Yes.”
I suddenly wondered how she would’ve gotten an invitation if she had lived a normal life in this world, but I suppressed my curiosity.
“Want some GP?  You can trade it for cash at the exchange, too.”
“No, thank you. I can make that much myself. Besides, if you convert GP to cash, there’s bound to be a physical exchange, right?  It could reveal your identity.”
“That’s… true.”
Actually, I just wanted to start a conversation. If she ever wanted to convert GP to cash, I would’ve stopped her.
“Oppa… you must’ve become an explorer, right?”
“Yes, I did.”
We agreed not to mention anything that could reveal each other’s identities, but I readily admitted it.
I couldn’t let her refuse even such a trivial topic.
“But why are you smiling?”
“It’s just… I can’t imagine you fighting with monsters and getting bloody.”
“It happens when you do it.”
“You must’ve struggled.”
“What about you?”
“I’m just doing okay. This world’s more comfortable than my real job, actually.”
Well, she’s the smartest person I’ve ever met.
She must’ve adapted to this world very quickly…
“Really. This place is so poorly digitized that making starting capital is easy.”
Was she implying she’s embezzling money now?
“The market itself is so vulnerable that I’m making a good return once I started to really invest.”
“…”
“Oppa.”
“…Yes?”
“In that sense, why don’t we stop playing this game and just… combine forces?”
“Ha, combine… we were already—”
“No, I don’t mean let’s start over. I mean let’s combine our strength. I’ll help you from behind the scenes.”
“Help?”
“My goal was to gain power after becoming financially free. And recently, I got close to someone pretty high up. I’ll use that power to support you.”
“What’s the cost?”
“Isn’t that obvious? In exchange, you bring me with you when we return. You must be aiming to go back, right?”
“Return… ”
I trailed off, and Hyun-byeol seemed to sense something and changed her expression.
“Oppa… are you planning to stay here forever?”
I couldn’t think of a reason to deny it.
“After all the hardship, there’s nothing waiting for me back home.”
“…What about Mom!”
“Huh?  My mom?”
“If you stay here, all the deposit money will go to her!”
Ah, that’s what she meant.
“Oh, that’s definitely motivating.”
I chuckled. Hyun-byeol raised her voice.
“Don’t just brush it off! Oppa, are you really going to stay here?”
“Why are you so worked up? I mean, it’s not like I can’t live here. Didn’t you know? I have more friends here.”
I tried to lighten the mood, but Hyun-byeol’s lips tightened.
After a long pause, she exclaimed in disbelief.
“………Friends? You, oppa?”
“….”
Ugh. Even I know that kind of reaction hurts.
