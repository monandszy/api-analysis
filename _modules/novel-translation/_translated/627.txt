##  The Abandoned City (5)
The corpse collector, Avet Necrapeto. A member of the elite criminal organization, Orculis, and once a member of the Round Table, now vanished. The familiar faces didn't end with him.
“I… I'm the Witch of Screams…!” 
The black mage, Lilanne Vivian.
“If he’s the martial artist in the crimson armor… then he must be…!”
The Blood Knight, infamous for slaying the former Royal Knights' captain and escaping. Not only were those who fought against us in the Dark Continent present, but the leaders and other high-ranking criminals we only knew through intelligence were also here.
Of course, there were some completely unfamiliar faces. Even though I had researched and studied the Orculis members, there were several figures whose identities remained a mystery.
‘…Are they newcomers?’
It felt that way, but I didn't feel they were easy targets. No, they wouldn't be easy at all. Noirarc had dominated the 8th floor, heavily investing in nurturing the next generation. I knew their strength well, having faced them directly during the Ice Rock Expedition.
Thankfully, the captain, with his troublesome tier essence, wasn't present. But…
“…”
Erwen's eyes flashed with killing intent as she faced them. Honestly, seeing her like that, I was worried about her impulsiveness. But...
“It’s okay. Don't worry about me.” 
Her voice, calm and composed, reassured me. Her killing intent faded as she spoke. Perhaps it was because so much time had passed since that day. Or maybe it was because she'd faced various events in the time that had flown by. Erwen seemed to have mastered controlling her emotions from back then.
“Even if it's not today... I'll kill every last one of them someday.”
“…”
“So it's okay.”
Well, her emotions didn't seem to have entirely faded. But that was a minor detail. After all, there wasn't much difference between her and me. In truth, I'm even worse in the eyes of the royal family because I'm guilty of treason.  But in terms of the intensity of our grudges, they are nothing compared to these guys. 
The Dragonslayer, Regal Vagos. He was one of the Orculis members.
Thump.
As the tense silence grew heavier, I took a step forward. Look at the number of them gathered here. That's why…
“Oh, have you given up already? This would be awfully boring then… What? Why don't you say something—“
I interrupted the arrogant words of the braggart.
“It's been a while.”
“Psh, finally, that big mouth of yours opens—“
“Toy collector.”
“…”
I wanted to rush into them like I had before in the Dark Continent, when I faced the Lighthouse Keeper. But I was bound by limitations now. Escape was our priority. If he decided to make a run for it, it would take an eternity to catch him.
‘…I need to find a transportation device soon.’
Therefore, I decided to put disciplining him on hold for now.
“Well, Toy Collector! Not bad! I’ll treat you like a toy after I kill you!” 
He tried to force a smile, acting as if my personal attack hadn't affected him at all.  But that doesn't make him any more mature.
“Why don't you try getting a new essence? If you search the world well, you’ll surely find one that—.”
“Enough.”
“…?
“Stop making fun of this friend.” 
A man intervened in our conversation. Seeing the arrogant jester remain silent, I could tell he held a high position.
‘Who is he?’
I was pondering this when Amelia, standing behind me, whispered briefly.
“Roland Banozant. Orculis’s vice captain.”
He was incredibly famous, despite his unremarkable appearance.
The Eye, Roland Banozant.
Rumors claimed he’d become the second in command ten years ago, assassinating the former vice captain with a single blow.
“Really? You mean that guy killed the former vice captain?”
“It's true. The former vice captain was exposed as an informant for the royal family, and he was eliminated by this guy.”
“Hmm, I see…”
Anyway, that relieved my worries. The vice captain being in Sector 7 meant the captain must be in charge of Sector 13. I wouldn't meet the captain today. 
Of course, that didn't mean the vice captain was an easy target.
“Yande, it’s best to avoid talking to that guy—“
A surge of magic power emanated from the vice captain, separating him from me and the jester.
“———!”
Amelia spoke, but I couldn't hear her words.
‘It’s not sound manipulation magic…’
It must be a skill.
I gave Amelia a reassuring gesture, telling her it was alright, and fixed my gaze on the vice captain.
“I believe that lady has already introduced me, so I won't waste words. I am Bjorn, son of Yande. I have a proposition for you.”
“A proposition…?”
I replied, ready to listen. The vice captain went straight to the point.
“A storm is coming soon, one that will swallow everything in its path. And a ship with holes can never withstand that storm.”
“Are you implying the ship with holes is the royal family?”
“Of course. Otherwise, why would we be here like this? Abandon your ship with holes and come join us.” 
The vice captain’s offer was slightly disappointing. It was too predictable. I was curious to know why he needed to silence us just to make his offer.
“…Can I take some time to think about it?”
The vice captain chuckled at my request.
“That means refusal.”
“No, why would you think that? I just said I’d think about it.”
“You are a person of interest to us.  We have done a lot of research on you. For you, saying that you’ll think about it means buying time.”
“Oh…?”
What the hell is this guy?
I was speechless for a moment, shocked by the accusation, but it was a reasonable statement upon reflection.
Just like baseball players analyze a pitcher’s habits,
These guys had analyzed my usual habits.
However, that’s why…
“What the hell is proper investigation?”
“…?
“If you really investigated me, you should already know—“
“…”
“What my answer would be.”
The vice captain didn't react to my sarcastic remark. He simply repeated himself in the same tone.
“So what’s your answer?”
“Refusal.”
“Why?”
“I don't know? I just felt like it?”
I gave a nonchalant answer, not wanting to elaborate.
He seemed to catch on.
“I hear you are very protective of your comrades. True, isn't it?”
He spoke in a flat tone.
“Riole Warve Dwarke. I hear his death had a significant impact on you.”
What the hell was he trying to say now?
“But it was the Dragonslayer who killed him. It was a reckless action. And he was said to have died after colliding with the Rose Knights while chasing after you.”
It sounded like a mockery. 
“Ah, you might not know about this. This is classified information, even within the royal family…”
He sounded like he was trying to persuade me.
“I hear you were too busy running away back then.”
It sounded like a threat.
“But… aren't you curious? Why were the Rose Knights there?”
Just how much did this guy know?
I couldn’t tell if his words were a persuasion or a threat. 
No, maybe…
‘Maybe he’s just trying to gauge how much I know.’
I maintained my poker face until the moment his skill deactivated. Everyday noises returned to my ears. At the same time…
“You are smarter than the other barbarians. You will surely find the answer someday.”
The vice captain spoke to me loud enough for everyone to hear.
“So we’ll let you go today.”
Finally, I understood why he’d approached me for a conversation.
He’d tried to persuade me.  And he’d done it in a very forceful way.
“Just go. We won’t stop you.”
This guy was entirely different from anyone I'd met before.
‘Damn, I should’ve just charged at him earlier.’
The poison in the well had been neutralized.
***
The vice captain gave an order. And as if by a miracle, a path to the wall appeared, opening up like the parting of the Red Sea. 
To top it off, he even offered…
“Oh, if that still makes you uneasy, I can send you to a completely different location.”
He even offered to disappear altogether.
I didn't understand the situation at first. But after calmly reviewing the situation, I finally understood.
“What did you talk about with the Baron…?”
“He suddenly offered to open the way, just like that.”
“Are they not trying to deceive us, to ambush us from behind?”
“But, they’re offering to disappear altogether, aren't they?”
We’re screwed.
Like that Korean diplomat who stopped an army with a few words.
He’d driven me into a corner with a few words.
[You are smarter than the other barbarians. You will surely find the answer someday.]
Even his last line was a meaningful statement delivered loud enough for everyone to hear. 
If we cross the wall without anyone getting hurt, the biggest loser would be me. 
The royal family would suspect me.
The people would also suspect me.
Noirarc letting us go means there must’ve been some sort of deal.
They couldn't investigate me before because I was a nobleman, but this time, they’d certainly conduct a thorough investigation.
And my allies as well. 
And then?
‘It’s over.’
The inevitable ending made my heart constrict.
Thump-
The vice captain probably didn't know whether I knew about the Rose Knights.  That’s why he tried to verify it. 
If I revealed that I knew, the royal family would eliminate me for them.
And if I didn’t, I would harbor a grudge against the royal family.
Either way, he would benefit.
‘What should I do?’
Should I order a mindless charge right now?
I was pondering this when the vice captain grinned and spoke.
“Too many eyes watching, makes for a tough decision, doesn’t it?  We’ll be on our way.”
Damn, he’s still doing that.
“Wait.”
I stopped him and quickly organized my thoughts. 
His plan had one flaw.
I understand how he could benefit from simply letting us through the wall. But…
‘Would they really go this far…?’
I still don't understand.
Why would they willingly give up Sector 7?
Is that what I mean to them, enough to make such a sacrifice?
What the hell does this guy expect of me?
As I was thinking this, a thought struck me.
“Ah.”
A possible answer lit up my mind like lightning.
What if?
What if it wasn’t because I was valuable, but the opposite?
For example, what if I wasn’t valuable, but Sector 7 just wasn’t?
That is, what if…
‘They never cared about Sector 7 in the first place.’
If I assume this, it makes more sense.
Then their real goal was Sector 13?
I’m not sure, but my intuition tells me that Sector 13 isn't any different from Sector 7.
That leaves only one candidate.
“How long are you going to—“
“Bifron.”
“———!”
That’s the answer, isn’t it? 
Grin.
Now I know what I have to do.
