The Guide (4)
I perched on the second-story windowsill, gazing at the burning city.
*Whoosh!* *WHOOSH!*
The flames writhed and swirled, threatening to consume everything. Yet, they were inexplicably halted at the transparent glass pane, unable to reach the building itself.  It was as if divinely protected.
Of course, such an expression only resonated with the sensibilities of a modern person. This world, however, is rife with countless mysteries.  Locals, upon witnessing such a spectacle, would immediately think of protective magic circles, artifacts, or divine incantations.
*“Hmm… but since it *is* a divine incantation… is it right to say it’s divinely protected?”*
Though the thought crossed my mind, Sven Parab shook his head. As a paladin who wielded divine power, he knew better than anyone. Divine power is merely a resource.  The Order, of course, preaches that divine power is a blessing from God, and that those who lose their worthiness will also lose that power…
*“Nonsense.”*
Sven Parab had witnessed it countless times—clergy unbefitting of their title, archbishops unworthy of their rank, cardinals devoid of their piety, and paladins who were anything but. They spoke of virtue and charity, yet their hearts were far from pure.  Much like his own.
……….
Even in his everyday life, Sven Parab pondered this. If divine power truly is withheld from the unworthy, then it should have been taken back long ago.  His very existence proved this hypothesis. He is, after all, an evil spirit who usurped the body of a good person, and even then, he hadn't lived a life worthy of a paladin.  But…
*“I’m not even a paladin anymore.”*
Despite leaving the Order, this so-called sacred power remained.  Therefore, the claim that divine power is granted only to the worthy is utter nonsense.  Of course, if you ask whether God exists… that’s a different matter entirely.
*[Did I receive a prophecy…?] *
Surprisingly, he once heard the Goddess's voice directly.  It was in a dream, where she showed him glimpses of the future, allowing him to avert a calamitous fate.  But that only deepened his questions.
*“Exactly… what does she want…?”*
What, exactly, do these so-called gods desire? They seem to truly exist, possessing the immense power described in the scriptures.  Then why is the world in such a state?
He remained seated by the window, contemplating this for a long time, watching the burning city.  Then, after an indeterminate period…
*Whooooosh!*
The flames swirled, but in a different pattern than before.  He straightened, focusing intently on the scene beyond the window.
“Damn it.”
The fire was being extinguished.
The extinguishing of the flames was hardly a good omen. After all, the situation now demanded far greater caution than the fire itself.  The flames had been protecting them; now, it seemed someone was actively suppressing the blaze, a fact that only amplified his unease.
*Thump!*
A sensation as if something had drawn closer. Sven Parab ignored it, quickly attending to his immediate tasks.
“Everyone, gather here, to the rear.”
He first assembled the refugees in one place.
“Miss Marone!”
After requesting Marone to activate the prepared magic circle, he returned to the second floor and observed the scene outside.
*Whooooosh!*
The flames dwindled rapidly, visibly losing their intensity. As the fire subsided, an army emerged from the smoke.
*Click, click.*
Heavily armed soldiers marched in formation, extinguishing the flames as they advanced.  He desperately hoped they were the royal army, but his wish, as always, remained unfulfilled.
*Click, click.*
Over a hundred soldiers were rapidly approaching. Sven Parab pressed himself against the wall, unseen, carefully observing the approaching force.
*Click, click.*
The soldiers were now directly in front of the building. Sven Parab sat with his back against the windowsill, focusing solely on the sounds.
*“Please, please, please, please, please…”*
Please, just pass by.  Again, he pleaded, but his wish was not granted.  Was it not obvious? Even if he were a Noirque soldier, seeing a single intact building amidst a burning city would pique his curiosity, prompting him to investigate.  Just like this.
*Thump, thump!*
The sound of someone trying the door downstairs was accompanied by a gruff male voice.
“Captain, it’s locked!”
The sound ceased. Sven Parab crawled towards the stairs. He saw the refugees huddled in the chapel, mouths clamped shut to stifle even their breaths, trembling violently—.
*BOOM!*
A heavy impact struck the door, and one of the refugees let out a short gasp.
“…Hmph!”
A tiny sound. But were they focusing on this location, even from outside?
“Oh, someone’s in there, it seems.”
“Don’t be careless, they could be Jandel’s associates.”
Sven Parab felt a sudden shortness of breath.
*“Jandel’s associates…”*
Could these people have come all this way because of us…? If so—
“Break down the door!”
*BANG! BANG! BANG!*
The Noirque began to batter the door with renewed ferocity.  Fear etched itself onto the faces of the refugees.
“Captain! This won’t break!”
“It doesn’t seem to be just the material’s hardness… it feels like some kind of magic is at play.”
“Right… This temple, even amidst all the burning, remained untouched!”
“Second floor! Enter through the window on the second floor!”
Yes, they were intent on getting inside, no matter how.  There was no longer any point in keeping their voices low.
“…What do we do?”
“Miss Marone, I’ll leave the first floor to you. I’ll handle the second!”
Sven Parab, rising from his crouched position—lest he be seen—said this, and then…
“Oh! There’s someone he—!”
He plunged his sword into the face of the man who had just peeked his head through the window.
*Clang! Thwack!*
“Sven Parab! Sven Parab is on the second floor!”
“Get him!!”
As he revealed himself, avarice flared in the eyes of the Noirque.
“That guy’s head is mine!!”
In a typical medieval battle, they would have needed a ladder to reach the second floor. But this is Rafdonia, a land brimming with arcane power. Soldiers, clad in hardened energy, scaled the second-story windows; ladders were unnecessary.
*Clang!*
Like ninjas, the Noirque swarmed into the second floor, breaking windows from all sides.  Their weapons flashed, fueled by murderous intent.
“Die…!”
A chaotic battle with over a dozen invaders ensued.  There was no strategy.
*Slash!*
His white greatsword swung, sometimes thrusting.  He blocked incoming attacks with the shield in his left hand; if that failed, he minimized injury by avoiding vital areas. And then…
*WHOOSH!*
He healed his wounds swiftly with a divine incantation.  Despite the melee, he could not utilize the advantage of his position.
*“Why is the staircase in the center…?”*
Sven Parab stood firm, guarding the only passage to the first floor, confronting the ever-increasing number of enemies.  But this wouldn't last. He isn’t Bjorn Jandel.
*Thwack!*
A blunt weapon, imbued with otherworldly energy, struck his head, sending the world spinning.  Divine magic healed him instantly, but he staggered back, losing his balance.
*Thump.*
He descended one step, making the fight even more difficult. The difference between a stable and unsteady footing was immense.
*Thwack!*
A thrown dagger tore through the muscles between his collarbones, embedding itself deeply.
*Thump.*
He retreated another step.
*BOOM!*
A magic spell? He deflected it with his shield, minimizing direct damage, but the force propelled him back another step.
*Thump.*
Advancing was arduous; retreating was effortless.
*“Right, how am I supposed to hold off so many…”*
His resolve faltered.  As if to prove it, he retreated yet another step.
*Thump.*
By the time he regained his senses, he was halfway down the stairs; the refugees were visible with a simple turn of his head.
“!”
“!”
The refugees closed their eyes, praying for his victory. But reality diverged from fiction.  Instead of inspiring him, their fear…
*Thump.*
He retreated again, weakly, not from injury, but to evade an attack.
*Thump.*
Another step.  As he was being pushed back by the onslaught, Lilys Marone, who was guarding the first floor, initiated her support.
「Lilys Marone cast the 5th-grade defense magic [Iron Wall].」
A massive wall rose between the enemies and Sven Parab, temporarily blocking the staircase.  This gave him a moment's respite…
*BOOM!*
“…It won’t hold for long!”
Even without Marone’s warning, the explosions beyond the wall confirmed the limited time available.
“…There are far more than we expected! What do we do?”
Sven Parab didn't answer. What do we do? I don't know. What can I even do in this situation to survive?
*Thump!*
His heart hammered, a grim pulse, as if declaring the absence of such a solution.  But is there a way out, even if the sky falls?
Sven Parab’s eyes suddenly fell upon a statue of the Goddess.
*“What…?”*
He couldn’t tear his eyes away. A hunch emerged—impossible to articulate—that the statue held the key to his survival.
*Tap-tap-*
While the magical barrier held, Sven Parab quickly ran to the statue.  While searching around it…
*“Huh?”*
He found a barely visible recess. He pressed it, and the statue smoothly slid back.
*“Could this be… an emergency escape route…?”*
There was no guarantee, of course.  But if there was a way out, it was this.  He was about to alert the refugees when…
*Thump!*
His heart lurched again, silencing his words. That damned instinct was still shouting:
*“Don’t tell them.”*
Don’t tell them.
*“If you want to live.”*
Only if *I* live.  The instinct, offering no evidence or reason, simply commanded it.  He couldn’t take it anymore.
*“Damn it, what am I supposed to do?!”*
This isn’t a game. Is this some kind of sick joke, toying with people’s lives like this?  Instead of relief at finding a way out, a bitter resentment welled up.  And at that moment…
*Thump.*
Something brushed against his limp right arm.
“?”
Looking down, he saw a small child looking up at him, a face teary-eyed.
“Sir Paladin… are you hurt…?”
……….
Sven Parab didn’t answer. Neither did he question himself. He simply pushed the slightly open statue further, revealing the hidden passage to everyone, then shouted:
“Everyone, down here!”
Even as he shouted, he thought:
*“Ah, I’ve done it…”*
He knew, no matter how hard he tried, he could never be a truly great person. If he was going to do something right, he could have done it much better.
*“Does this even suit me…?”*
The refugees descended the stairs beneath the statue. Except for the child who had worried about his pain, no one expressed gratitude. It was as if it was expected of him.  He felt no disappointment or betrayal at this.
*“Right… people are all the same. Self-preservation first.”*
Of course, this statement was paradoxical. Despite this thought, why hadn't he looked out for himself?  Why did he act for these strangers he’d just met?  As if this would make him a truly virtuous paladin.
“Mr. Parab…?”
Why did he do it?  As if anyone would reward him for this.
“Why are you just standing there! Come here! The wall is about to collapse!”
Sven Parab looked at the statue. The Star Goddess, the patron of exploration and fate, the one who revealed the path his destiny should take. Yet, as always, she revealed nothing.  Unlike this instinct, which revealed the path without him even wanting it.
*Thump!*
Come to think of it, what *is* this instinct?  He’d never really thought about it before, but it made no sense. He’d always considered himself lucky, with good intuition…
But not this much.
*Thump!*
The nature of this ‘instinct’ was unknown, but it was a blessing.  Because of it, he had survived countless crises. But now, for some reason, this thought occurs to him.
*Thump!*
Was this instinct always right?
*Thump!*
Because he followed this instinct, did he lose nothing?
*Thump!*
If he hadn't had this instinct…
*Thump!*
Instead of being a pathetic human trembling in a dark closet, could he have been a more virtuous person?
*Thump!*
Perhaps this ability is a shackle, preventing him from walking the righteous path.
*KRAAAASH!*
The wall blocking the staircase crumbled, and Marone, who had entered below the statue, cried out:
“Mr. Parab…!!”
The instinct spoke to him simultaneously.
*Thump!*
It’s not too late. Go down there. And…
*Thump!*
Abandon them and survive alone. It was a strong and specific instinct, unlike anything he'd experienced before.  But because of that, he could make a decision more easily than ever before.
“…I’m sorry.”
Sven Parab shoved Marone into the passage, then pushed the statue back into place.
*[…Do it!] *
Beyond the pounding of his heart, the ‘instinct’ now echoed in his ears.
*[…Hurry and follow! And you survive alone!] *
That’s why he didn’t follow Marone below. If he had, he might have succumbed again to the temptation he had barely overcome. So…
*[Hurry and go below—!] *
He struck his racing heart with his fist and said:
“Shut up.”
Thump…?
“Where I go is my decision.”
He raised his sword and shield, advancing towards the enemies pouring down the stairs.
*Thump!*
His heart pounded.
*Thump!*
More exhilarating than ever before.
