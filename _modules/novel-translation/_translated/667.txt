## Chapter 667: New World (2)
The materials required for the Immortal Mark’s inscription were numerous, numbering in the dozens. While most were readily available on the market, the three core components were different. These were byproducts of a formidable third-tier creature.
“Even more remarkable, all three possess high Essence value. Even those who dabble in ‘Distortion’ magic rarely capture them.”
In other words, to obtain these byproducts, one would need to personally engage the creature with a mage skilled in ‘Distortion’ magic. 
However, I hadn’t even begun the proper grind. The seventh tier had been largely occupied by Noark for years, preventing me from properly exploring that region.
“Ha-ha-ha! At long last, a worthy opponent for me to display my prowess!”
The moment the third-tier creature appeared, Baekho's team's tank, Rex Aureus, stepped forward. 
Then…….
“Woooooo!!”
Bone and muscle inflated rapidly, resembling my use of [Gigantification].
“Rex Aureus has cast [Giant's Blood].”
This was an active transformational skill unique to the Deep Sea Giant. It closely resembled [Gigantification] in its ability to increase size, though [Gigantification] focused on increasing ‘Threat Level,’ while [Giant’s Blood] prioritized enhancing raw physical stats. Naturally, as a third-tier Essence skill, the stat increases were significantly higher.
However…….
“There’s a fatal flaw.”
The increase in size prevents the user from wearing proper equipment. This is a drawback that also applies to [Gigantification], but [Giant's Blood], unlike [Gigantification], doesn’t benefit from the Immortal Mark’s [Unification] effect.
“So that’s why he always goes shirtless… despite being the team’s protector.”
The way he trained was remarkably similar to mine. I recognized familiar aspects immediately as I observed him closely. Despite his enormous size, the tights, which extended to his thighs, were intact.
“Stretchable magic pants.”
I used to wear them too. Before I unlocked [Unification], my undergarments would always rip when I activated [Gigantification], and later, they would melt due to [Acidic Fluids] at the slightest provocation.
“So equipment is brought out from the extradimensional space after transforming, I see.”
Aureus, now colossal, thrust his hand into empty space and retrieved a gigantic shield and an equally enormous mace. I instinctively nodded.
“Of course. A shield and a mace are the way to go.”
For strength-focused individuals like us, these blunt instruments are far more efficient than blades.
“Ha-ha-ha-ha!!”
Perhaps to attract attention, Aureus charged forward, immediately smashing the mace into the creature’s head.
“Thwack!”
The swing’s velocity and the heavy thud. Just from that, it was clear he could decapitate a fifth-tier monster with a single blow. However…….
The opponent was, after all, a third-tier creature.
“Kaaaaaaaargh!”
The creature let out a ferocious roar, not as a sign of pain, but as a display of anger. This was expected. Since he couldn’t wear armor, he’d need to focus on physical defense and resistance through Essence builds and raw stats.
“Anyway, that kind of damage output makes him a pure tank.”
But what about his tanking capabilities? That was answered immediately.
“Baterion has cast [Bite].”
Its claws, which were previously teeth, expanded grotesquely and latched onto Aureus’s shoulder. But…….
“Haaaa-ha-ha! Creature’s attack! This is just a tickle!”
Aureus, seemingly unaffected, burst out laughing and proceeded to wrestle Baterion, lifting it and slamming it onto the ground.
“Kaboom!”
Despite being a third-tier creature, it was astonishing. The sheer strength to lift such a beast, and the durability to only sustain a scratch after a direct bite.
“His level is surprisingly high.”
A sense of wonder mixed with understanding washed over me. It makes sense, though. To keep up with Baekho, he’d need to be at that level, wouldn’t he?
“Swoosh!”
Any scratches on Aureus’s shoulder were quickly healed by Jeina’s healing magic. Then…….
“Belveb Ruinzenes has cast the third-tier attack magic [Wind Song].”
The crescent-shaped magic spell severed one of the creature’s arms.
“Leighton Briet has cast [Seal of the Song].”
An invisible arrow shot out from somewhere, striking the creature’s body and emitting a radiant glow.
“Crackle, crackle.”
The light transformed into chains, ensnaring the creature, binding its entire body.
“Baterion’s abilities are temporarily sealed.”
Wow, he devoured that Essence? That’s a particularly rare and difficult-to-acquire second-tier Essence!
“This is crazy.”
Third-tier creatures are typically treated like raid bosses by regular explorers. Yet, they effortlessly subdued a third-tier creature. Their skills are truly exceptional.
“Baron.”
I was engrossed in the battle, observing them critically.
“How about you finish it off, Baron?”
Baekho spoke in a suggestive tone. He essentially wanted me to join the fight, to show him what I could do. I was curious about them just as they were curious about me.
“Fine.”
Knowing his intentions, I coolly stepped forward. I couldn’t go on observing indefinitely, and besides…
“…If I want to claim a share of the spoils, I’ll have to contribute.”
So…….
“Character has cast [Transcendence].”
“The next skill used will be enhanced.”
I used [Transcendence] in conjunction with [Gigantification].
“Move aside.”
“Ah, ah… Y, yes. Of course.”
Aureus, unaccustomed to looking up at someone, stepped back.  The difference in height must be over a meter.
“It’s not about that though.”
I wasn’t using a simple mace, one without a proper name, despite its massive size. This was the [Unification] enhanced, monstrously massive No. 87 Kraul’s Devil Crusher. I hoisted it over my shoulder.
“Character has cast [Swing].”
I showcased my signature move. It lacked the dazzling light and wind-whipping effects of other skills, but it was effective nonetheless. 
It’s strange, right?
“Whoosh!”
No matter how strong I am, how powerful a third-tier creature he might be. 
“Kaboom!”
It’s absurd to think I wouldn’t be able to subdue a creature like this, bound, with a skill and equipment of this caliber.
“Krgh… .”
What? Why didn’t he die in one hit? A bit flustered, I unleashed several more [Swings] and finally, the creature, drooling and writhing, stopped moving.
“Oh.”
The scene of violence, short and intense, concluded. From behind came a meaningful exclamation.
“…Wow, a tank with that kind of damage?”
Fortunately, it seemed to be a compliment. The way Baekho spoke, it didn’t seem like he was mocking his teammate.
“Our warrior couldn’t take it down even after twenty hits. Baron, wanna join our team? I’ll kick that guy out. Yeah?”
“…Baekho! Where did you learn to talk like that! I rely solely on Baekho, and now I’m treated like a traitor even by the Lord!”
Despite his size, Aureus seemed sensitive. Baekho’s words seemed to hurt him, judging by his outburst. 
“They bicker, but it seems they get along.”
I half-listened to their squabble and looked down at the motionless Baterion.
“Something feels off.”
In the labyrinth, a creature’s demise was signified by its corpse vanishing into light. The lack of such an effect made it feel like I hadn’t actually killed anything. It felt like it could get up and attack again at any moment.
“It’ll take some getting used to.”
Unlike the labyrinth, I felt the need for confirmation kills. It would be a disaster if I assumed a creature was dead and it came back to attack.
It was definitely less convenient than the labyrinth…
“But that’s the disadvantage and the advantage of it.”
“Havellion! You know how to butcher creatures, right?”
“Of course.”
“Then hurry up and grab the valuable byproducts. Keep the claws separately and give them to me.”
As soon as the battle ended, I requested the GM to butcher the creature. The claws, by the way, aren’t the typical animal claws; they’re the teeth on the creature’s hands.
Just then, Baekho, who had stopped mocking his teammate, addressed me.
“Why are you taking the claws, Baron?”
Because it’s one of the ingredients for the eighth-tier inscription…
I hesitated, a bit reluctant to be so straightforward. Baekho, however, smirked deviously.
“Ah, is it because of inscription materials? The thing is… you only need those claws for the Berserker and Immortal inscriptions. There’s no way you’ll unlock the Berserker inscription, Baron…”
“… .”
“So it must be the Immortal inscription, right? You’re still at tier 7, judging by you seeking these out. Wait a minute, so you can wear equipment and use [Gigantification] thanks to the inscription? The [Unification] at tier 5, right?”
Oh, that’s why I hate those guys who come from playing games. 
***
Baekho’s incessant chatter didn’t stop there.
“Wow… so that’s how it works? Fascinating.”
“… .”
“Knowing your Essence, I might find a docile Barbarian and train him exactly like you, Baron.”
“Baekho…? T, that’s not right… I can hear you… .”
“Oh? Plug your ears then.”
“… .”
He probably didn’t mean it seriously, but it was incredibly rude. 
The synergy between Essences, or between Essences and items. In this world, that’s considered a valuable secret, sometimes even called a ‘Vision.’ It’s valuable property.
“Ha-ha, just a joke, Baron. Oh, and the claws? Take as many as you want.”
Despite the annoyance, I made sure to grab what I needed.
“Anyway, I only need two more to gather all the ingredients for the eighth-tier inscription.”
Baekho could wait. There would be a time when he wouldn’t dare to make such jokes in front of me.
“Come on, everyone! Anyone done looting? Let’s get going!”
Leaving the Noark settlement, we headed northwest, continuing our journey. 
We encountered a creature roughly every two hours. 
“They said that creatures here are more intelligent than those in the labyrinth, and I can definitely feel it now.”
With each encounter, I realized why Baekho said that creatures outside the walls had far more intelligence than those in the labyrinth. They seemed to have their own unique hunting methods. They didn’t just blindly charge. Using the terrain was basic, but they also waited for us to rest, stalked us, tried to ambush us, and even turned around and retreated when they realized their ambush was failing. 
And if they were social creatures, their leaders strategized and commanded throughout the battle.
“…It really feels like a wild environment.”
They were like high-tier, unique variants, each deserving the title of ‘Named’ creature. They had varying sizes, and some had scars or even limped from injuries,  a stark contrast to the uniformity of the labyrinth.
“Alright, that’s it for today! Do whatever you want, but everyone meet back here by 7 am tomorrow! Okay?”
We concluded our day’s journey and prepared to camp some distance from Baekho’s group, when a raucous noise erupted from their side.
“Ha-ha-ha! Jeina! Ha-ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha!”
“…Stop it, Aureus.”
“Stop what? You’re just complaining after burning all the good food! Ha-ha-ha-ha!”
Baekho’s group was far more amicable and lively than I expected, especially with Aureus, the warrior, serving as the mood maker. 
“Even that Baekho is laughing. He said he doesn’t care about his teammates, but…”
“…Huh? Where are you going?”
“I just have nothing to do…”
I was almost finished setting up camp when the GM left my side and joined Baekho’s group. He blended in effortlessly.
“We have a lot of food left. Would you like some?”
“Oh! Really? Thank you! Our cook makes me want to skin my belly! Ha-ha-ha!”
I was surprised to see this sociable side to the GM, who always seemed like a recluse. But as I listened to the conversation, I realized it was simply information gathering.
“Ah, I see. I had no idea. I didn’t realize you were from Noark.”
“Ha-ha, really?”
“Ah, but I think I’ve heard something about you. Like, there’s a scary warrior who guards Noark’s gate.”
“Ha-ha-ha! It’s not quite like that!”
The GM, maintaining a lighthearted tone, eagerly gathered information from their lighthearted banter. But it didn’t last long.
“I have a question. Is it okay if I ask?”
“Ask anything!”
“Why is this a five-person team? Not six.”
The moment the question was asked, the atmosphere abruptly shifted. A heavy silence fell upon them.
“… .”
“… .”
What? Was that a question worth that kind of reaction? I had no idea, and I found myself leaning in to listen.
“Huh? Why are everyone’s faces like that?”
Rex Aureus, Baekho’s teammate, tilted his head, equally confused. 
“Right?”
“Yes, I think so.”
Baekho and the archer exchanged brief words.
“It’s not a creature. It’s a human.”
…What’s going on here?
