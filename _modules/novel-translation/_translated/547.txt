##  Chapter 547: Ghost (5)
**[Scales of Greed]**
An active skill with a high ceiling that grants the character "Magic Immunity" if their Magic Resistance is high enough.
But that's not all.
"Physical Resistance increases proportionally to the amount of magic damage reduced by Bellarios."
The skill not only blocks magic but also boosts physical resistance. In essence, it gives you versatile scales that become stronger as you're attacked by magic.
Truly, greedy scales indeed.
Unfortunately, I had chosen the wrong opponent.
"No explorer can outdo me when it comes to greed."
As the saying goes, "An explorer's ambition is a greedy ambition."
Well, I just made that up.
In that spirit…
"BEHE—LAAAAAAAAAA!!!"
I unleash the greed within and charge forward.
Essence, essence, essence, essence!
Essence, I must have it!
I feel like a madman with clear eyes staring back at me in the mirror.
It's been a long time since I felt this burning desire, facing a monster.
How can I resist? Because of my weakness to magic damage, I've suffered so many setbacks. This skill solves all of those problems.
Yes, that means…
"Let's take this guy down first."
Standing before me is the head blacksmith of the Goat-Headed Clan, the Healthsmith.
I bring my hammer down on the Healthsmith's head.
Kwaang-!
The Healthsmith's jaw shifted slightly from the impact, but it didn't even flinch, true to its reputation as a Grade 3 monster with exceptional durability.
Instead, it immediately counterattacked.
"The Healthsmith has used [Hammering]."
"The flame imbued in the earth awakens."
The ground splits apart, spewing flames into the air.
This was a near-fatal buff skill when our Tribe Leader used it, but for this creature, it was a passive skill.
After all, skills obtained from essence are typically inferior.
"All flame skill damage is significantly increased."
"Physical stats increase dramatically in proportion to flame sensitivity."
"Continuously burns the surrounding area."
Its entire body was ablaze with flames that burned so intensely they seemed to radiate a blue hue. However, the continuous damage was bearable.
Don't they say explorers rely on their equipment?
Oh, that's actually a real saying.
"Activated the [Flame Orb]."
"Reduces all continuous damage from flame-based skills within a 15m radius by 50%."
The Flame Orb was activated, significantly reducing the damage.
This benefit extended to the melee fighters nearby as well.
"Versil Goul랜드 has used Grade 8 Bestowment Magic [Cold Blood]."
"The character's flame resistance is dramatically increased."
Combined with the [Cold Blood] magic, the continuous damage was reduced to a level I could practically ignore.
So…
"Attack!"
Amelia summons her aura, and Misha swings her ice-cold blade.
And…
"Ainar Pnellin has used [Trident]."
Ainar showcases her newly acquired skill in combat for the first time.
Whiik-!
A sonic boom like that of a flying arrow as she thrusts her spear forward.
Two translucent spears appear on either side of the original spear.
The effect of [Trident] was to have these spears pierce the two enemies closest to the target.
But…
"It wouldn't feel right if it was only that, for a Grade 3 essence."
[Trident] is an area-of-effect skill, but it truly shines during single-target attacks.
Just like this.
"No enemies are within the attack range of the target."
"All attacks hit the target."
The three spears pierced the Goat-Headed's head.
It wasn't like [Multiple Slash], where the spears all landed in the same spot, so none of the skills I already possessed were activated.
However, that didn't mean it was weak.
Spear Penetration Damage increased by 1,200%.
Just this one option was enough to unleash the damage of a Grade 4 or lower essence combination.
Poook-!
The three spears that had pierced deeply were pulled out.
Blood gushed from the holes the spears left behind, matching the size of the spears.
However, it was a fleeting moment.
"The Healthsmith has used [Patching]."
The wounded area glowed red like lava, and a silvery membrane covered it, like when you get a cavity filled.
The Healthsmith, having quickly healed its wound, roared and activated one of its main skills.
"The Healthsmith has used [Hellfire]."
[Hellfire].
This skill was once used as the main skill for a specific build, proving its effectiveness as an offensive skill.
Pwooong-! Pung! Kwaaang-! Kwaang-!
It erupted like a volcano.
The Healthsmith's lava sack, strapped to its back, burst, spewing bright red liquid all over the place.
And…
"Bellarios has used [Disaster]."
Bellarios joined the battlefield, marking the start of a proper raid.
***
[Disaster] is an extremely unique skill.
It's especially notable for its ability to affect the field itself.
"Field Effect – Typhoon Applied."
A random field effect that applies to the area within its range upon activation.
Swaaaaaaaa-!
The wind howls, and a grey whirlwind rages.
It significantly reduced visibility, but that was just a minor effect of the visual effect.
"All skill activation rates are reduced by 50%."
If you use a skill inside the typhoon, there's a 50% chance it will be canceled midway.
"This is annoying. A typhoon right from the start."
At least it wasn't the Dragon Mountain Range. The range had its own field effect, making things a lot more challenging.
"Take down the Healthsmith first!"
The order was given, and the ranged attackers started unleashing their skills.
The combined magic, which they had been channeling for a long time, unfolds, and various abilities were fired at precise angles, avoiding melee attackers.
And just then…
"Bellarios has used [Dragon Orb]."
"Resource consumption of all characters within the radius is increased by 12 times."
A yellow light erupted in the middle of the blinding typhoon, emitting a holy aura.
I was wondering when it would activate.
"The activation mechanism was when a certain amount of resources was consumed, wasn't it?"
[Dragon Orb] was a skill as unique as [Disaster].
This ridiculously overpowered skill increased resource consumption by 12 times, recovering the consumed amount as MP.
However, it's only overpowered on the surface, as it has a fatal flaw.
"The Healthsmith has used [Patching]."
"Resource consumption is increased 12 times by [Dragon Orb]."
"Skill failed due to field effect - Typhoon."
"Resource consumption is stolen by [Dragon Orb]."
[Dragon Orb] affects both enemies and allies, like [Disaster].
This unique mechanism had led to the creation of a specific build.
A single-target carry-type character that had a focused damage build, absorbed allies' resources with [Dragon Orb], and unleashed insane damage.
It was nothing more than a downgraded version of Erwen, though, so I played it a couple of times for fun before discarding it.
Anyway…
"Don't stop!"
Ignoring the typhoon and the increased resource consumption, I poured all my damage into the Healthsmith.
As a result…
"Field effect - Earthquake applied."
"All movement-related effects are sealed."
Bellarios used [Disaster] again with the recovered MP, but we achieved our goal.
"Healthsmith defeated. EXP +7."
The creature, robbed of its MP and denied the use of its skills by its own allies, met a miserable end.
Swaaaaaaaa-!
Its body turned into a beam of light and disappeared, but there was only one reward.
Tuk.
A Grade 3 gem.
"I was hoping for something more since it's the first kill…."
The essence, which I was hoping for, didn't drop.
I was a little disappointed, but I didn't dwell on it too much.
I still had the main dish.
"Actually, this is good."
If beginner's luck had triggered here, it would have made me uneasy.
After all, you need a sacrificial offering in gacha.
"Now, only that guy's left!"
"You know the drill, right? Mages, stick to support magic! Don't use offensive spells!"
After defeating the Healthsmith, I focused all my efforts on Bellarios.
The mages switched from damage dealers to support roles, and the ranged attackers intercepted Bellarios as it floated in the air, unleashing their skills.
And then…
"Here it comes!"
When the flying monster finally descended, the melee fighters swung their weapons as well.
"Bellarios has used [Wave Wander]."
"Bellarios has used [Death Breath]."
"Bellarios has used [Shatter]…"
As the battle dragged on, the creature's scales became increasingly tattered.
"Bellarios has used [Disaster]."
"Field effect – Drought Applied."
"All beneficial effects are removed, and all negative effects are intensified."
It was around the time the monster used its third [Disaster].
Whiiiik-!
Erwen's arrow, fired from afar, pierced the creature's forehead, ending the battle.
Did it take about 10 minutes?
I calculated the duration of the battle in my head, but my eyes remained fixed on Bellarios as its body faded into a beam of light.
"Bellarios defeated. EXP +7."
The creature's corpse disappeared, leaving a beam of light in the air that condensed into a gem and fell to the ground.
Tuk.
None of the explorers were interested in the gem that dropped.
"No.9999 Beginner's Luck has activated."
The essence appeared.
The problem was…
"…It's yellow."
It wasn't [Scales of Greed].
***
The active skill of the yellow essence was [Shatter].
It's a single-target instant skill that is a ranged attack by default but gains significantly more power when used up close.
"Ugh… That's disappointing. Yellow? Not what you were hoping for, was it?"
"Well… What should I do with this essence? I'm sure there are plenty of people who would want it…."
While everyone was focused on the essence, Amelia approached, wiping blood from her dagger.
"Yandel, are you alright? You seemed hurt."
"Ah, I'm fine. My equipment is good."
"…"
Even when fighting Mila옐, a Grade 2 and a Rift Guardian, I was hardly injured. But I was still hurt after fighting Bellarios.
[Shatter] cannot be guarded due to its nature. The attack distorts the space around the target, causing damage.
Swaaaaaaaa-!
It was just a minor injury, though. With a bit of healing, it quickly started to heal.
"I'm glad you're okay, but what are you going to do with the essence?"
"Ah, that…."
I quickly gathered my thoughts, now that my body was back to normal.
"Why did it have to be [Shatter]?"
It's not a bad skill, if you look at it individually. It's an unavoidable instant skill, and it can't be guarded either. It even deals decent damage and has low MP consumption and a short cooldown.
But…
"It's hard to upgrade."
It has all those advantages, but it also has a fatal flaw—it's difficult to create synergy with other skills.
It means it has low growth potential, regardless of the skill build.
"I've decided."
It didn't take long to decide who would possess the essence.
"Auyan 록로브."
Our clan's only non-combatant, the navigator.
"…"
"This is yours."
"…"
"What are you surprised about?"
"W, well… This isn't a navigation-related essence, is it…?"
Ah, so that's why he didn't say anything when the Grade 3 essence was discarded.
I smirked and patted him on the shoulder.
"You're a member of our clan, even if you're a navigator. You need at least one essence to protect yourself."
I was planning to give him something suitable anyway. If it's an essence that's decent for anyone to use, even Auyan, a non-combatant, can utilize it.
"Its passive skill, [Ring of Circulation], can boost base stats, too."
He seemed to find it hard to believe.
"Uh, uh…."
Auyan just blinked like someone in a trance.
And how long had it been?
"Th, thank… you. Thank you… I… I really… really appreciate it…."
For some reason, the navigator started crying.
***
"The [Bellarios Essence] permeates the soul of Auyan 록로브."
***
What the heck, why is he suddenly crying?
I was confused by the sudden turn of events, but then Amelia came over.
"I guess it's all those years of hardship surfacing. He told me stories about how much he was looked down on as a navigator."
…Really? I didn't know that.
"You gave him an essence to protect himself, knowing how hard he's worked. It must have been overwhelming. It was probably the first time he felt like he was truly recognized."
Well, even though she said that, it didn't quite resonate with me. It was more like he just had a lot of difficult times?
I lost interest at this point.
"Ahem…."
"Wow! Bjorn is getting all flustered!"
It's not like that!
"Amelia, you're smiling so brightly again."
I was afraid of being misunderstood, so I quickly changed the subject.
"Everyone, go rest!"
Everyone had time to rest.
I was resting nearby when Erwen came rushing over.
"Bjorn, are you resting?"
"Yes, so?"
"I have a question."
A question?
"Ask away."
"Why did you prevent me from participating in the battle? It would have been so much easier if I had taken one down from the start."
"Ah, about that?"
She was right. If Erwen had used her ultimate, even two Grade 3 monsters wouldn't have lasted long. She could have obliterated the Healthsmith with a dark orb and then taken out Bellarios with [Focused Fire] in one shot.
But…
"We still have plenty of time left."
"Huh?"
Erwen can't participate in battle for a while after using her ultimate.
The current time was 5 PM.
In simple terms, if we were to lose Erwen, a high-level asset, at this point, the number of monsters we could defeat would decrease.
"Alright, I think everyone's had enough rest…."
I stood up and ordered everyone to assemble. After everyone gathered, we formed our battle formation and summoned monsters.
After grinding until 11 PM, we finished our daily routine and prepared for camp.
Then, the next morning.
"Chew thoroughly! There's not much vegetable in this batch!"
I started the day with breakfast.
Okay, the food is delicious today, too.
"With 38 people, we have enough supplies for 60 days."
No issues with logistics.
"I detected some unusual readings from Pnellin's body. It might be a clue to Hiprama전트's embodied ability."
The investigation team is as unproductive as usual.
Everything was perfect this morning.
Except for one thing.
"Yandel, can I talk to you for a moment?"
I was taking a stroll to help digestion when Amelia, the leader of the guard team, called me over.
She hesitated before speaking.
"It's not like I can just ignore it because they're claiming to have seen the same thing, but it's not like there was anything there, when I checked."
"What did they see?"
"First, let me tell you this. I checked thoroughly, but there was nothing in the library."
"But what did they see?"
Amelia cautiously looked around before whispering in response to my question.
"There are rumors that they saw… ghosts at night."
…Ghosts?
