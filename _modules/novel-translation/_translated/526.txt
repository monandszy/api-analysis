## The Giant Island (5)
The portal monolith stood within the cavern's depths. I was drawn to it, instinctively reaching out to touch its surface, but it remained silent. 
“As expected… even the Baron’s hand doesn’t work,” Erwin murmured, her voice tinged with disappointment.
It wasn’t entirely unexpected. Opening the portal had required specific conditions on my previous arrival, and I assumed this time would be no different. There had to be some necessary items I needed to procure. 
I scrutinized the junction between the monolith and the earth, noticing the telltale signs of excavation around its base. 
“There isn’t even any inscription this time…,” I muttered to myself, a hint of frustration creeping into my tone. 
So, I would have to keep blindly searching, hoping for a clue. I turned to Wyatt, the first to discover the monolith, seeking answers. 
“Did you check the monolith daily?”
“Yes. I’ve been coming here every day since I found it and placed my hand on it, but there’s been no reaction.”
Meaning there was no specific date or time for the monolith to respond. 
“Any unusual phenomenon or anything worth mentioning?”
“No.”
“You found the portal monolith, yet why were you so hesitant earlier?”
It was a question that had sprung to mind earlier. Wyatt’s unease when he first saw me, a sense of doubt that perhaps there was no escape, no way to leave this place. 
Why?
“… It’s not something we know,” Wyatt answered, his voice soft and hesitant.
“If this monolith leads anywhere… it’s not necessarily outside.”
“Ah…,” I echoed, acknowledging the truth of his words. 
This was a previously unexplored level, a frontier for human exploration.  Nothing could be taken for granted. 
If we activated this monolith, it could lead us back to the city or the first level as we expected. 
Or, it could lead us to an entirely different place.
“Maybe to a second underground level,” I mused, though the thought was far from comforting. 
Regardless, we needed to find a way to activate this monolith. The only way an explorer uncovers the truth is by exploring all possibilities. 
“How many people know about this monolith?”
“All those who were with us.”
Good. There was no need to keep it a secret then. 
“Let’s go back to where we were earlier,” I announced, concluding my investigation for now. 
I headed back to the rest of the team, including the Armin expedition, and shared the news of the monolith. 
These sorts of things require a collective effort, a synergy of minds.
“A monolith leading to an unknown destination… but at least we’ve finally found a clue, haven’t we?” Erwin remarked, her voice cautiously optimistic.
“Go ahead. Let’s brainstorm. What can we do to activate this monolith?”
“Perhaps capturing the giant, the one that’s said to be over 40 meters tall, might trigger something…,” Misha suggested.
“Maybe there’s something in the back of the library’s bookshelf…,” Ainar added, a hint of uncertainty coloring her voice. 
Ideas flowed freely, each member contributing to the conversation. I absorbed each suggestion, storing them away for future consideration.
“Perhaps the village chief might have some knowledge about this…,” Erwin said, her voice soft and hopeful.
It was a good suggestion.
“The village chief? Who is that?” I asked, pretending to be unfamiliar. 
“We’ll get there eventually. I’ll explain when we visit the island,” I replied, evading the question for now.
We continued our brainstorming session, each member contributing their own thoughts. Finally, we reached a decision. The Armin expedition’s mages and a few others expressed interest in further examining the monolith, while the rest took a well-deserved break within the cavern. 
Time passed, and as the next day dawned, we set about allocating our new recruits – twelve unpaid slaves – to their assigned tasks.  Our exploration resumed with renewed purpose. 
Time was slipping away.
“Nine days already…,” I muttered to myself, the weight of the passing days settling upon my shoulders. 
Technically, it had been 59 days since I began my exploration, but the time within this newly discovered labyrinth was distinct, its pace relentless and unforgiving.  
The rainy season was due to start in five days. We had to make the most of the remaining time to explore this island as much as possible.
“That rainy season’s going to be a pain…,” I lamented, the thought of being stuck for a week filling me with dread. 
It wouldn’t even be a week.
After the rains, the island would be crawling with monsters, rendering exploration impossible. And before the rains, we’d have to relocate to avoid being caught in the storm. Exploration would be put on hold again. 
“What are we going to do with them during the next rainy season, Yandell? Stay in that cave they found? Or go back to the village?” Erwin asked, her voice laced with concern.
“I’m leaning towards returning to the village. I have questions for the village chief, and if the Silver Lion Clan is still there, we can recruit more people.”
“Then we should leave the island in three days. That gives us enough time to reach the village.”
Only three days left to explore this island. It was a tight schedule, but with the increase in manpower, our progress was much faster.  We could now move through the island, mapping as we went, almost as if on autopilot. 
“Troll pack on the right!”
“Teirun Ervuias!”
*PANG-* 
Anything weaker than a Rank 5 monster was instantly vaporized by the concentrated barrage of ranged attacks from our team. They didn’t even have a chance to reach us. 
This was why explorers almost always moved in clans. The more people you have, the easier the exploration becomes.
The drawback, of course, was that you had to share the profits. 
“Sheritton, how’s the map coming along?”
“Good, Baron. Would you like to take a look?”
I had long since delegated the map-making to the Hekts Clan archer. He seemed to be several times better than me at it. 
We also had a dedicated scouting team. 
I had assigned a few people to Mikhail Lecter, a former member of the Royal Investigation Bureau. Now, they would constantly scout the area around us, providing me with critical information before anything unexpected could happen. 
Like this:
“Baron, there are three Nelpardons in ambush 3 minutes ahead. What would you like to do?”
What to do?
Rank 4 Nelpardons, and there were three of them. 
“Would we have to take a long detour if we avoid them?”
“Not really.”
“Then let’s bypass them.”
Nelpardons weren’t exactly worth the effort. I’d already gotten my fill of experience farming them in the library. We would skip them. 
By using this strategy – fighting when necessary, avoiding when possible – we could explore much wider areas with higher efficiency.
“The southern part is pretty much finished,” I declared, finally satisfied with our progress. 
We left the south, with over 90% of the map lit, and began expanding eastwards.
More time passed. 
I started to think about returning to our safehouse or setting up a campsite to rest when…
“Baron,” Mikhail Lecter, who had been scouting ahead, rushed back to the main group.
“We found a Hiphramajent. It’s sleeping, alone, 4 minutes ahead.”
Hmm… this was going to be tricky. 
***
Hiphramajent. 
The very same giant we had encountered while sailing towards the island. It had called for its friends, forcing us to make a hasty escape. 
The village chief’s book described how the giant had been partially submerged in the ocean when it was first discovered. 
Perhaps it was just an ocean monster after all.
“It only appears in the ocean?”
“No, it seems it’s not limited to the ocean.”
Finding it on land meant it was a creature capable of traversing both sea and land. 
Regardless, that wasn’t the important part.
“Alone?”
“Yes. It appears to be alone for now.”
“Scour the area around it, but don’t alert it.  There might be more of them like before. We’ll decide what to do after that.”
I sent Mikhail Lecter to scout further, and while he was away, I organized my thoughts. 
This giant was the kind that left a corpse behind. It had dampened my enthusiasm for hunting it, but I still wanted to take it down at least once. We would definitely encounter it again as long as we stayed on this level.
“If it’s alone, we should take it down and learn about its abilities,” I thought, my curiosity getting the better of me. 
What was its passive skill? Were there any undiscovered active skills? Knowing these things would help me devise a strategy later.
“There are no other creatures within 2 km of the giant.”
Mikhail Lecter returned with good news, and we immediately prepared for a raid. 
We adjusted our formation and devised a plan to counter the giant’s tendency to flee mid-fight. 
Then…
“Alright, let’s do this.”
Execution was all that remained. 
“Are you sure about this? Now?”
“It might wake up. There could be more of them coming back.”
Perhaps it was because it was a Rank 2 monster. Some members seemed hesitant, but there was no point in delaying any longer.
We stealthily moved towards the sleeping giant, then spread out in a wide circle to surround it. 
The mages and ranged attackers prepared their “strong opening punch” – but just as they were about to strike…
*UU-* 
The giant, curled up in a shallow sleep, raised its head and looked at us. 
Its ears were blocked by the mages’ silencing magic, so it couldn’t have been awakened by sound.
“Did it sense our mana?” 
Regardless, it was awake, so there was no need to be cautious anymore.
“Character has cast [Gigantification].”
I immediately activated [Transcendence], boosting my size and strength. 
“BEHE—LAA—AA—AA—AA—!”
Before it could fully rise, I slammed my hammer into its shin.
*KWANG-*
It wasn’t enough to break any bones, but it was sufficient to throw it off balance as it was trying to stand. 
*KUUUUUUUNG-*
The massive giant fell to the ground, kicking up a thick cloud of dust that obscured our vision.  
A common problem in the middle of a battle. 
*SSAA—AA—AA—AA—!*
The mages stationed behind us quickly dispelled the dust with a wind spell. With our vision restored, I charged at the giant and slammed my hammer into its jaw.
And in that instant…
*UOO—OO—OO—OO—OO—OO—OO—OO—OO—OO—OO—OO-*
The giant roared, facing me head-on. The air itself vibrated with the sheer force of its voice.
“Geez, that scared me.” 
For a moment, my hair stood on end, and goosebumps prickled my skin. It was a slight dent to my pride.
Therefore…
“UOO—OO—OO—OO—OO—OO—OO—OO—OO—OO—OO—OO—!!!”
I roared back at it, putting every ounce of my strength into my voice. 
It wasn’t planned, but surprisingly, it boosted the team’s morale.
“What are you all waiting for! Attack already!”
“Stay calm and follow the plan!”
