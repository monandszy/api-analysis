## The Giant's Construction (Event 2)
The fourth day, a day of reckoning for all the effort poured into the competition, had finally arrived.  Every seat in the audience was packed with eager residents, eager to witness the fruits of the competition's labor. At the heart of the stage, towering structures built by each noble house remained veiled by a grand cloth, piquing the curiosity and anticipation of the crowd.
"Hmph, the Baron of Yandell's building seems quite large, wouldn't you say?"
The assembly comprised the representatives, or their delegates, of each participating house.  The man seated to my right, a fellow nobleman, casually initiated a conversation.
"I'm extremely curious. I wonder what grand structures those reverse-warriors have built!"
There wasn't an ounce of sarcasm or hostility in his tone. It wasn't because he didn't consider me a competitor, but rather, he didn't seem particularly invested in this competition.  He seemed more interested in cultivating a connection with me.
"We're fated to meet, so do visit our house sometime. I'll treat you properly."
"I will, when I have the time.  But Viscount of Kiambrota, have you not visited even once since the first day?"
"Ha-ha, I've been rather busy, you see.  It's been difficult to spare the time..."
Busy, he said. More like, you just weren't that invested in this. Aside from him, only one other representative from the other houses had bothered to personally attend.  It wasn't entirely surprising, though. 
"Still, I'm looking forward to seeing our head steward's work.  Though, of course, with so many distinguished houses competing, we don't have high hopes."
It was their usual practice to delegate everything to their subordinates. So if they lose in this competition, it would be blamed on their subordinates' incompetence. 
"You're too modest, Viscount of Kiambrota.  Even if you didn't place first, at least you're safe from last place."
The nobleman to my left, a Baron, butted into our conversation, seemingly annoyed by our exchange.
That damn….
"Earl of Langlestone? Safe from last place? What exactly do you mean...?"
Ah, right. That's it. He was the only one among the representatives who displayed genuine enthusiasm, even bothering to visit the site. That's why he saw my building.
"Why, you've heard nothing about the Baron? The Baron of Yandell built a structure that has nothing to do with the competition's theme."
"..."
The Viscount, clearly privy to the matter, remained silent, his face strained.
Ugh, why are there so many people who pick fights even when left alone?
"..."
I chose to ignore him. The Earl lost interest after I remained silent, and the Viscount, looking as if a nuisance had interrupted him, returned to focusing on the event.
"Now, let's unveil the first architectural masterpiece, everyone's been eagerly awaiting!"
The explanation regarding the competition's judging process had finally concluded, and the moment to showcase the completed structures was fast approaching.
"Wooooooah!"
Amidst the crowd's roar, the first architectural marvel was revealed as the curtain was drawn back. The architect responsible, a skilled professional, stepped forward and engaged in witty banter with the host, elaborating on the building's features, his intentions, and the intricate details he had personally overseen. He emphasized its practicality by highlighting the realistic costs involved.
And finally...
"Now, let's begin the evaluation process!"
As soon as the presentation ended, the judging commenced.  There were three main evaluation categories.
Architectural Expert Evaluation – 25%
Noble Judging Panel Evaluation – 25%
Randomly Selected Citizen Evaluation – 50%
Each evaluation was applied according to this ratio, with a perfect score across all categories earning a total of 100 points.
"The total score is 71!"
The score for the first building was announced.  It was an impressive structure that would make anyone's jaw drop, and secretly, I had considered this opponent my biggest rival. However, the score was lower than expected.
The reason was quite simple.
The citizen evaluation was low.
"I can't understand! What's wrong with the building I designed?! Why are you giving me such a low score?!”
The architect who oversaw the design and construction yelled in outrage. The leading citizen voter, flustered, replied,
"Well, it's a beautiful building, but... it feels like it's from a distant land, not a place I belong.  And it's very expensive, too..."
"Hmph! You're joking!"
The architect scoffed in disbelief, but he didn't press the issue with the citizens.  He knew.  That picking a fight would attract unwanted attention from the higher-ups.  Though, even without further actions, he was already making himself look foolish.
"Tsk. With the citizen evaluation being so high... a fair competition is impossible."
The Earl, apparently shocked by the score, clicked his tongue. 
"Those lowly beings... what do they know?  I wonder what the Chancellor was thinking when he devised this format..."
Well, I think it's a good format.
The reason for the high citizen evaluation ratio was to enhance the entertainment aspect of this competition.  After all, this is the first major event after the disaster.  For the royal family, appealing to the people's emotions is much more important than a 'fair' competition. 
"Anyway, I'll have to tell the Duke about this.  He's been badmouthing you behind your back."
Despite the discontent brewing among the houses, the event continued.  One by one, the scores were revealed.
The Earl, who was next in line, presented a practical house with a blend of modern and traditional aesthetics, earning a score of 76.
The Baron's house followed, earning a score of 71.
And finally, the Viscount...
"The score is 69!"
He landed in last place with the lowest score, prompting the Earl to seize the opportunity to make snide remarks, pretending to console me.
"Don't worry too much. You'll be able to save face with your next turn."
He spoke as if it were a foregone conclusion that I'd remain in last place. 
As usual, I didn't bother to argue.  Actions speak louder than words.
"And finally, the last turn!  The one everyone's been anxiously waiting for! The Giant! The Baron of Yandell's architectural marvel!"
"Wooooooah!"
"For a special treat, the Baron will be introducing his building personally. Let's give him a roaring applause!"
The crowd erupted into a louder cheer as the host announced my appearance on stage.  The Earl glared at me as if I were a clown, frowning.
"How the nobles' dignity has fallen..."
He seemed to question why I was putting so much effort into this.  But I've learned through life that certain people should be avoided.  You can't get positive energy from them. 
"Baron of Yandell, I've heard your opinion strongly influenced this building. Would you mind giving us a brief explanation before the unveiling?"
"I strived to create a home closest to happiness."
"Oh! Is that so?  I'm extremely curious.  Well, let's not drag it out any further.  Show us!"
With the host's shout, the curtain was pulled back, revealing the building hidden beneath the cloth.
And...
"Wooooooah...  huh?"
The cheers died down instantly as the building was unveiled.  It was vastly different in appearance from the ornate structures shown before.
"Ha-ha... It's a building with a very simple and rugged charm!  But surprisingly, there are two of them! Could it be that you've chosen quantity over quality?"
"Yes."
"Ah, I see.  Indeed!  Considering that you're competing for the entire Ravigion district through this competition, work speed would undoubtedly be a significant factor..."
What's with this host?  Why is he so good at shielding me? 
Is he a fan?
Or did the Duke give him a separate order?
While these logical doubts arose, the host forced a smile and continued the event.
"Well, let's see what's inside! Now, let's all take a look together.  Oh, there are already multiple rooms on the first floor! It seems the living room is designed relatively small..."
"I'm sorry, but that's the hallway."
"...Huh?"
"It's ludicrous to even call this a living room."
"Yes, yes...  I understand that.  Ah, well, let's take a look at the first room now!"
The interior was displayed in real-time using a magic orb designed for recording, but the thunderous applause vanished like snow in the sun.
"...Ha-ha! A very compact room!  The structure is unique too.  Usually, small rooms don't have attached bathrooms.  Would you mind sharing the reason for choosing this structure?"
"I'll explain everything at once later."
"..."
The host was probably under the Duke's orders.  He constantly perspired whenever I refused his help.  But had he given up? 
First floor, second floor, third floor, fourth floor...
The host, while showcasing each floor and room, no longer attempted to artificially hype up the event.  Though, I have to commend his determination to never give up hope.
"Now, let's move on to the second building!  I wonder what incredible secrets lie within..."
"There are no secrets to uncover."
"Huh... ?"
"It's the exact same structure, so there's no need to go inside."
The host, his last hope crushed, finally closed his eyes.  But he didn't forget his role.
"...May we hear the explanation you promised, then?"
As I heard the host's question, I slowly looked around.
The audience seemed shocked, their expectations dashed.
The nobles had the 'I told you so' look.
The host's gaze pleaded for me not to cause any more trouble...
Tok, tok.
The atmosphere was ripe for a twist.
Yes, so...
"This house is small. It's not spacious enough to store many belongings, even if you live alone. It's not big enough for kids, or even for living with a spouse."
"..."
"There's no garden, no terrace to enjoy the breeze, and the kitchen is cramped, making it difficult to cook."
I blatantly exposed its weaknesses, stirring curiosity.  People naturally anticipate the next step when you present something this way.
"But!"
I shouted, loud enough for everyone to hear, even without an amplifier.
"I assure you, this house is the closest to happiness!"
"...Could you elaborate on why you believe that, Baron?"
"Because a world where everyone is happy doesn't exist."
Even with modern technology, achieving a society where all members are truly happy is impossible.
But, precisely for that reason...
"This house is a home for a happy future!"
I described our building with more passion than ever before.
"A house where you can dream of happiness, even if you have nothing now!"
"..."
"Even if we can't all be happy, it's a house built with the hope that we can at least have a 'chance' to be happy in the future."
It's a four-story building, housing a staggering 24 families.
"We call it the Happy Housing."
In simpler terms, it's a studio apartment. 
***
After finishing my explanation about the Happy Housing concept, I began my self-promotion.  
I discussed the realistic price and estimated rent. 
I highlighted how, despite its seemingly small size, the studio space was designed with practicality in mind, catering specifically to single-person households. 
"This price is cheaper than long-term stays in a decent inn, wouldn't you say?"
"But it's not just a wall... it's a storage unit... ?"
"No way! It turns into a dining table?!"
Perhaps because of the initial negative impression.
The public opinion swiftly turned around as the advantages were revealed one by one.
However...
"This isn't enough, though."
I also rolled out my prepared negative strategy.
This is, after all, a 'competition'.
Being last in line means I can't actually lower anyone's score, but changing perceptions can still sway the judges to award me points.
Therefore...
"How many people do you think will be happy living in the buildings you've seen so far?"
"...I'm not sure.  Most people might not be happy.  Even I would want to live there, but..."
"Well, I'd say over 90% of this city will be unhappy.  They'll be struggling with their monthly rent, and if they get injured, they'll have to work even if they're in pain.  They'll have to pay taxes.  That's the reality."
"Ah...!"
"Look at the structure.  How much space is wasted! It might look nice, but it's inconvenient to live in.  Plus, there's no storage space, right?  Those houses get dirty quickly once things start piling up."
"..."
"What about maintenance fees? Maintaining the exterior and lighting will require additional costs. Do you want to live in a house like that, even if you have to pay for it? And look at the pillars!  They're barely there, like the building will crumble with a single push."
By logically discrediting the earlier structures, the public opinion shifted even faster.
"Indeed... with that kind of structure, it would mean substantial cost savings."
"It's not like it's our house anyway."
"Those lowly beings might be perfectly happy in a place like that."
Even the noble judging panel seemed to be swayed.
"I tested the durability, and it's far more robust than expected."
"I checked the blueprint earlier.  The basics are implemented perfectly."
"It wouldn't crumble even in an earthquake."
"Ornate exteriors often mean weaker spots, but that building doesn't have any of those."
"With proper maintenance, it would last for a hundred years."
As the public opinion shifted, even the architectural experts started nodding their heads.
But could they tolerate this?
"How much longer will you keep us waiting?  Let's begin the evaluation!"
The Earl's complaint finally made the host snap out of it, prompting him to proceed with the final evaluation.
And...
"The, the results are in!"
Finally, the scores were tallied, revealing the Baron of Yandell's total score.  It hadn't been announced yet.
Duk-duk-!
My heart thrummed with excitement.
The air was crisp, my heart at peace.
I was completely calm, in a state of near-perfect tranquility, unburdened by any anxiety.
"With a total score of 72, the second place goes to the Baron of Yandell!"
"...Huh?"
"The champion of this competition, with a total score of 76, is the Earl of Langlestone! Congratulations..."
...Damn it.
***
I believe that second place can be more valuable than first place.  Being second place gives you the opportunity to understand your shortcomings better than anyone else.
"The citizens' votes were probably overwhelming in my favor, but the rest must've been the problem."
The noble judges and the architects.
They probably didn't resonate with my philosophical vision.  Those people are stubborn.
"Second place...  I guess I did my best.  It's only a one-point difference from the joint third place."
"..."
"Anyway, Baron, your eloquence was truly impressive. Of course, if the world worked just by saying things, it wouldn't be the world, would it?"
The Earl of Langlestone, rubbing salt in the wound, ascended the stage to collect his prize for winning the competition.  
I felt a fire burning inside me, but it wasn't enough to make me cry.
Had I already achieved more than I intended?
"Second place... that's all I need."
I felt sorry for the Earl, who was basking in victory, but in the end, the 7th district would be mine.  It's what the Chancellor promised.
He said that as long as I showed a modicum of success, enough to avoid looking suspicious to others, the Yandell Baron's house would get the contract for the 7th district.  
So, the true winner is me...
"Hmph..."
Why does this guy feel so annoying?
He only needed to send the first place winner to the stage, why is he calling us up?
As I watched the Earl of Langlestone, standing before the Duke, I couldn't help but glare at him.
"Light... ?"
A brilliant light flashed from somewhere in the audience.  My body reacted instinctively, much faster than my mind could comprehend the anomaly.
Duk-duk-!!
My heart pounded, sensing danger.
"...Magic."
Only then did my mind catch up.
"Dangerous."
It wasn't me who was in danger, it was them.
I didn't know what was happening.
"I have to stop it."
There was no time for deliberation.
The instincts of a Shield Barbarian took over my body.
"Character has used [Covetous Scales]."
"Character's Magic Resistance is over 500."
"All magic damage received is reduced by 50%."
So, I activated my skill and dashed forward.
Kwaaaaaaaaaang-!
The explosion erupted as I embraced my target.
Chii-ii-ii-ii-ik-!
A searing pain shot through my back.
And...
"...Su, surprise attack!"
Someone screamed.  Time sped up.
The knights surrounding the area rushed to my side, providing me with tight security.  I finally let out the groan I'd been holding back.
"Ugh..."
The pain was far worse than I anticipated.  As I unconsciously let go of the person I was holding, the Duke, as if snapping out of a daze, looked at me with vacant eyes and asked,
"You..."
It didn't seem like a question someone who had just survived would ask.
"...Why did you save me?"
Even I didn't have an answer.
"Uh..."
Why did I do that?  
Why did I stop it?
