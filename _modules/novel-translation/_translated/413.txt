## The Wild Mare (3)
“That… I’ve always had a good intuition, ever since I was little…”
Seeing my incredulous expression, the goblin started recounting his experiences as examples. His words were so scattered, I wondered if even he knew what he was saying. However, one of his stories stood out.
“The day the pillar of fire rose, it was the same! We were supposed to enter the Labyrinth, but I felt the same way I do today…”
Initially, I thought he was insane, but if these stories were truly his experiences, I couldn’t simply ignore them. After all, ‘intuition’ was a real stat in [Dungeon & Stone].
“I understand. Go back to your position.”
“Are, are you leaving now?”
“I can’t just keep pushing forward because of groundless anxiety.”
“…Y, yes, I suppose so?”
“Right. But, I’ll give it some thought.”
Leaving the possibility open, the goblin departed with an expression that read, ‘Well, this is the best I can do.’ Finally, my companions began to speak their minds.
“That’s an interesting fellow.”
The first to speak was the sorcerer, Old Man Didi, softening his original thought of, ‘Is he crazy?’
“Perhaps he received a revelation. He is a Paladin who serves the divine, after all.”
The mage Ashid seemed to be defending the goblin, while Erwen looked somewhat annoyed.
“Who is that guy? Everyone’s exhausted and needs rest.”
“Now, now, calm down.”
As I soothed Erwen, Amelia approached me.
“Shuytz, what are you going to do? You didn’t look convinced it was just nonsense.”
“Explorers don’t blindly believe in superstition. There’s always a reason.”
“So, you’re going to take his word?”
“I’m not sure….”
I had to ponder this. The truth is, as soon as I heard his words, a sense of unease settled over me.
Gently, I looked down at the traffic light ring I was wearing. The ring still emitted no light.
However, it was too early to relax.
‘This ring doesn’t foresee every event.’
It was the same in the game. The traffic light ring wouldn’t activate at a 100% chance for every event, it worked randomly. If the green light appeared, something good would definitely happen nearby. But, the lack of light wasn’t proof that nothing good would happen.
‘What should I do?’
Just as my worries deepened, the ring activated, emitting a brilliant light.
“The ring has detected the character’s fate.”
The light was a vivid crimson.
“Uncle…?”
Ignoring Erwen’s startled voice, I hurriedly stood up. Then,
“Everyone, prepare to move!”
We ended our rest and hurriedly resumed our march.
“…We haven’t even rested for ten minutes yet.”
“The team members are exhausted.”
The team leaders voiced their concerns, but there was no other choice. It was better to face a little hardship than experience a crimson event, right?
“Form up in ranks! We are departing now!”
We began marching again, and about half an hour passed.
“The ring’s light has extinguished.”
I couldn’t know what kind of negative event was approaching us… It was all bewildering and absurd.
‘Sven Parav, what is this bastard up to?’
Could it have been just a coincidence? Even with highly developed intuition, how could a person’s senses be wider than the traffic light ring?
Despite those thoughts, I couldn’t shake off the image of him trying to convince me with a sincere expression about his intuition.
Therefore, as we moved, I fell back and stood next to the goblin.
“How are you feeling now? Any better?”
My plan was to dismiss it as mere coincidence if he still seemed worried. He didn’t know about the traffic light ring.
“A, yes… I, I feel fine.”
What is this guy…?!
***
The seventh floor, the Dark Continent.
A human man with a physique as strong as a Barbarian lowered his waist and gently stroked the ground.
“Baekho, someone has been here!”
“Oh? How many?”
“A bit over twenty, I think. I can’t be sure. But one thing is certain: They haven’t been gone long!”
His booming voice fit his large frame. The old man frowned, but muttered a short reply.
“Perhaps it could be those individuals.”
“Those individuals?”
“You know. The ones who shattered the Eye of the Sky and are on the run.”
“Ah, those bastards… ”
“Shall we follow? If it truly is them, we could demand quite a lot from the Noark side this time.”
“Hmm.”
The blonde man pondered the old man’s words, then grinned and stared at something.
“Meow-meow, what do you think?”
His voice held a mischievous glint. 
The Beastkin woman merely frowned in displeasure, offering no answer.
“Well, I can tell just from your expression. You don’t want to, right?”
“…It’s a waste of time.”
“A waste of time, you say? If you’re truly a city dweller, you just don’t want to get involved, right?”
“…”
“Such a lack of excitement.”
As their conversation ended, the warrior who first discovered the tracks asked in a quiet voice.
“So, what will we do? Follow?”
“No. Why bother?”
The blonde man shrugged and continued.
“It’s not even certain, right? What if we go and they’re just hunting around?”
“It would be a waste of time. But isn’t it a pity? If we follow now, we can catch up quickly.”
“Nah, forget it.  Like they’ll have anything amazing even if we catch them.”
The blonde man waved his hands in dismissal, then pulled a chair out of his subspace and sat down.
“If we encounter them by chance, that’s fine, but there’s no need to follow and confirm. Let’s just focus on our business. Don’t worry about them. They’ll figure it out.”
“If that is your wish, then there is nothing I can do.”
“Okay, so that’s settled. Let’s rest for a bit, eat something, then head out. Hey, Aures!”
“Ha-ha! Give me just a moment! I’ll grill some delicious meat for you!”
Soon, the smell of grilling meat began to fill the air around them.
***
Sixty days since entering the Labyrinth. In other words, fifteen days left until the seventh floor closes.
“We’ve come this far.”
We arrived at the ‘Fallen’s Rest’, the western field of the ‘Dragon’s Heart’, where the portal resides.
The black fog enveloped the area, impervious to the strong wind. Countless rusted swords were embedded in the endless field. The place held a chilling atmosphere, but none of us spoke of it. We were all too busy to indulge in such contemplation.
“Shuytz, we need to keep moving. If we stand still and get surrounded, it could be —”
“I know. Just be quiet.”
“… ”
Was I too harsh? It dawned on me too late, but I didn’t apologize. I didn’t have that kind of luxury. 
“Shuytz, don’t be so anxious. If the commander collapses, everyone will fall.”
Huh, I didn’t expect to be comforted in this way.
I sighed, a bitter smile creeping onto my face.
‘Don’t be anxious, is an impossible request.’
My plan was already ruined. Instead of heading south towards our allies, we were in the north, enemy territory. I thought we could endure here, utilizing the principle that the closest things are hardest to see.
But, how did things turn out?
‘Those persistent bastards.’
We had to keep moving. Even the slightest delay brought the pursuit force immediately. Because of them, we couldn’t rest or even sleep properly, and had been forced to march for days.
“I don’t understand. How do they know where we are going? How do they manage to follow us everywhere?”
Kaislan wondered how the Noark force had managed to track us, but I knew the answer. I had experienced this before.
[If I hadn’t sacrificed another arm, we might have lost them.]
In Larkaz’s Labyrinth, the Dragon Slayer used the priest of Karui to track us. They probably used a similar method this time. They’d sacrifice anything, even offerings, to achieve their goals.
“Parav. How are you feeling now?”
“A, I think I’m okay… ”
The goblin was largely responsible for preventing any further deaths until our arrival here. Somehow, he could sense when the pursuit force was nearby, even when we were resting. 
Whenever I cautiously asked if we could go in another direction, there was an ambush waiting ahead. From that point on, I kept him by my side, making him walk next to me even during our marches.
“Then you can rest a bit more. If something strange happens, tell me immediately.”
“Understood.”
The goblin collapsed onto the ground as soon as I said that.
Hah, if he’s that comfortable, it means this area is truly safe.  I want to lie down and get some sleep, even for a little while.
But…
‘I can’t.’
I fought back my weakness and gathered the team leaders for a high-level meeting.
“Kalla, Kaislan, Jun, Akuraba. First of all, I apologize.”
“…?”
“I thought we could hide here until the closing date, but I was wrong.”
Was it a sudden apology? The team leaders looked puzzled, then each offered words of comfort.
“I don’t think you have to apologize.”
“Yes. Even if we had stayed there and waited for reinforcements, it’s unlikely we would have lasted even a day, considering the pursuit force.”
“If it weren’t for you, more people would have died.”
“It’s embarrassing to say, but I was relieved I wasn’t the commander. As I said before, the commander is a figure who cannot falter.”
Oh, thank goodness. That made me feel a bit lighter. Lately, I’d been having a lot of those kinds of thoughts.
What if we had just waited for reinforcements in Deadwood?
Should I have risked more sacrifices and headed south to escape enemy territory?
And…
What if my wrong choices cause everyone to die?
My chest felt like it was carrying a mountain-sized rock.
However, I couldn’t ignore my duty, even if it meant an even bigger rock would crush my chest.
“Ahem.”
“You seem a little embarrassed.”
What are you talking about?
Tap, tap.
I patted my knee and spoke to the team leaders.
“Anyway, I called you here to hear your opinions.”
“It seems you’ve already made a decision.”
Well, yeah, but that’s just what I’m thinking. I haven’t made a final decision yet. 
Therefore…
“As you all know, I don’t think we’ll be able to hide here for long.”
I laid the groundwork before getting to the point.
“If we don’t keep moving, we’ll be quickly caught up and surrounded.”
We’re like sharks who have to keep moving to breathe.
Stopping carelessly will be game over.
If they fully surround us, our exhausted team wouldn’t be able to break free.
So…
“Where are you thinking of going?”
I felt a bitter pang of guilt as I looked at the team leaders, their eyes filled with curiosity.
“You seem to have a destination in mind.”
That’s right.
I do have a place in mind. It’s not something I thought of after we got here, but a place I’d considered from the planning stage. It was Plan B, so to speak.
An option I wouldn’t have wanted to choose unless the situation was truly dire.
“I’m curious. Where are you planning to go in this situation?”
I finally uttered those words.
“We are returning to Icerock.”
Our hardship will be their hardship.
Come on, follow me this far.
