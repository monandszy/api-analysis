## The Librarian's Secret (Chapter 448)
The sound of clicking heels echoed through the empty library.
"Woman, what is your name?"
"...Harin Suehbi."
"Your name is as unusual as your appearance."
My words, if spoken by a human, would undoubtedly be considered racist. But of course, as a barbarian, I had immunity in the world of discrimination. 
"It's understandable if you find it strange," Harin said, without any sign of offense. "Families like ours, with such strong Eastern bloodlines, are rare in this city now."
"Were your ancestors from the East?"
"Yes. My ancestor, a merchant, was fortunate enough to be in this city during the downfall. He survived and escaped the disaster."
"...I see."
It was a concise explanation, leaving no room for further questions. I was the one feeling bewildered. 
"Evil spirits don't usually know this much about their family lineage..."
"Maybe it's different for 현별."
I dismissed my doubts and moved on to my next question.
"What's your relationship with Countess Peprok?"
"I've been fortunate to serve her as her attendant for some time now."
So, she hasn't been there long, has she? My suspicions grew stronger. But...
Click.
Sadly, we arrived at our destination before I could interrogate her further.
"I shall take my leave now."
"Thank you, Harin. As always."
She bowed politely and stepped aside. I, too, decided to leave my suspicions behind and focus on the present.
...
Blue eyes, blue hair. Her hair was pulled back, revealing her graceful neck, and she exuded the aristocratic aura peculiar to the nobility. But...
"It's been a while, Bjorn Jandel."
Her tone remained the same. The unfamiliar appearance made me feel awkward for a moment, but I quickly felt a sense of warmth.
"It has been a while, Ragna. Or should I call you Countess Peprok now?"
"You're still as playful as ever."
Playful? I was simply confirming. Besides, by not addressing her as Baroness, I could infer what kind of relationship she desired to some extent.
"You seem to have changed a bit, though."
"Really...?"
Was it because of her hair? Ragna muttered, lightly touching her hair. But the truth is, she had a more mature aura, regardless of her hairstyle or clothing.
Before, she seemed fragile underneath her gruff exterior, making her feel somewhat unstable. Now, however, she carried herself with a heavier, gentler presence.
"I never imagined, Jandel, that you would still be alive."
"Neither did I. I knew there was a reason, but I never thought you would be the Chancellor's daughter."
"...What do you mean? The Duke's daughter?"
"...Didn't I say that?"
"No! It's not… If what you say is true, then some of my questions would be answered... but..."
What in the world was happening?
***
"First, we need to clarify this. Jandel, where did you hear that I'm the Chancellor's daughter?"
"Well..."
"If you can't reveal the source, at least tell me how reliable it is. I beg you."
"I thought it was reliable information. At least until I met you."
"So, a credible source..."
Hmm, is that how it works?
I don't even know the Stag's face or name.
Bewildered by the sudden turn of events, I tried my best to remain calm.
"Would you... be willing to tell me your story? Perhaps after hearing it, I could offer some advice on this matter."
Ragna pondered my request for a moment before opening her mouth cautiously.
"...Alright. It's not something I can keep hiding forever."
"...Okay."
"Besides, it's not a story that needs to be hidden."
Her change was evident in those words. Before, I would have asked her several times, and she would only respond with a sad gaze, refusing to answer.
Her mature aura originated from within.
While I was silently impressed, Ragna started her tale.
"When I was a child, the nanny who raised me alone always told me, 'Ragna, you must live a quiet life, unseen by others. It's the only way to repay him.'"
"..."
"As you know, I'm not actually from the Peprok family. My father simply borrowed the name of a fallen house to create an environment where I could live alone."
"I see..."
"I don't know who my father is, but my nanny said he was a very important noble. She also said that if my existence were revealed, it would cause great trouble. Oh, she also said that although he couldn't meet me directly due to certain circumstances, my father loved me and was always watching over me."
"..."
"I loved my nanny, but I didn't believe her when she said my father loved me. However, I decided to follow her words. I lived a quiet life, hiding myself, and gave up my only hobby, magic. I simply enjoyed learning magic, but somehow, I kept attracting attention."
That explained why a magician, who was at least a level 5 at a young age, was working as a librarian.
"Like I said, I loved her. Enough to give up even a small amount of ambition."
"Is it... by any chance… Ritanyiel?"
"Yes, that's right."
No wonder Ragna's name only appeared in the registry as Countess Ragna Peprok.
It wasn't her full name.
"What about your mother? Do you know what happened to her?"
"I was told she passed away the day I was born."
"I see..."
Hearing Ragna's story, delivered in such a calm tone, cleared most of my doubts.
However, the real important part was about to begin.
"So, what happened after that?"
What had happened to Ragna during my absence from the past that made her, a woman who had wanted to live a quiet life, suddenly become a Countess?
"Jandel, not long after the royal family announced you were an evil spirit, Duke Tercerion approached me with a proposal."
"...The Duke?"
"Yes. He offered to revive the fallen Peprok family in exchange for me working under him. I accepted his offer."
Ragna's story was completely unexpected.
"Why would you do that? You didn't even know the Duke was your father then, did you?"
"That's why I initially refused, of course. My nanny was gone, but I had spent my entire life hiding, so I felt awkward about stepping out into the world. But… I changed my mind after hearing what the Duke wanted from me."
"Tell me."
"The Duke wanted me to take the lead in convincing people to accept evil spirits as citizens of the city."
"..."
That's why Ragna brought up the integration proposal in the royal council.
However, there are still things I don't understand.
A fundamental question that permeates this whole story.
Besides the Duke's reason for making that proposal,
"Why did you change your mind after hearing that proposal?"
Why did Ragna want to integrate the evil spirits?
Finally, she spoke.
"I know, you see."
The answer was simple.
"That there are good people among the evil spirits."
"..."
"So… I didn't want my friend to be remembered as one of those people."
As I remained speechless, Ragna looked away and asked in a small voice.
"Is... this reason… strange? To you?"
I let out a sigh I'd been holding back and answered.
"Yes, it's strange."
To be honest, Ragna and I weren't that close. Or rather, that's how I saw our relationship.
Somewhere between friends and acquaintances.
We'd be happy to see each other, but if we didn't talk for a while, we would naturally drift apart.
Yes, that's how it was supposed to be…
"Ugh, well… I, that's—."
Before I could be misunderstood any further, I quickly interjected.
"But."
"...?"
"Thank you, Ragna. I'm truly grateful."
There wasn't anything else to say.
***
"..."
"..."
How long did that awkward silence hang in this vast library?
Finally, I broke the silence.
"The letter you gave me, there was no time on it."
"Ah… I… I was in such a hurry that I forgot to put it on."
I figured as much.
I chuckled and asked again.
"You seem to have arrived quite a while ago. How long were you waiting?"
"...Not very long, so don't worry."
Well, if that's the case then.
Anyways, the topic naturally shifted to the library closing.
I was a little surprised, too.
Sure, as a Countess, it wasn't impossible for her to rent out the whole library for a day, but…
"I never thought you would do that."
"It wouldn't be good to attract attention."
Honestly, I had the same thought. But...
"So, you decided to use your power?"
I teased her playfully.
To my surprise, Ragna answered boldly and directly.
"Yes. Is there a problem? It's alright, you know. To be selfish for once..."
Well, I guess I can't say anything to that.
After that, I tried to lighten the mood with some small talk.
We talked about the recent happenings in the world, like the whereabouts of Shavin Emue, a member of our old friend group.
We had a few laughs during our conversation.
But then, I got down to business.
"Ragna, I need to talk to you."
It wasn't about what I had intended to talk about today.
I had planned to subtly extract information about the Duke's family and, if the opportunity arose, try to recruit him as an ally.
Yes, that was the original plan. But...
"Do you have any intention of giving up your title as Countess?"
After hearing her story, I just couldn't do it. All I wanted was for her to simply disappear from this power struggle, since she had already been of help.
Of course, my expectations were immediately shattered.
"I don't know why you're asking, but no. I have no such intention."
"Why? Because the Duke might be your father?"
"That's irrelevant. Regardless of the truth, I will always be estranged from him."
"Then why do you insist on staying as Countess? Now that I'm back and the misunderstanding has been cleared, there's no need for you to do that, is there?"
"Because it's the most valuable thing I can do. Out of everything I'm capable of."
"...I don't understand."
"I've reviewed countless cases to understand this issue and formulate a policy that would allow this proposal to pass. To prove that not all evil spirits are wicked."
"...So, you've become genuinely invested in this issue, regardless of me?"
"Yes, in short, that's right."
It was clear she wasn't just making empty promises.
Ragna was sincere now.
"Whew..."
I changed my approach to persuasion.
"Then how about getting out from under the Duke's authority, even if it's just a matter of formality? It seems like he has no intention of letting this proposal pass anyway."
"...What do you mean?"
"I heard that the Duke was the one who most strongly opposed this proposal when it was first mentioned in the royal council."
"That… is something I found strange, too. However, the Duke said it was because he felt the basis of the policy I brought up was weak, so he stepped in before other nobles could attack it."
"...What?"
"He said that if I bring up a revised policy that can convince even the other nobles, he will fully support it then."
"Do you believe that?"
"Why wouldn't I? That's why the Duke called me here in the first place."
That's… true on the surface.
I had tried to sow discord, but I still don't fully understand the Duke's true intentions.
Why did he bring Ragna, who was living a peaceful life, into this mess? Why did he propose the integration proposal to her first—
"Jandel, you seem to dislike the Duke."
Ragna asked me then.
Her tone was a little sharp, unlike before.
"...He said he'd be estranged from me forever. Could it be because of the possibility that he's her father?"
Blood ties can be a tough thing to cut off, even if you want to.
Tsk, things have gotten a little complicated.
"I don't dislike the Duke, specifically. I just… think his intentions towards you are a little suspicious."
I hurriedly clarified, trying not to damage our relationship with Ragna.
Fortunately, she seemed to believe me.
"I see. Jandel, I understand what you're worried about. But… don't worry too much. I can take care of myself now."
What a jealous-inducing statement.
"Taking care of yourself..."
I still can't quite do that, can I?
***
I left the library around noon, just after Ragna received a call.
"Harin, the Duke wants to see me...?"
"Yes. He said he'll tell you more when you meet."
"...Why would he want to see me? Don't worry. I was about to leave anyway because I'm starving."
"I'll get in touch with you later."
"Alright. Like I said, don't tell the Duke we met."
"Of course. I don't want the Duke to use our friendship for political gain. Oh, Harin is also discreet, so don't worry."
Ragna left with Harin, her Eastern bloodline secretary, and I watched her leave for a while.
"Harin…"
I gained quite a bit of information about Harin while chatting with Ragna.
They met about a year ago.
At the library, where I had been just now.
Ragna, who had continued to frequent the library after quitting her job as a librarian to gather materials for her integration policy, met Harin there and became friends.
And...
"She seems to have taken a liking to Harin and, because she's quite capable, recently revealed her true identity and hired her as a sort of secretary and strategist."
That's what happened between them.
"Harin... must be 현별, too."
It's almost certain Harin is 현별.
There's no other candidate, to put it plainly.
Besides, Ragna doesn't have any other attendants besides Harin.
However, the problem is...
"If she's 현별, then she definitely knew. You can tell she's a noble just by looking at her clothes. She definitely approached Ragna deliberately, building up a sense of trust and becoming friends."
Understanding the situation, I felt a twinge of worry.
"You've been hanging out with someone important lately."
The 'important someone' 현별 mentioned.
"I'll use that power to help my brother."
Did she really mean Ragna?
Thump, thump.
If not…
"...No. When I asked her who she worked for, she didn't seem like she was lying."
I shook my head.
I'm confident I know 현별 quite well. It's more plausible that I'm overthinking than 현별 deceiving me.
"Ragna Ritanyiel Peprok has a secret."
A colossal secret I don't know yet.
