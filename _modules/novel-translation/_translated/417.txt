## Chapter 417: Eye of the Storm (3)
It was just a short murmur, revealing his name. Yet, the reverberations were anything but small.
"Crazy…!"
One person exclaimed, sounding utterly shocked.
"So that's why he did those things so naturally, like breathing."
Another person nodded in understanding.
"But wait a minute, isn't this a big deal? If it's Bjorn Yandel, the Viscount, then surely..."
And yet another person voiced their concern, laced with suspicion.
I quickly interjected before more unnecessary words could be spoken.
"The word 'evil spirit' isn't true, so don't worry. I can't disclose the details, but I agreed with the Royal Family to feign my death and release that information."
Of course, that was a lie.
But it seemed like a plausible explanation, because the team members were calmer than I expected.
"Now it makes sense. It's impossible for the Royal Family to entrust such an important position to an unknown explorer..."
"So that's why the Blood Witch followed him?"
"Honestly, I couldn't believe a man like him had suddenly died in the Labyrinth..."
"But what were the circumstances, that he spread false information about being an evil spirit...?"
Perhaps it was their inherent explorer's curiosity, but even in this situation, the team members showed a keen interest in me.  However, this wasn't the time to explain everything in detail.
"I'll explain someday, when the opportunity arises.  That's not important right now."
I cut the chatter short, and James Karla, who had been staring with his mouth agape, finally regained his composure and asked, "Shwetz, I mean Bjorn Yandel...no, Viscount Bjorn Yandel!"
He seemed so flustered, it was almost adorable. 
"I, I don't understand.  Why would the Royal Family use you as a pawn?"
I let out a chuckle at his question.
"Well..."
I have many suspicions.
"A hero of an explorer who earned a noble title after decades, for saving many people."
It's not something I like saying out loud, but that's me.
"From their perspective, wouldn't it have been easier if I simply disappeared? Especially if they had to go back on their words about me being an evil spirit."
"Ah..."
James Karla looked convinced.
But the truth is, this isn't the end.
I can't tell them the whole story, but the Duke probably knew about my true nature as an evil spirit a long time ago.
No, he definitely did.
But he still sent his son to confirm whether I was an evil spirit or not…
"He was just trying to deceive me."
Those who believe they are deceiving others are hard-pressed to believe they are being deceived themselves.
"Alright, that's the end of my story."
I glanced around the team members as I spoke, questioning them with my gaze.
"What about you?"
Raven started.
"I was left in a coma, and thanks to the 'Agent' of the Tobera Cult, I managed to regain consciousness. As a result, I was confined by the cult. If they needed a magician to use as a pawn, there was no better choice than me."
Bercil Goul랜드.
"My granddaughter died last year.  There's no evidence, but it was at the hands of a knight affiliated with the Duke's family. I've been searching for that knight ever since. Perhaps he approached me knowing this."
Didi, our team's esper.
"I accidentally discovered that the Master of the Magic Tower is conspiring with the Royal Family. I needed power to expose this, and that meant a lot of money.  That's why I joined the expedition. However, it seems he already knew about me."
Rhiard Ashd, a mage from the Rengman School, where the Master of the Magic Tower is the head. 
"Wait a minute! I, I really have nothing to do with this! My life's creed is long and thin!"
As if.  I know you're an evil spirit, and heaven knows it too.
I guess your secret got exposed somehow. 
I quickly skipped over Sven Parab's desperate plea of innocence.
After that, whenever our eyes met, the team members would flinch and confess their personal reasons for being targeted.
"..."
Of course, there were also those who remained silent.
But they only shut their mouths because they didn't want to expose their vulnerabilities.  They too seemed to have some idea what was going on.
As this unexpected confession session continued, someone yelled in indignation.
"Wait a minute! I, I... I have no reason to be discarded by the cult!"
It was a priest named Periton Eriabos, who belonged to the Kaislan team.
"This, this is clearly wrong! I, I only signed up because I thought it was for the good of people..."
It wasn't a voice of lies.
No, it wouldn't be a lie in reality either.
I spoke with genuine sympathy.
"I'm sorry if that's the case. You were just unlucky enough to be caught up in this."
"Wait! Unlucky? You mean—"
"There are others like you, you know."
Erwen and Amelia, for example.
Passible Eric Colson, the knight who had been a Kaislan loyalist for almost ten years. And Rick Jaggerstar, James Karla's childhood friend, are both in the same boat.
Well, they got caught up in this because they chose the wrong friends, so I guess they're less aggrieved than this woman.
"That's...!"
The priest lowered her head, looking genuinely innocent.
No, it wasn't just her.
As expected, the atmosphere of the expedition team was like a funeral.
"Is it really... are we really abandoned?"
"If it came to this, there's no way to deny it..."
"So, even if we come back alive, the Royal Family will try to kill us anyway?"
"Damn it all!!!"
Like a string that had snapped, their eyes began to flicker with anxiety.
"Are we going to die? Really? Like this? Here?"
Some were filled with despair.
"I... I have something I absolutely need to do!"
Some were consumed by rage.
"...There's something logically wrong! Then what about Pike Neldain?"
Some craved even a sliver of hope, voicing their doubts.
"If they were planning to abandon us all, why would they send a spy to sabotage the mission?"
Ah, yes.
I've thought about that too.
There were two possibilities that I could think of.
The first was that the Guildmaster didn't want to cede credit to the Duke.
After all, I'm the expedition leader.
If he wanted to interfere with me becoming the expedition leader and leading to the destruction of the Eye of the Sky, making the majority of the credit go to the Duke, then...?
"It's a very plausible story.  If we had lost all of our food at Ice Rock, we might have all died before even reaching this point."
It was definitely a possibility.
However...
Tap, tap.
It's best if I don't mention this part.
I made my decision.
Worrying about the worst-case scenario is enough for me.
So...
"Why would someone send a spy?"
Only the team leaders know that the spy's mastermind is the Guildmaster.
Let's just say what we need to.
"It's simple."
The words they're all hoping to hear.
"There are people out there, in the city!"
I addressed everyone with a strong voice.
"People who want to see us survive this meaningless waste!  Even if it's just a pipe dream!"
We have to keep moving forward. 
We're still alive.
***
A room where all the windows are closed, not letting in a single ray of light.
That's the current state of our expedition team.
It's partly intentional.
"What changes if we miraculously get away from them? A happy ending, where we return to the city and laugh together? Do you think that's possible?"
When the guy said those words in front of the team, I didn't stop him.
"I'm Bjorn Yandel."
I spoke his name, the one that would be a death sentence for them.
"Is it really... are we really abandoned?"
"If it came to this, there's no way to deny it..."
I took control of the situation, erasing hope from their minds. It was like closing the windows of a room that was already dark, one by one.
My reason for doing this is simple.
Those who dream of a golden future crumble easily.
So...
A sliver of light shining through a slightly open window.
For now, that's enough.
At least it's enough to make them look in one direction and move forward. 
"So, we can survive if we go back...?"
"But... we don't even know who that person is.  Will he really have that kind of power..."
They saw the light.
Even if they doubt whether they're seeing a hallucination.
That much is certain.
Therefore...
"Everyone, listen!"
I have no choice but to try to motivate them.
Let's crawl towards the light, even if it's through darkness.
I don't know if there's a cliff at the end, or what awaits. 
But let's at least check it out.
"I'm Bjorn Yandel!"
I say my name.
Then I ask, "Have you ever heard of it?"
The team members replied.
"How could we not?"
"An explorer who became a nobleman after decades."
"When we heard the news of his death, it was a huge commotion."
Their voices were flat and despondent.
I shouted with renewed energy, "At least you've heard of me!  I'm not going to beat around the bush. Our situation is dire!  We've got some crazy bastards chasing us from behind, and a pack of wolves waiting for us in the city! But...!"
"I've never given up in my life, and this is no exception."
I tell them, "I, Bjorn Yandel, promise you on my warrior's heart."
I can't dare to promise I'll save them all.
"I'll do the hardest part."
"I'll do the dirty work, even if you don't want to."
"I'll be the first to walk into the stench of blood, and if someone has to get hurt, it'll be me."
"So...!"
I politely asked, "Follow me."
My voice was low, but it certainly pierced their ears.
"..."
"..."
But no answer came.
Were they just staring at each other?
They're acting like this, even after I pleaded so earnestly.
Damn it, this makes me so angry.
"If you're going to be thrown into the gutter anyway, why not be thrown by me?!"
You have to yell to get them to listen, don't you?
***
"If any of you understand, get ready. We'll depart in one minute."
I turned my back after saying that.
Immediately, someone followed me.
"Uncle, let's go!"
Erwen Pornaci di Ter시아.
"Good.  If we waited any longer, I was going to leave alone."
Amelia.
My precious comrades who would follow me even into the flames.
"Jun, it seems your words were true after all."
Next came Kaislan.
"Even when everyone else crumbled, that man stood firm. I don't know what awaits at the end, but I'll follow his back."
Kaislan stood behind me.
Then came Akuraba.
"I never intended to give up here from the beginning. We've been in worse situations, haven't we? If I had given up back then, I wouldn't be standing here now."
Jun stood after Akuraba, and once James Karla joined them, the team members started to get up one by one.
"Bjorn Yandel, he's even more stupid than the rumors say."
"Kukuk, I thought he was going to say something cool, but he ended up just yelling."
"We've rested enough, let's go again."
"He said he'd handle the dangerous stuff, didn't he? If you hesitate after hearing that, you can't call yourself an explorer."
"We can't die here, but..."
"Wait! Everyone, don't just stand around haphazardly, let's get into formation! Formation! Okay?"
Before my one minute was up, everyone was behind me.
It wasn't exactly a moving scene.
Even when standing before the brink of death, humans always hesitate.
I probably could have left alone and they would have all followed me.
But...
"Yandel! So when are we leaving?"
"Hey, you... what's with that attitude towards your commander...?"
"Honestly, you worry about the silliest things. We're all going to die anyway if things go wrong."
There's an old saying, "It's all in the wording."
Their lackluster eyes, which had seemed incapable of even slicing an orc, began to glow with life.
Because they were afraid of being left alone.
Because they couldn't stand being abandoned again, after already being discarded once.
It was a transformation I could never have brought out if they were just reluctantly following me.
"Alright, then there's one more thing to take care of before we leave."
"Take care of?"
Sven Parab tilted his head with anxious eyes, and I ignored him completely, heading towards the sleds.
One of the warriors rushed towards me, "Wait! You were pulling it alone until now, weren't you? We should all pull it now..."
As if.
Who said I was pulling it at any point?
"Wait... why are you taking the food boxes off the sleds?"
"I think we can carry this much in our backpacks."
"...Huh? Carry?  Then what about the rest...?"
What else could I do with the rest?
I have to abandon them.
Whoooosh-!
I tossed two sleds, the ones I was barely managing to pull, off the cliff.
The cliff was so deep that it took over ten seconds for a muffled "Kuuung-!" to echo faintly.
"...C, crazy!"
"What are you doing?!"
What am I doing?
Why are those guys moving faster than us?
"We'll be caught by them soon if we're still moving with the sleds."
"Yeah, but... you can't just..."
"What's the problem? The food in our backpacks will be enough until we get out of Eye of the Ice."
"But, but! What are you going to do after that?!"
It was a valid question and concern.
We'll be out of the Eye of the Ice in two days, since we've reduced our luggage, but we still need to survive for another eight days until the Labyrinth closes.
However...
'Damn it, he's so impatient.'
Do you think I just did this without thinking?
Before the anxiety grew, I quickly shared the plan I'd made.
"Monsters come out once we leave the Eye of the Ice, don't they?"
"Monsters...?"
"Wait, you don't mean...!"
I didn't deny their doubts.
"Yeah, from there, we'll use distortion magic to obtain meat."
It seemed like this only increased the anxiety.
"He's serious about this..."
"He's gone crazy."
"There... I... I think it's better to just die here."
It's the best option.
