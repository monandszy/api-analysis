## The Heart of the Dragon Slayer (1)
We stood facing each other in the empty space, a silence settling between us. The dragon man, Lafir, chuckled, his booming laugh echoing through the chamber. 
“Ha! I wondered when you’d show up. It’s been ages! Did you know how surprised I was to hear you were alive?”
This was a greeting I’d heard countless times since my return, so much so that it felt like a scratched record. My reply, as always, was mundane.
“Sorry, I wanted to come sooner, but I’ve been so busy.”
“Seems you’ve been caught up in some troublesome affairs. I know some of the details, so don’t worry too much.”
Oh, is that so? I wondered just how much he actually knew.
As I pondered this, Lafir leaned closer and spoke in a softer voice. 
“In any case, I’m relieved. Our daughter was heartbroken after everyone thought you were dead.  Would it be alright to call her? She’d surely want to see you.”
“After we finish talking.”
“Talking? So it’s not just a social call then?”
“Didn’t Rabien tell you?”
“My eldest only mentioned you wanted to see me and that you should be brought here after the paper was torn.”
The way his eyes lit up with curiosity confirmed it wasn’t a lie. Had she really kept everything from him? My trust in Rabien suddenly spiked.
“If it’s not just a social call, then why have you come here?”
“I need a promise before I tell you.”
“A promise?”
“A promise that you won’t speak of what happens today to anyone.”
Even if that person was the King of this land. At those words, Lafir’s expression hardened as he grasped the severity of the situation. Nonetheless, he agreed to my request with a cool nod.
“I swear it by the soul bound to my name, ‘Pirsearalaidormus’.”
A minimal safeguard, but at least the dragon people considered a promise sworn on their name to be sacred. The name itself was long and difficult to pronounce, and I had no clue what it meant.
“Now, are you going to tell me?”
It would be much faster to show him than to explain.  I retrieved the box I’d kept in my dimensional pocket and revealed its contents.
“This is…”
The moment Lafir saw the heart, its surface rough like a tropical fruit, his eyes narrowed. Being a dragon man himself, he recognized it immediately.
“A dragon heart. Could it be… the heart of the Dragon Slayer, Regal Bagos?”
“Yes, it belongs to the Dragon Slayer.”
“…Indeed. That is…”
Lafir’s face contorted with a mixture of shock and disbelief, his brow furrowing as he trembled slightly. He may have suspected it, but hearing confirmation was a different matter altogether.
Yet, as a leader of his people, he recovered quickly.
“…Frankly, it’s a very perplexing situation, but let me say this first.”
The dragon man bowed his head, looking at me with respect.
“Bjorn, son of Yandel. On behalf of my people, and as a father myself, I express my heartfelt gratitude for your actions.”
I understood immediately. Even if I hadn’t held the title of Baron or Barbarian Chieftain, his demeanor wouldn’t have changed. 
It wasn’t the best time to think about it, but it was a good sign. It meant there was a slightly higher chance of him agreeing to my request later.
“…So how did it happen? I haven’t heard about the Dragon Slayer’s death anywhere. Did you perhaps encounter him this time?”
“No, the Dragon Slayer died at Ice Rock.”
“During the expedition? You mean…”
“What do you know about the expedition?”
“Only what’s public knowledge. Rabien also told me the same.”
“Then we need to start from there.”
I explained everything that happened during the expedition, and Lafir, who had been listening intently, finally grasped the full picture. 
The crux of that expedition boiled down to one thing:
“The Rose Knights… they were killed.”
The Rose Knights were killed. In other words, we had declared open war against the Royal Family.
“Now I understand why you emphasized secrecy from the start.  I see why she couldn’t tell me the truth.”
“Don’t be upset.  Even though I got the heart, I came to see you only now because of this.”
“…I understand. I’m thankful you came to see me, even after everything, but…”
Lafir sighed. 
“Part of me is also afraid.”
As expected from a leader, he was easy to reason with.
“What is it you want from me?”
It was time to get to the point.
