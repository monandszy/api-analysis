## To the Future (5)
The Alminus Central Exchange’s First Auction Hall.  Even during regular auctions, which featured only the finest goods, the hall seldom reached half capacity. Today, however, it was packed to the brim.  And the crowd wasn't filled with mere passersby.
"Look, there's the Clan Master of the Nenma clan."
"He's not here for himself, you know.  He's buying this for that explorer, the one they call 'Iron Wall'.  Didn't the protector of the First Team die recently? This is probably to fill the vacancy."
From explorers whose gear shimmered with polished brilliance, to… 
"Oh, so Ragman’s Trading Company is also after this essence?"
"If the price is right, there's no item a merchant wouldn't buy."
"Hmmm, still, the items offered at auction are usually difficult to resell at a similar value."
"The value of a good isn't limited to its material worth, you see.  Isn't Duke Kudo’s birthday coming up soon?"
"Of course, if someone could use this to get an invite to that gathering, it would give them a chance to impress many noblemen."
There were those who weren’t explorers but clearly exuded wealth.  No one seemed to be here simply to gawk.  Of course, it made sense; the auction had become such a sensation that even the entrance tickets were selling for exorbitant prices.
"Tickets were a nightmare to get."
If not for Amelia, who had alerted us to the auction beforehand, I would have had to settle for a scalped ticket and come in alone.
"Stop glancing around so much," Amelia chastised.  "Drawing attention isn’t going to do you any good."
With the grumbling beginning, I expertly shifted the conversation.
"Have you been to places like this before?"
"Enough times."
Right, she’s been an explorer for much longer than I have.
"Then I’ll just ask you if I have any questions."
I spent the remaining time discreetly observing my surroundings.
"There are surprisingly many of us with masks," Amelia remarked.  "The auction winner’s identity is always anonymous anyway."
"Those who don’t want their participation known are everywhere."
"Oh, look, that guy in the suit.  Who is he?  He doesn’t look like an explorer or a merchant."
"He's a representative sent by a powerful family.  His attire is impeccable, but he’s not from a noble house.  Those families prioritize their lineage's image even in these details."
"Really?"
This girl is an encyclopedia.  She answers every question without hesitation.  Since I wanted to test her knowledge, I continued asking various questions.  Just then, the auction began.
"Amelia… can we not afford that?"
"Not unless you’re willing to give up something else."
"That means we can’t…."
I had been focused on the essence, but there were other impressive items on display.  The first item, and many that followed, were of a high caliber.
"Why is a triple-number item being auctioned at a trade exchange?"
It wasn't just any triple-number item, either.  It might be useless to me, but it was a common item any blade-wielding dealer could use.
"Ugh, if I only had the money, I’d buy that and store it in my vault."
With each new item, I could only watch the heated competition with growing regret.
"140 million stones! 140 million stones! Any higher bids?"
"…"
"The auction is awarded to the anonymous bidder!"
Auctions were a lot more straightforward in this era.  Instead of the incremental bids dictated by the auctioneer based on price ranges, anyone could submit a higher bid at once.  Yet, the bidding method was oddly modern. 
Beep, beep, beeeep.
Each chair had a magical tool on the right armrest where bidders could input numbers.  After entering a bid and pressing enter, the price would appear on the digital board above the stage.  This allowed for complete anonymity.
"This way, at least, they protect everyone’s identity.  Otherwise, it could lead to a brawl."
This method, incidentally, originated at the Sky Auction House.  I learned this while studying history in the library.  Apparently, there had been a dispute between noble families who bid against each other using their real names, leading to a fistfight.
"Now, for the seventeenth item!"
The auctioneer announced, and a vial emerged from a luxurious box atop the stage.  Many essences had been offered before, but this one was different.
"Yandell."
"I know."
Unlike previous essences, a large picture was propped next to the box.  It depicted a monstrous beast, its entire body covered in thick scales, roaring in fury.
"A Vol-Herchan."
"They even prepared this, huh.  They really put a lot of effort into this auction."
The crowd buzzed at the sight of the beast, its dynamic posture almost bringing it to life.
"Oh…."
"I thought this essence would be presented last."
"Yes, it’s rather odd.  There are a total of thirty-five items to be auctioned today, so we’re only halfway through."
Some questioned the presentation of the essence midway through the auction, but I saw nothing out of place.  It was a brilliant marketing tactic.
"Alminus Trading Company knows their stuff."
If the essence appeared at the end, those who had saved their money would have been forced to spend less on the other items.  They’d have fewer chances to bid on the remaining goods.  But if it was offered in the middle of the auction, and its owner was decided early on…? That’s a whole different story.
With the allocated funds now gone, those who needed something from the remaining goods would be free to bid without hesitation.
"This item is the essence of a Vol-Herchan, acquired during this expedition by 'Lightning Spark' of the Maruel Clan, who personally slayed this ferocious beast…."
The auctioneer began his description of the essence and its story, and the mood in the hall changed.
"Ahem…."
Those who had casually chatted and formed acquaintances during the earlier auctions were now eyeing each other with suspicion.  The explorers’ eyes shone with desire, while the merchants' eyes, like wolves sensing an opportunity, glimmered with sharp intensity.  They looked like soldiers on the verge of battle.
And then, in this situation… 
"Tsk, someone’s looking at my prize."
Beep, beep, beeeep, beep.
I pre-entered the amount.  And then…
"Now, the starting bid is 50 million stones."
With the beginning of the auction…
Beep.
I pressed enter.  As if in response, a number appeared on the digital board.
[870,000,000]
870 million stones.  This is why this auction would become famous, enough for Amelia to hear about it later. 
"…"
"…"
It was the only bid.
***
A heavy silence fell upon the hall after my aggressive bid.
"870 million stones! The bid stands at 870 million stones!"
The auctioneer, demonstrating professionalism, tried to maintain a composed voice as the commotion began.
"870 million stones?"
"What kind of madman throws around that kind of money…."
Some gaped in disbelief. 
"Who is this person, to bid such an amount…."
Others wondered about my identity.  While those who had given up on the competition looked on with interest, those who had seriously coveted the essence reacted differently.
"You need to decide quickly, before it’s awarded."
They looked worried and began to hastily discuss.  Their reactions were varied, as well.
"870 million stones is impossible…."
Those who had already exceeded their budget.
"It’s not impossible, but… to buy this essence used by protectors for that price is insane.  We’re giving up."
Those who made decisions based on simple cost-effectiveness.
And then…
"Why shouldn't we bid?"
"Maybe the exchange is pulling some strings."
Those plagued by doubt hesitated.
"By ‘strings,’ do you mean they're using someone to whip up interest?"
"It’s possible… but the exchange could have merely offered the essence as bait. They might not be selling it at all."
Some even suggested the Vol-Herchan essence was a fake, offered to entice bidders.  But none of that mattered.
"…"
"…"
Stunned by my bid and overwhelmed by the commotion, those who were seriously considering bidding contemplated their next move.  Yet, amidst the confusion…
Tick, tock.
Time kept ticking.
"Any further bids…?."
The auctioneer, who usually hammered his gavel with vigor, paused three times longer than usual before finally speaking. 
And…
"…"
"…"
Watching those who were simply looking at each other, he declared the end of the bidding.
Bang! Bang! Bang!
The clear sound of the gavel, signifying the end of the auction, resonated in the hall.  I nodded repeatedly, a satisfied smile playing on my lips.  After all, the best part of any auction is the instant purchase.
***
The auction was a whirlwind, and we immediately went to the delivery room to pay for and receive the Vol-Herchan essence.
"870 million stones... confirmed."
The employee who handed us the item seemed to hold a considerable position within the exchange.  He eyed us suspiciously because of the unusual rumors we had created, yet he couldn't hide his intense curiosity.  Was this professionalism?
"Have a pleasant journey."
He only glanced at us occasionally, not asking our identities or even making any unnecessary remarks.
"Hurry up, will you."
As we left the delivery room, we felt countless eyes on us.  Everyone seemed curious about what we had bought.  However, since they didn’t know which of the thirty-five items we had purchased, no one dared to approach us.
"Anyone following?"
"No one anymore.  They seem to have just been curious and decided to tail us once."
"Really?"
"Where should we go?"
There was only one place.
"The temple."
We left Commelby by carriage and immediately went to the Rea-atlas sect.  It was almost time for them to close to outsiders, but we made it just in time.
"You’re here to erase the traces from your souls."
"Here’s your donation."
"Yes, will your companion wait outside?"
"They will."
I paid the priest the amount I had set aside and had the essence removed.  It was, as planned, the Corpse Golem.
"Come to think of it, I've never erased an essence at the temple before."
I had heard about it from others, but actually erasing an essence for the first time was much stranger than I expected.
"This presentation… in the game, all I had to do was press a few buttons on the keyboard."
A brilliant white light enveloped me and I found myself in a pure white space.  I awoke in this place, naked, and in my hand was a blue dagger the priest had just given me.  All around me were giant beasts, all trapped in thick iron bars.
Ogres, Orc Heroes, Stormgush, Manticore, Bayon.
And, of course, my target for today, the Corpse Golem.
I watched them for a while, then used the dagger to sever the threads of light connecting the Corpse Golem to my body.  And…
Whoosh-!
When I came to, I was back in the temple.
"I feel really strange."
"It's natural.  Your soul is severed from that connection.  Most people experience it initially, so don’t worry.  You’ll get used to the emptiness after a few days."
"Severed…."
It sounded like something a Rea-atlas priest would say, but it made sense.  It wasn’t simply the emptiness from lost stats; the feeling of deflation was tremendous.
"Are you okay?"
"Oh, I’m fine.  I’ll be okay after I eat some meat."
After our business at the temple, Amelia and I returned to the inn.  Then, I took out the vial I had won in the auction.
"Amelia, are you ready?"
"…"
Amelia looked at me, confused.
"I mean, when you ingest this, the shard of record may react, so don’t be surprised."
"Oh…"
I had met the GM, I had stored my equipment in a vault.  Amelia even followed her sister around to ensure she wouldn’t have to worry about taxes in the future.  If my calculations were right, then…
"This is the final puzzle."
I retrieved the shard of record from my dimensional space and ingested the essence. 
"Ugh… this is why I eat essence."
The feeling of fullness, so dense that I hardly noticed the absence of the Corpse Golem.  The light emanating from the vial absorbed into my body, and power surged through me.  Of course, it was much less potent than with the Ogre essence.  Raw strength is rarely found in essences above Rank 2.
"But hey, the important thing is skills."
I slowly opened my eyes, still feeling a bit of afterglow.  I looked at the shard of record, still silent, and sighed.
"Don’t tell me this wasn't it, either."
What else do I have to do?  Am I going to be stuck here for years?  The joy of obtaining a new essence was tainted by my anxieties.
"Well, it’s about time we went back, huh…"
Amelia murmured as if sighing.
"What?"
I tilted my head, and Amelia smiled reassuringly.
"Don’t worry, we’ll be able to go back tomorrow."
Her eyes held a hint of disappointment.
