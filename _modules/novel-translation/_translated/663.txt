## Chapter 663: Traveling Together (2)
"I was a late bloomer in magic," the GM began, his voice smooth and clear. "Twenty years old. It was highly unusual to enter the Magic Tower at such a late age, and naturally, it was incredibly difficult to adapt."
That seemed plausible enough. After all, Raven, an elite who entered the Magic Tower at a young age, disliked these late bloomers. Of course, they disliked non-magic majors like Dwaki even more.
But the important thing wasn’t that...
'Late bloomer?'
It didn’t make sense, no matter how I thought about it. Was he lying to me?
Come to think of it, when we first met, he’d said he was a “Grade 6” magician at the age of one year.
[“...I'm lucky to have a high grade, but I can't even use magic properly yet, so I live in constant fear...”]. 
Because of those words, I assumed it was a problem that arose from the magic being infused into my body.
But it wasn’t?
‘Let's hear him out.’
If it was true, it was a truly unique case.
After interacting with the players in Ghostbusters, I learned that most of those who had grown into magicians after passing through the Door of the Abyss started with magic.
Like our clan's Bersil Goulond.
‘She was already training magic in the Magic Tower long before she turned twenty.’
Then why did the GM decide to become a magician? If he didn’t start as a magician, it would have been easier to become an explorer and eat essences to grow.
“Did you have a specific reason for learning magic at that age?”
When I asked directly, an unexpected answer came.
“Actually, I didn't want to be a magician. I just wanted to be an explorer.”
“Huh?”
“Of course, it was a good fit for my personality to fight monsters within a dangerous dungeon. But as you said, it wasn’t the norm. It’s uncommon for someone to learn magic after turning twenty.”
“...That's true."
“Originally, I wanted to learn archery. I figured I could handle a crossbow, at least."
So, his desired profession was a ranger…
This made me even more curious. How did someone who aspired to be a ranger become a magician?
“I had to make money to even buy a crossbow, being penniless. I did every job imaginable once I became an adult. Once, I even got a job at a blacksmith’s…”
Surprisingly, during those days of hammering iron, the GM’s magician route was unlocked. He met the Master of his first school by fate...
“He was intrigued by a toy I made in my spare time. He asked to talk to me, took me aside, and we chatted for hours.”
The Master was constantly impressed by the precision of the GM’s toy designs and his imagination.
‘Well, that makes sense. He’s a modern person.’
Was it a kind of modern person cheat code?
You know, like in some novels. A guy who was transported to another world, everyone would be amazed by the things he builds.
“So, that’s how you ended up learning magic?”
“Yes. The Mireta School specialized in wind-attribute magic, but my teacher, the Master at that time, was also interested in magic engineering and magic circles, so I was lucky enough to catch his eye."
“...I see.”
When I nodded and maintained a listening posture, the GM continued his story.
“Not to brag, but magic just felt right to me. I improved incredibly fast under my teacher's tutelage. As a result, I unknowingly garnered a lot of animosity.”
The GM’s growth rate was explosive, even within the Magic Tower.
“It was unprecedented in the Magic Tower's long history to have someone enter at the age of twenty and achieve Grade 6 in a year.”
Wow, did he really hit Grade 6 in a year?
Wait, if so, what about the “half-baked magician who couldn’t use magic” I heard about?
Coincidentally, the answer to that question soon came from the GM’s own lips.
“But I was still a half-baked magician.”
“...?”
“Do you know that there are so many different fields among magicians that you can become a high-ranking magician without knowing any offensive magic?”
The GM was a perfect example. Showing exceptional talent in magic engineering and magic circles, he became a Grade 6 magician without even knowing how to use a single fire blast.
And…
“Magicians who knew this fact always picked fights with me, and I was always on edge and had to avoid them. Ah, the Magic Tower was truly wild back then.”
“Yet, my teacher was not happy with me learning other types of magic. He said that I was meant for magic engineering and had no time to waste on such things.”
“After repeated requests, I began to learn other spells one by one, but magic engineering always remained my primary study. During that time, I rarely slept more than two hours a day, it was so exhausting.”
But the GM persevered. He found magic engineering fun, and he felt gratitude for his teacher.
“This might sound strange, but sometimes my teacher felt like my father. I… never had a father.”
The GM, who was thoroughly gaslighted, seemed to be drifting further away from the path of an explorer. Yet, he stubbornly endured his life.
However, ‘enduring’ meant that his limits would eventually be reached.
“Finally, I couldn’t take it anymore and ran away. I gathered my own team and became an explorer, and for the next few years, I didn’t return to the school.”
He simply focused on learning magic useful for exploration, but the GM never stopped studying magic engineering.
And as time went on, the magician named Yurben Habellion gained a certain amount of fame as an explorer.
“That's when the incident happened. You might have heard about it, Lord Baron… my teacher was caught messing with forbidden magic.”
Forbidden magic, taboo amongst magicians.
The fact that the GM’s teacher had dabbled in forbidden magic was discovered, the royal family’s forces stormed in, and his teacher was killed on the spot.
“All the magicians in the school were confined for months while they conducted investigations. I was the one who had researched the most with my teacher, so I was investigated the most.”
Confined to the investigation room, day after day, the GM accidentally discovered what kind of forbidden magic his teacher had researched.
“I was shocked. I couldn’t believe it.”
“...What was it?”
“My teacher was researching magic related to 'soul transfer.'”
It was a magic research project aiming to infuse a person’s soul into an object and turn it into a magical device.
He thought that if a biological being could break free from its limitations and be taught forever, it would lead to extraordinary progress?
‘This is just like AI deep learning!’
As I was thinking that, and feeling amazed, the GM continued.
“The most important factor in this project was 'talent.' My teacher believed the learning speed would be determined by how intelligent the soul to be transferred was, so he selected several candidates.”
It was then that I realized why the GM didn’t want to tell me this story.
“Among the names listed in the project plan the investigator showed me, I was first. It seemed they even ranked them by grade, and the number next to my name was the highest.”
Betrayal by the teacher he had respected like a father.
“After that, well… the entire school disappeared, and I somehow ended up founding my own school. As the school grew, I got busier and busier, so I went on fewer dungeon expeditions.”
I can guess how things went after that.
He would have managed the community, expanded his school, and engaged in secret political communication with the royal family.
With the goal of escaping this miserable world and returning home.
“So, what do you think? About my story.”
The GM then asked me in a tone that seemed somehow relieved, and after a moment of contemplation, I briefly answered.
“It was definitely a boring story.”
“...Ah, is that so?”
An awkward laughter, obvious to anyone.
But if I just empathized and grieved with him, it would only create a strange atmosphere.
I don’t believe it would help the other person either.
“But still, it’s a good thing, isn’t it?”
“Yes?”
“The guy who betrayed you isn’t living happily, laughing, but died miserably.”
The GM’s expression went blank for a moment at those words, then he suddenly burst out laughing.
How much time passed?
“Ah, haha, right. Yes. You could see it that way...”
The GM, who had been laughing out loud, suddenly muttered in a bitter tone.
“...It would be truly amazing if I could think of it that simply.”
Well… it’s true that people’s hearts don’t always go as they wish.
***
The next day, after our sincere conversation with the GM, we woke up early and hurried towards the cave leading to the underground passage.
As the day was drawing to a close, we reached our destination.
The problem was...
“It’s nice to have some time like this again. It felt like I was back in my explorer days. Thank you... no, why are you looking at me like that?”
It’s a common courtesy to say such things after returning to the city.
Suddenly saying something like that feels like something’s going to happen...
“...Stop.”
I immediately stopped moving, instinctively checking my surroundings, feeling uneasy.
“...Why?”
“Quiet.”
The guy gripped his staff, his expression tense as I lowered my voice, sensing something amiss.
‘Why are all magicians so Dwaki-ish?’
That question popped into my head, but it wasn’t important right now, so I focused on checking the cave entrance.
[Came, went.]
[The Great Korean, Lee Baek-ho.]
Lee Baek-ho’s graffiti from our previous pass.
Below it, there was a new inscription that I hadn’t seen before.
[Rafdonia’s king, Mother fucker.]
A sentence used as a meme within Ghostbusters, a sentence that no player with community activity experience could possibly not know.
It’s obvious who wrote it.
Lee Baek-ho, he probably wrote it when he was bored on his way back.
“Th, that’s…!”
“Do you know what these characters mean?”
“...I think they’re the characters used by the evil spirits. Now that I look again, the characters above it seem like they’re also from the same ones.”
The GM, unable to reveal that they were evil spirits, stammered and offered an excuse.
Normally, I would have played dumb, asked a difficult question, and teased him, but I didn’t have the time for that now.
“Anyway, it seems someone was here before us. Let's get out of here.”
“...Yes?”
“There’s no point in running into them. It’s troublesome if the city finds out that I’m outside.”
“...Oh.”
The truth was, I didn’t want to run into those Lee Baek-ho guys, but the GM, who didn’t know the real reason, readily agreed.
So…
Swoosh.
I slowly backed away as soon as the communication ended.
Back the way we came, towards the opposite direction of the cave.
One step, two steps, three steps.
As I quickly retreated and was about to turn around…
“AAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!”
A male scream echoed from inside the cave.
It was far from a scream.
No, if I had to say…
“SHITTTTTTTAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALLLLLL!!!”
It was more like a scream of frustration.
Surprisingly, the scream, echoing back like a reverberation, was approaching quickly...
“Can you hear me? You’re nearby! Can you hear me?!”
A man rushed out of the cave, a speed that was almost impossible to follow with the eyes, and yelled.
‘…Lee Baek-ho?’
As expected, it was Lee Baek-ho.
But the problem here is...
“Just wait till I catch you! Oh? If I catch you, I’ll—.”
Lee Baek-ho, who had come out of the cave, jumped high, gaining momentum as he did.
And.
“...?”
“...?”
He made eye contact with the two of us while in mid-air.
Thud.
Lee Baek-ho’s body, which was about to take flight like a jet, landed limply on the ground.
“...Uh, why is Lord Baron here with this guy.”
Lee Baek-ho’s expression was a mix of shock and confusion.
But that expression didn’t take long to turn demonic.
“Is this… the two of you working together...?”
Working together…?
I made a confused expression, and Lee Baek-ho yelled in a voice full of annoyance.
“Stop pretending! You two broke the return magic circle, didn’t you?!”
What? What’s he talking about?
