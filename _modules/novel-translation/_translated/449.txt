## The Unexpected Visitors 
After concluding my encounter with Ragna and returning home, I was surprised to find unexpected visitors. Two of them, in fact. 
“Oh! Sir, you've come! My friends are waiting for you,” Erwen announced, her voice brimming with youthful exuberance. 
“Friends…?” I tilted my head, puzzled. As I stepped into the living room, two figures rose from the sofa, their faces aglow with welcoming smiles.  
“This, this, this, it can't be! This is truly Bjorn Jandel! You’re actually Bjorn Jandel…!” 
Hikurod Murad, a dwarf with a booming laugh. 
And… 
“…Long time, Bjorn. I heard you were alive, but it still feels surreal,” said Brown Lotmiller, his voice deep and resonant.  
These were familiar faces from my past. 
Well, I had seen Hikurod at the forge before, albeit secretly. It was, to be honest, a slightly shocking encounter. 
“Eying, tsut… you seemed wealthy so I explained it nicely, but what bad luck!” I couldn't believe I was accused of sneaking out after just observing the forge. 
“Bjorn, it’s good to see you. I was planning to visit you first. My apologies for the delay,” I said, offering a genuine apology.
“Ha! This fellow is a real character, apologies indeed? I heard you’ve been incredibly busy lately.”
“How do you know?”
“Well, someone as famous as you, everything you do becomes public knowledge! Even if you were just working at the forge, it would naturally reach my ears.”
“…Is, is that so?” I felt a slight pang of discomfort. He knew everything, from my visits to the bereaved families, to my grand ascent ceremony, and even my recent meeting with the expedition team in Commelby. 
Was there an article about the heroes’ reunion in the newspaper? 
“That’s why we’re only just now visiting. I wanted to come sooner, but Lotmiller wouldn’t allow it. He said we should wait until things calmed down.”
“I see.” I gave Lotmiller a grateful nod, taking a seat on the sofa. Erwen, who had been watching the reunion unfold, scurried to my side.
“What would you like, Sir?” she asked politely.
“Water, please. Cold water.”
“Yes!”
As Erwen headed toward the kitchen, Hikurod leaned closer, lowering his voice. 
“Ah, right! You know how surprised I was? I came home, and not only was the Blood Elf Queen there to greet me, but she even offered me tea with a smile!” 
“…Oh, you two have never met Erwen before?”
Lotmiller nodded, while Hikurod shook his head. 
“Actually, I’ve met her once. After the team disbanded, she came to me, worried and asking about you. She wanted to know if you were alright.”
Ah, I think I remember hearing about that.
“Whew, back then, I couldn’t have imagined this little elf becoming such a renowned explorer. Truly, one cannot predict the future.”
“True.” I had always considered Erwen a promising talent, but even I never imagined her growing this fast. And definitely never expected her to earn such a legendary nickname like 'Blood Elf Queen.'
“Speaking of Jandel,” Lotmiller finally broke the silence. “Have you… met Karlstain?”
Ah, I wondered why this topic hadn’t come up yet.
“Not yet.”
“I see.”
“What about you, have you seen Misha?”
“Only once, after you were declared dead. I went to see her out of concern, but she wouldn’t meet me after that one time. Then she disappeared.”
“Hikurod, what about you?”
“My situation is similar to Lotmiller’s. Tsk, with all the rumors circulating in the city about you, I thought she’d come looking for you. But… I hope nothing bad has happened to her.”
Despite his attempts to phrase it delicately, his concern was clear.
But thankfully, Misha is alright. 
Well, I’m not entirely sure if she's okay, but she's definitely alive. 
“I’m looking for Misha too. I will definitely find her and bring her back. You two don’t have to worry.”
“Well, if you say so, then I guess that’s that. But, you know… is this perhaps because of the Blood Elf Queen? 
“…Why is Erwen suddenly in the conversation?”
“Well, there are rumors, you know. Some say you two are… *ahem*.  What’s the truth, Bjorn?”
Ah, still obsessed with gossip.
“It’s baseless.” 
My firm denial seemed to ease Hikurod's mind. He let out a sigh of relief.
“Is that so? Well, then that’s a relief.”
The statement felt oddly ambiguous.
“…A relief?”
“Ultimately, it's up to you, Bjorn. But Karlstain has been with you for a long time, hasn’t she? And it was what Dwalki wished for, wasn’t it? Honestly, even I thought they were a good— ” 
Hikurod's words were cut short.
Clang!
Hikurod's teacup, which had been resting on the table, shattered into pieces.
And then...
Thud.
Erwen emerged from the kitchen, a smile on her face.
"Oh dear, the cup broke," she said. She had brought the cold water I requested.
***
"Sir, here is your water." 
Erwen placed the cup before me. 
Whoosh-!
The shattered fragments defied gravity, floating in the air. The tea that had stained the carpet was met with the same fate.
"There, now it's clean." 
Erwen, using her magical powers, swiftly cleaned everything before turning away, announcing she’d be in her room. 
“… ” 
Hikurod watched Erwen leave, unable to utter a word despite the disappearance of his teacup from the table. 
He might have a loose tongue, but he wasn’t entirely clueless.
“I told you to be careful, we’re just guests,” Lotmiller chided.
“…Ha, ha, ha, I, I really messed up…,” Hikurod managed a strained smile, his voice laced with unease.  He was still shaken by the incident. Tsk, this dwarf really has a big mouth.
The awkward atmosphere hung heavy, so I decided to change the subject.
"Speaking of which, how have you two been? Hikurod, I haven’t seen you working at the forge lately.”
“Eh? How do you know?”
“I actually went to your forge a while back. You were too small back then, so you didn’t recognize me.”
“Huh! That’s...  you didn’t recognize me? Just because I'm a little shorter?” Hikurod exclaimed, incredulous. But truth doesn't change just because you say it doesn’t.
So I simply told him the truth.
“I was quite surprised.”
“Ah, well business has been good lately—"
“No, I mean I was surprised that you’d chase a customer away, telling them to leave if they weren’t going to buy anything, just because I was there.”
“… ”
"Well, at least business is good. That’s great.”
Hikurod blushed, like someone caught in a embarrassing moment. Then, he let out a helpless laugh.
“Ha, ha, you saw that? I feel so embarrassed...”
“I wasn't trying to criticize. There’s nothing wrong with trying to earn money. It’s just… you've changed.”
“I understand. I left the team to pursue my dreams, but now I'm a merchant. I can see why you think it’s pathetic.”
Oh, I didn’t mean to be so harsh…
But I was curious, so I just listened.
“But Bjorn, I just have a different dream now.  There’s more to life than hammering metal.”
“A dream to make a lot of money?” I asked.
Hikurod chuckled.
“Close enough.  Supporting an orphanage costs a lot.”
“What?”
Hold on.
“…Are you telling me?”
“I can’t afford much yet, but I recently added a second orphanage to the ones I support.”
Whew, this makes me look like a petty person. I sighed inwardly, but there was a part of me that couldn’t help but feel a sense of respect.
“Bjorn, I’m going to make a lot of money. Even if it means resorting to ugly means. My potential is dwindling, but not that of these children.”
“… ”
“I will fulfill the dreams that I couldn’t.”
“… ”
“That’s my new dream.”
Hikurod seems larger than life today.
“… ”
“… ”
Hikurod, after revealing his new dream, looked sheepish, as if embarrassed to have shared such a personal thought. I was speechless, and awkwardly took a sip of water.
Lotmiller was the first to speak.
"I’m just… taking it easy.”
His update was even more surprising than Hikurod’s.
This earnest man, a recluse?
“What about your training school? Didn’t you teach exploration techniques to other explorers?”
“Unfortunately, I’m not cut out for the business world.” 
So, it failed…
I was about to offer words of comfort when Hikurod suddenly stood up.
"Hey, Lotmiller!  You’re the one responsible for the training school— ”
“Stop.”
“…?”
"Stop it, Murad. This isn’t the place for that discussion.”
"But… Jandel is a Baron! If he just says the word—"
“I said stop.”
Lotmiller’s low voice resonated through the room. It was so cold and resolute that even Hikurod swallowed hard.
Honestly, I felt the same way.
‘…What a voice.’
The only time I had seen Lotmiller truly angry was during their team’s final exploration. He was angry with himself, frustrated by his limitations as an explorer. 
Seeing him like this, I was speechless. 
So, this is what they mean when they say a good person's anger is scary? 
‘He’s acting like that because there’s definitely a story behind it… ’
Whew, I should ask Hikurod about it later, just the two of us. 
“… ”
“… ”
The awkward silence returned, as if nothing had happened.
Since this was just a waste of time, I decided to get straight to the point.
“Hikurod.”
“Yes? Ah, um…  tell me! What is it?”
“I have a business proposition for you.”
“A business proposition? You say?”
“Yes.” 
If he hadn't come today, I would have gone looking for him. This was important.
“You know,  it’s making me nervous… tell me.”
"I'm going to expand my clan.”
“So?”
“I want you to be the exclusive supplier for our clan.”
“Oh! That’s a proposal only major workshops receive!”
As expected, Hikurod was visibly excited.
Okay, so it’s time for the next step. 
“Alright, let’s get this contract done.”
“Eh? A contract?  Well, we’re friends so do we really need to—?”
“It’s important to be formal when it comes to official business.”
“Hmm…  I suppose you’re right. But isn’t this a bit too rushed? I’ll need to take a closer look at the contract if we’re going to—?”
“Don’t be silly, what’s there to consider between us? Just put your hand on the seal. It’s just a formality, after all.”
“Hmm…  Alright, then.”
I obtained his agreement and promptly drafted the contract. To make it official, I pressed a magical ink pad onto Hikurod’s hand.  
In other words, I…
“Done.”
 Secured a reliable supplier. 
I wonder what Hikurod’s face will be like when I bring him the Rose Knight's equipment.
***
The day after Hikurod and Lotmiller left. 
I donned my old equipment, the relics I had recently received back from Bear and Einar. 
‘Calling it a relic feels weird.’
Whatever you call it, it was the equipment I used to wear. 
“Character has equipped a large Adamantium battle shield.”
“Total item level increased by +1,750.” 
A shield made of 5th stage metal.
And… 
“Character has equipped a Lythium breastplate.”
“Total item level increased by +270.”
The trusty armor I had bought long ago. Whenever it got broken, I’d repair it. If it was beyond repair, I'd buy another one of the same size.
“Character has equipped an Idium greave.”
“Total item level increased by +400.”
The greave I got in the Doppelganger Forest and have been using ever since.
“Character has equipped the No. 8,667 'Wild Outlaw'.”
“Total item level increased by +315.” 
The belt.
“Character has equipped the No. 8,820 'Ironclad'.”
“Total item level increased by +310.” 
Boots that double physical resistance and magic defense for 3 seconds upon use.
And… 
‘Why did Bear have to take this specifically? It's so weird.’
The special magic underwear I had enchanted with ‘auto-repair,’ ‘shape-shifting,’ ‘acid immunity,’ and later, ‘cleanliness.’ 
The ‘Egg Guard,’ as they call it in technical terms.
‘Actually, with [Unification], it's not really necessary anymore.’
I always wore it, even after it became unnecessary, due to the nature of the item. It wouldn’t be appropriate to sell it. 
‘I already got back the ‘Soul of the Deceased’ and the ‘Fire Jewel’ from Raven, so all I need now is the necklace from Misha.’
It was rather amusing, like collecting Dragon Balls.
Swish.
As I stood there, looking at myself in the mirror, I was glad I had stubbornly refused to sell my equipment. 
It was impeccably maintained.
It’s already a blessing to have it stored away instead of sold, but even the parts that were damaged during the fight against Stormgush are perfectly repaired.
Equipment repair can get pretty expensive. 
‘Misha said she only took one necklace.’ 
Whew, it’s actually the most precious thing I own.
‘Alright, no issues with the condition of the equipment… ’
I inspected my gear one more time and stepped out. 
Even though I’m not wearing my helmet, it’s been ages since I last walked the streets in full gear. 
It’s not like I have to fight a lot in the city.
I usually just wear my chest plate.
In other words, this means I have a fight coming up.
Thump, thump. 
After a long walk, I reached the outskirts of the 7th District. 
The gate, where other districts met, was firmly shut. The guard on the wall stared at me with a challenge in his eyes, like he was demanding a password. 
Whew, can’t he tell by looking?
“Beh-el—laaaaaaaa!” I roared, giving a Barbarian-style shout. Thankfully, I was allowed in without further verification. 
Thump, thump. 
I walked through the same forest path I had walked with my fellow Barbarians after my coming-of-age ceremony.
"Bjorn, son of Jandel! Bjorn, son of Jandel!” 
"The strongest warrior who inherited the name of the Giant!”
Barbarians passing by stopped what they were doing and followed me. The sharp intuition of the Barbarians made them instinctively feel it.
An exciting event was in store. 
“Wa-a-a-a-a-a-a!”
“Bjorn, son of Jandel has returned!”
The forest path ended, and I reached the Barbarian settlement. Well, it was more of a bunch of shacks haphazardly built together. By this time, hundreds of warriors were following me.
And… 
“…The rumors are true.”
The Barbarians living in the settlement had heard about my return. They all came out, barefooted, and were waiting for me.
Thump, thump. 
I continued walking silently, the Barbarians parting for me, pounding their fists against their chests.
Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!
Giants would think it was a festival! 
Boom! Boom!
The path opened before me, leading to the Chieftain’s hut. 
Of course, Einar was standing in front. 
He's been receiving Chieftain training, so he seems to be spending all his time here now.
“…Is the Chieftain inside?”
After exchanging a nod with Einar, I asked. He stepped aside, opening the way to the hut.
He wants me to go in?
Alright, then.
Thump, thump.
When I reached the front of the hut, the curtain was drawn back, revealing a giant Barbarian. 
The Chieftain.
The one who had brutally beheaded ‘Orem, son of Kidua,’ who was exposed as an Evil Spirit, the day I first opened my eyes in this world.
“You’re late, Bjorn, son of Jandel.” 
The Chieftain, carrying a large axe on his shoulder, looked down at me.
“I thought you had completely forgotten us, stuffing yourself with noble treats.”
This guy is truly gigantic. 
Even back to my original height, I still have to look up slightly.
“Forgotten?  That’s impossible.” I replied. 
The Chieftain laughed, as if washing away any lingering resentment.  
Then… 
“Welcome back, warrior of the tribe!”
With open arms, he welcomed me.
“Bjorn, son of Jandel!”
His greetings were finished, and he immediately had a question for me.
But it wasn't the usual kind of question between old friends.
"So…"
He was straight to the point.
“What brings you here today?”
I replied, “I have something to say.”
I’m a Barbarian now, too.
"What is it?"
I stared at the Chieftain, my answer as straightforward as a Barbarian's. 
“Let’s have a good fight.”
“… ”
"For the Chieftain's position." 
The Chieftain's answer was just as immediate.
"Fine."
He accepted my challenge.
And in that instant...
“Be, Beh-el—laaaaaaaa!”
“Beh-el—laaaaaaaaa!”
“Beh-el—laaaaaaaaa—arggghhhhh!”
Every Barbarian began to roar.
