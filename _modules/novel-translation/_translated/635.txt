## Chapter 635: Reconstruction (4)
As if they had been waiting for this moment, I sprang to my feet and voiced my objection, drawing the attention of every clan leader present at the assembly.
"Objection... is that what you said...?"
Lord Mariblack, today's host and chairman of the assembly, trailed off, visibly flustered.
It's understandable. 
After all, I had just been here earlier, bombarded with questions and curiosity about my survival. I answered them vaguely and ended up napping in a corner. 
Now, I suddenly decided to speak up. Why? 
"Why? You said I could object, and I did. Is there a problem with that?"
"No... There isn't. We at Melbes respect the voice of every clan."
"Good!"
With the chairman's permission secured, I wasted no time in stating my opinion.
"Count Goldbeard's clan is not the right choice for this project!"
"Excuse me...?"
Lord Mariblack, along with the other clan leaders, reacted as if they had just heard a bizarre statement. 
Well, it's not exactly out of the ordinary. 
Count Goldbeard, despite being one of only three counts among the thirty-two clans, is a position equivalent to Melbes' co-chairman. 
That alone makes him more than qualified to represent Melbes. Add his ownership of multiple construction companies, and I agree he's the perfect candidate for this project. 
However...
"Then, does Lord Jandel oppose Count Goldbeard's participation in this project?"
"Of course not! We're talking about a chance to make a fortune here, why would I just sit back and watch?"
"Then why object to the current proposal...?"
"Simple! Count Goldbeard is not bad, but I know of a much better candidate!"
"A better candidate... who might that be?"
Lord Mariblack, seemingly genuinely clueless, inquired. I pointed to myself with a bold and shameless thumb.
"It's our very own Lord Jandel's clan!"
"..."
"..."
What's with the silence? 
Shouldn't they ask about my confidence at this point, wanting to know why I believe that?
I had no choice but to self-promote.
It's like a primary school student giving a speech during a class president election.
"If Lord Jandel's clan participates in this project, all the Barbarian warriors will join in. You may not know this, but Barbarians are natural-born workers—more so than dwarves."
I was trying to sell myself, but someone scoffed, interrupting my speech.
"Ha!"
I looked around and saw a dwarf, perched on a chair, stroking his beard.
It was Count Goldbeard, my rival for the contract.
"...Why are you laughing?"
"Oh, sorry. I'm not mocking your Barbarian warriors, but your words are a bit funny."
"So, tell me what's funny."
With a voice as cold as ice, I persistently pressed him, and Count Goldbeard faltered for a moment before chuckling. 
With an air of confidence, he looked at me and said,
"Even outside the construction field."
"..."
"Barbarians wouldn't be better than us dwarves, would they?"
Hah... what a pathetic racist.
My head went blank for a moment, but I suppressed my anger, remembering that I couldn't afford to lose my cool.
"Huh? No better? Just look at our heights. Even the smallest dwarf couldn't hope to compare to a Barbarian's stature."
Their small stature was a dwarf's Achilles' heel. 
They rationalized it, saying they had other talents, but...
The fact that they even tried to rationalize it proves they see their height as a weakness.
"...Ha! If size was everything, why are you the only Barbarian who's become a noble?"
He was laughing, but I could tell his pride was definitely bruised. 
Time to rub salt in the wound.
"Oh, that's curious. You've been living comfortably for so long, so why haven't you grown taller?"
"..."
"Ha! Count, are you different? I still get confused between goblins and dwarves. They're both so short. Ah, but you haven't been to the Labyrinth, so you wouldn't know. How similar goblins are to you dwarves."
"..."
"L, Lord Jandel? Please, calm down—."
"Calm down? Why should I? Look at the Count, his beard's trembling. You know, I've been wondering. Why do dwarves all grow beards? Does it make you taller?"
"..."
The Count, who had been silently trembling his beard all this time, slammed his fist on the table and stood up.
"...I will tolerate no more of your disrespect!"
Of course, even though he stood up, he was still looking up at me.
'Tsk tsk. That's why you dwarves need to have your chairs confiscated.'
While I thought this to myself, I nonchalantly asked the dwarf who had taken a manly stance,
"What if I don't?"
"..."
"What if I don't? Will you challenge me to a duel?"
It was a question that was basically a cheat code. He had only one possible answer.
"...Savage."
He merely sneered at my low character, dodging the question.
But even that was kind of funny.
"Why? Is that why you brought me here? So I can be your shield against other nobles who try to belittle you?"
"Even then... I opposed the idea."
"Huh? It was a unanimous decision during the vote."
"That was settled beforehand—."
"Oh, you can't voice your own opinions when everyone else agrees?"
"..."
"Well, short people do have small livers—."
Just as I was about to throw another barb, someone let out a roar like an enraged bull.
"Lord Jandel—!!"
This was an opponent even I couldn't headbutt, even if I wanted to.
It was my grandfather, the current chairman of Melbes.
His name was Takuo Wellbeart.
He belonged to the Black Bear clan and held the title of Lord.
I hadn't had a proper conversation with him, but whenever we met, he had always greeted me with a kind smile and encouraging words, leaving a favorable impression.
I had also heard from the Rabbit Lord that he was highly respected within Melbes.
I had never seen him angry... until now.
'He's always been quiet and smiling, so he must be really pissed.'
The chairman's roar shook not only me but Count Goldbeard as well.
Then, he thundered at us like a hot-blooded warrior,
"Never! Forget! Why we gather! We must always stand together! Or we will perish!"
Wow, what a voice.
After all, he's a Black Bear, so he's about the same size as me.
"Differences of opinion? Fine! But we won't tolerate internal conflict! Do you understand?"
"...I apologize for my outburst, Chairman."
"Why won't Lord Jandel just answer me!"
"...I will restrain myself."
I took a step back, and the chairman, as if he had never been angry, calmly sat back down with a gentle smile.
So...
"Can I continue where I left off?"
I also responded with a sly smile.
"You mean...?"
"The interruption from that troublemaker stopped me. I was explaining why Lord Jandel's clan is the best choice for this project."
"Ah, yes... You were. Please, continue."
Then, I naturally continued my explanation, as if I had prepared a PowerPoint presentation beforehand.
I explained why the Barbarian clan were the best manual laborers.
I talked about cost-effectiveness and sheer quantity, even mentioning that the 8,712 residents of Bifron could be mobilized as labor.
"Hmm... So, you're saying Barbarian warriors are good at building houses?"
"Of course, not as meticulously and robustly as dwarves. But they're fast."
I added a humble remark, glancing at Count Goldbeard, who coughed awkwardly.
His expression seemed to show he wasn't against the praise, but...
"Ahem, our work pace is never slow either."
I could tell how competitive he was by his insistence on interjecting.
"Anyway, I think the main focus of this reconstruction project is on swift restoration of a vast area. The royal family would also want that."
"That's right."
"That's why I said it. That's why I said Lord Jandel's clan is the best choice for this project."
"Indeed... there's some logic to it... but..."
After my presentation, the response was ambiguous.
Many seemed to be swayed by my argument, but some also seemed to doubt whether my words were true. 
Someone even voiced their doubt.
"But that's just Lord Jandel's word. There's no proof they're so talented at construction work."
"Then why don't we have a contest? We can gather dwarves and Barbarians and have them build something, then judge the result. If I lose, I will gracefully accept the result."
My proposal, which sounded more like something you'd hear in a tavern, flustered the chairman as he looked at Count Goldbeard.
It was a look as if he was asking for his opinion. 
But, as I had already realized from his actions and height, he was just a spoiled brat who wouldn't grow up.
"Fine! Let's have a showdown!"
And so, the duel was set.
***
After the agreement between the two contestants, everyone naturally turned their attention to one person. 
It was the chairman, sitting quietly in the corner. 
Everyone was worried about how he would react to us, who had argued and were now actually going to have a competition.
Everyone was worried, but his reaction was surprisingly cheerful.
"Hahaha! Yes, this is much better! I will have the location prepared and let you know soon. But, whoever wins or loses, I expect you to accept the outcome gracefully."
"I swear on my warrior's honor."
"I swear on my hammer."
Okay, so that's settled...
Since the first issue had taken so much time, Lord Mariblack, who was in charge of the proceedings, resumed the assembly.
"Then, we will conclude the discussion about the project and move on to the next agenda."
For these people, the project wasn't that big of a deal.
After all, it's just about making money, right?
It's us new clans who have to fight for every penny.
These nobles have maintained their positions for hundreds, even thousands of years, so they have enough money to last a lifetime.
And speaking of that...
"The next agenda is an open discussion regarding the recent invasion by the Noirke and the occupation of Bifron."
As soon as the new topic was announced, all the clan leaders stiffened, their expressions hardening, and they sat up straight.
Their attitude was completely different from the casual one they held when discussing the project.
"This discussion is intended for sharing information, analyzing the situation we don't understand, and making inferences. I encourage everyone to participate freely."
As the discussion began, the clan leaders, who had been sitting silently, began to voice their opinions with enthusiasm.
"I have information suggesting that the royal family was aware of the Noirke invasion beforehand. I received this from a highly reliable source..."
"I must warn you, this information may not be accurate. There are rumors that Noirke tampered with the protective magic circle in Bifron."
"Hmm... Those ruffians would dare to touch the Great Sage's legacy..."
The discussion was open-ended, so it went on and on. Naturally, I received countless questions.
"Lord Jandel, do you perhaps know something?"
"Of course! You were closest to the scene when it happened!"
"You're the only one who has been to both Zone 7 and Bifron."
They seemed to be looking forward to my insights, but unfortunately, I didn't know much.
Noirke and the royal family's actions were suspicious, that much was certain.
But it wouldn't be right to bring it up without any evidence.
"I don't know much either."
When I honestly confessed my ignorance, the clan leaders were visibly disappointed.
However, they seemed to understand.
"Hmm, I see..."
"Well, even if he is a Lord, he wouldn't necessarily know anything."
"The royal council will surely discuss this. We can only hope for information from them."
"But in the end, we will only hear trivial stories. The truly important information will never reach us."
"Eventually, they'll monopolize the fruits of this situation."
For some reason, the atmosphere suddenly turned gloomy, and everyone wore a look of resentment.
I could only tilt my head and say,
"Uh... I wouldn't mind telling you more about it in a few days..."
The clan leaders looked just as confused as I was.
"...What? What do you mean, Lord Jandel?"
"Just what I said."
"Haha, just what you said? You're talking as if you're about to be granted permission to attend the royal council!"
"Oh, I am."
Since there was no need to hide it, I simply answered matter-of-factly. But for them, this was no trivial matter.
"..."
"..."
After a brief silence, someone shouted,
"What?!"
"Lord Jandel! Is, is this true?"
"...Goodness gracious! For a Melbes member to be granted permission to attend the royal council!"
Suddenly, the surroundings erupted in chaos.
"This... is this not the first time in six hundred years?"
They haven't experienced anything like this in centuries?
It's honestly outrageous, but...
"Lord Jandel! Lord Jandel! Tell us! How did you obtain this permission?"
"The Labyrinth's Level 1! Is it because of the exploration of Level 1?"
"No, perhaps it's due to the merits you earned by rescuing the explorers in Zone 7."
The intuition of a warrior born a natural gambler was whispering to me.
"Lord Jandel! Tell us—."
"My throat."
"...What?"
"I suddenly feel thirsty. Anything refreshing?"
From now on, I'm the one in control.
