## Chapter 612: Mystery (5)
The river flowed eastward, originating from the temple. 
Beyond its banks, a group of humans had been spotted. 
While it was highly likely they were human-shaped “beasts,” it was still a positive development.
“We attempted contact, but they quickly disappeared. It seems we failed,” the vice-commander reported.
“I see….”
Even though we had little information, any discovery was welcome. 
There had been no progress in our exploration for nearly two weeks.
“Commander, may we have your insights on our next move?”
“Insights, my foot.”
I chuckled and addressed the vice-commander.
“I was already planning to venture across the river. This is perfect timing. Prepare for an expedition.”
“An expedition, you say…?”
“We’ll leave the main force here. Too many people will only create unnecessary complications.”
I had decided it was best to cross the river and investigate the area beyond only after confirming what awaited us.
“Oh, and I’ll be joining this time, so don’t even think about stopping me.”
“Yes… I shall prepare the necessary personnel according to your instructions, Commander.”
We assembled a 36-person detachment, consisting of all scouts known for their speed and keen senses, along with mages, priests, and combat specialists. 
Ainar was included as a combat specialist.
“I think it’s best to leave Fnellin behind,” Amelia, the scout leader, expressed her doubt about Ainar, but I had no choice.
The girl is helpful just by being there. 
With unknown monsters potentially lurking, I needed to boost the chances of obtaining essence drops with the “Beginner’s Luck” buff.
“Vice-commander.”
“Yes. I’ll keep a close eye on the main force, so don’t worry.”
“Then I’ll trust you with it. I’ll be back soon.”
It wasn’t just a courtesy; I genuinely trusted her. 
The vice-commander would manage everything without incident while I was away.
“Scout leader, pick up the pace.”
As soon as the expedition began, we moved with incredible speed, almost like we were speedrunning. 
It had been confirmed that there was no significant danger in this area, but…
If we didn’t hurry, it would take forever to reach the river’s mouth.
“Halt! We’ll set up camp here tonight, and resume our journey tomorrow morning!”
We adopted a strategy of traveling all day and setting up camp at night, allowing everyone to rest.
“You’ve worked hard today, Baron!”
“For goodness sake! It’s Commander, not Baron! Don’t you know you look so bright every time you call me that?”
“Oh, my apologies, Commander! I’ll go rest now. I’m exhausted!”
Despite the long journey, I was now familiar with everyone's faces, but there was still an unfamiliar feel. 
The only Clan Anabada members joining this expedition were Misha, Amelia, and Ainar.
“Bjorn, I have a question… is it okay to ask?”
As I patrolled the camp, the secretary approached me, holding out some snacks. 
“Go ahead.”
“Why did you leave that child behind?”
“Are you referring to Erwen?”
“Yes.”
Misha, the secretary, nodded and replied in a small voice.
“She seems like someone we should bring, given her abilities and everything else. So, it felt a little strange.”
She wasn’t wrong, actually.
Erwen, with her keen senses suited for exploration and top-tier combat abilities, was a perfect fit for this mission. 
But…
“She refused to come.”
What could I do when she chose to stay with the main force?
I did find it unusual, but I assumed she needed a break after all the difficulties she’d faced recently.
“Oh… I see.”
Misha, taken aback by my response, didn’t ask further. 
She simply left.
“Well, I’ll see you tomorrow.”
“Yes, rest well.”
After Misha left, I finished my snacks while reflecting on the situation. 
A sound caught my attention.
I noticed Amelia was speaking with some scouts in a secluded area. 
I couldn’t hear the details, but…
“Yes, Captain. We will remember!”
The last words, spoken with a salute, reached my ears.
“When did she gain such control over her troops?”
She was a woman of remarkable talent.
She might seem clumsy, but she always got the job done. 
“Are you finished? It sounded like you were scolding them.”
“Scolding? I was merely reminding them to maintain formation during our travel today.”
“Oh, really?”
We considered it scolding, but since there was no point in arguing, we simply let it go. 
“By the way, are you going to keep wearing that eyepatch from now on?”
I asked, seeing her remove the eyepatch with one hand and throw it away.
Amelia flinched and replied.
“…Only during exploration.”
“Really? Wouldn’t it be better to wear it all the time to get used to it?”
The [One-Eyed] effect, which increases kinetic vision, doesn’t consume any resources, so there’s no need to keep putting it on and off.
No, it’s actually more beneficial to activate it all the time to reduce sensory errors.
“......”
“I noticed you only wear it during combat, and otherwise you’re always without it. Any reason for that?”
It was a question born from genuine curiosity.
Amelia let out a heavy sigh, her voice tinged with bitterness as she trailed off.
“It’s just... doesn’t it seem strange? A woman like me wearing an eyepatch…”
It was an unexpected and surprising answer.
On the other hand, it was typical Amelia. 
If you look at her closely, you’ll see that she’s quite shy. She might seem dull, but she does seem to care about how others perceive her.
Amelia quickly changed the subject.
“…But why didn’t you bring that child?”
“Oh, you mean Erwen?”
Amelia tilted her head at my words.
“No, I meant that one. The… cute one…”
Ah, she meant Hamsik.
***
After three days of travel, we finally arrived at the river’s mouth. 
However, upon seeing it firsthand, I questioned if it was even accurate to call it a river.
“It’s really as black as they say… ”
It felt like looking at the Taean sea, which was covered in spilled oil. 
It looked dangerous to even touch, let alone drink.
“It’s about the width of the Han River…”
We’d discovered this river a long time ago.
However, the reason we hadn’t ventured into its depths was simple. 
“They said the depth is insane.”
Its depth was disproportionate to its width, making it take a long time to confirm that there was nothing below. 
It seems they even investigated the black water.
“It’s supposedly safe to touch, but be careful just in case.”
We cautiously launched the small boats we had prepared onto the river.
Apparently, boats originally couldn’t float and sank, but thanks to the mages’ intervention, they were able to float just fine.
How long had it been?
“Thank goodness, nothing happened.”
No accidents occurred during our crossing. 
However, the trouble began after we crossed the river.
Whumph-!
As soon as we stepped onto the ground, a heavy vibration spread from within the bushes. 
A sound that top explorers could recognize instantly: the footsteps of a “large beast.”
“Prepare for battle.”
We prepare for combat, ensuring a way back by returning to the boat just in case.
Whumph-!
The distinctive sound grew louder, and finally, the beast revealed itself from the bushes.
Whumph-!
Slightly larger than an ogre. 
A shiny, iron-plated skin and numerous tubes surrounding its neck, unlike ordinary crustacean monsters.
And…
Flash-!
Red eyes, reminiscent of infrared light.
“…It’s a Mechanical Giant.”
“It’s a Grade 3 monster that appears in the Pantelion Ruins.”
Thank goodness it wasn’t a new monster.
Well, it’s such a rare monster that I even first encountered it on the Library Island.
“If it’s just one, it shouldn’t be too difficult…”
But I decided to be cautious just in case. 
This one, which appeared here, might have unique abilities. 
Or perhaps other enemies could appear.
“Expand your vision and stay vigilant!”
Therefore, rather than throwing our entire force into battle, we cautiously continued fighting while being prepared for any unforeseen situation.
It was a “Mechanical Giant,” a top-tier Grade 3 monster, but there was nothing difficult about it. 
I had become incredibly strong after entering the first floor.
“Behel—Raaaaaaaaaaa!!”
Aegis Barrier.
Even its greatest weakness, resistance, had been improved thanks to the Belarios Essence.
“The Mechanical Giant has cast [Magic Beam].”
“The Mechanical Giant has cast [Request Support].”
“The Mechanical Giant has cast [Nuclear Reactor]….”
No matter what the monster did, I blocked and held it without any trouble, while the scouts stayed vigilant, protecting the dealers from their position. 
Thanks to this, the dealers could unleash their power without worry, and slowly but surely, the fight ended.
“Mechanical Giant eliminated.”
The Mechanical Giant, sparking and in a state of disarray, faded into light.
And…
“Essence…! ”
An essence dropped.
“Wow, I used Beginner’s Luck last time and it didn’t drop.”
It was a valuable Grade 3 essence, but my emotional response was less than expected. 
After all, how many Grade 3 essences had I obtained just on the first floor?
I couldn’t even remember what season this was. 
With this quantity entering the market, the price of Grade 3 essences would surely fall drastically.
It was only because of the aftereffects of the last Dimensional Collapse that Grade 3 essences were so expensive.
“Store the essence in a vial.”
As soon as I gave the order, Raven, one of the members of this expedition, approached and collected the essence.
It wasn’t as exciting as getting the Aegis Barrier, but it was still a bit amazing.
“It’s so rare that you’d have to grind for it, and I got it here… ”
The Mechanical Giant essence is quite a good one.
Aside from the base stats and active skills, the passive skill [Mechanization] is pretty good, if you ask me.
With this, you can consume a spirit stone to recover MP. The recovery efficiency is terrible and it consumes money like water, but…
“It’s still got a high ceiling.”
As long as you have enough money, it’s basically infinite MP.
“Speaking of which, where is that group of humans?”
“I think we need to search properly.”
After the battle, we started creating a map while expanding our exploration area. 
However, finding the group of humans the scouts had seen that day wasn’t easy.
“They must have seen something…”
“I haven’t seen any monsters other than that Mechanical Giant since then…”
Please, anything is fine, just appear—.
“Bjorn, come over here! The scouts found some footprints!”
“What?”
I immediately headed towards the edge of our formation, where the scouts were stationed, upon hearing Raven’s words.
“Ah, you came.”
Amelia looked at me, her back bent as she examined the ground.
“So, where are the footprints?”
“Here.”
When I checked, there were clearly visible human footprints on the ground. 
“It’s one person, not a group.”
“Where are they heading?”
“You’ll find out if you follow them. The tracks are still fresh.”
“Then let’s follow them.”
Amelia took the lead, following the footprints, and we guarded our surroundings as we trailed behind.
And…
“They’ve stopped.”
The footprints, which had continued for hundreds of meters, abruptly ended in the middle of a clearing.
“Did they notice us and erase their tracks?”
Amelia didn’t answer. 
She simply scanned the area with focused eyes, before mumbling with a cold gaze.
“…It was a lure.”
Damn it.
“Are we surrounded?”
“Highly likely.”
Even Amelia, who can be considered an expert in this field, didn’t seem completely sure. 
However, the answer to our question came soon enough.
“We really are surrounded.”
“…Prepare for battle!!”
As soon as we established our formation, human-shaped figures appeared from the woods, naked.
I let out a long sigh upon seeing them.
“They’re humans, they said… ”
They weren’t humans.
Some of them had pointed ears, others were short and squat, and some had animal ears growing from their heads.
