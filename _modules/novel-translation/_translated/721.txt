## Chapter 721: Audience (4)
The time spent conversing with the Dawn King wasn’t long, yet a sense of familiarity persisted.  I pondered the reason, the answer quickly presenting itself.
‘He speaks like Baekho.’
Although difficult to articulate, their mannerisms were strikingly similar.  Not merely in their flippant, disrespectful tone, but in that particular glint in their eyes, a gaze that seemed to disregard others as mere objects.  Perhaps those with clear ‘goals’ often bore such a look.  As did I now, looking at the Dawn King.
“Do you consider that insolent gaze a response?”
His words forced me to lower my head and cast my eyes down.  The truth, forever etched in my heart, whispered that to avoid being taken, one must fight back. Yet, regrettably, I couldn’t act as boldly as I had against Baekho.  For I didn’t know this bastard's ‘purpose.’  A power struggle requires understanding each other’s strengths, their cards in the game. 
“So… what do you want from me?”
It was time to listen.  To glean any hint of this creature’s ‘purpose’ and the weapons in his arsenal.
“Boring.”
Had he anticipated my rebellious defiance?  Upon witnessing my retreat, my tail tucked between my legs, the figure beyond the silk curtain tapped the throne lightly.
“Well, fine. I don’t dislike a clever fellow.”
His words, though, were a constant source of discomfort.  This wasn’t the voice of a king ruling a nation, but a back-alley thug.  Although, admittedly, that wasn’t the pressing concern at this moment.
“So, what needs to be done? Am I simply to not open the ‘Gate of the Abyss’?”
I asked, nonchalantly tossing the question into the air.  I had some idea of the ‘king’s’ goal, after all.  It was a subtle probe, a test of the waters.
“What?  Hahaha!  Hahahahahaha!”
This was unexpected.  I hadn’t envisioned a guffaw in my face.
“…….”
My glare met his through the silk, only to be met by an insincere apology.
“Oh, sorry, sorry. You’re so clueless, yet you talk as if you know everything.  But then again, you've always been like this, haven’t you?”
“…….”
“Since you knew nothing, you likely moved forward, rolling your eyes, always striving to survive.  You might have made mistakes, losing something along the way.  And then, unknowingly, an obsession with the unknown took root.”
There was a degree of truth in his words, though his smugness was irritating.  Ah, perhaps this Dawn King had felt the same way?  Hmm, his laughter didn't quite suggest annoyance. 
‘Enough, get to the point.’
I longed to utter these words, to finally move past the incessant ramblings, but I managed to hold back.  This fellow was clearly fond of his own voice.  Or perhaps he was unusually energetic today.  Regardless, I didn’t want to interrupt and stir him. 
“Bjorn Jandel. You know nothing.  You don't understand how this world survives, and you don’t realize the sacrifices I’ve made for it.”
I simply listened, mentally crafting a character information panel for the Dawn King, one stat at a time.
‘Okay, Need for Recognition +7.’
Initially, I'd given him a +6, but factoring in his audacity in speaking to a complete stranger like this, I bumped it to a +7.  And then…….
“Sacrifice?  What exactly does that entail?”
I offered a nod of agreement, subtly emphasizing my engagement in the conversation.  Honestly, I was burning with curiosity, but the creature cut me short. 
“Even the most delicious food has parts we cannot eat.”
I see, a taste for mystery, then.  I refrained from further inquiries, silently adding a stat to his character panel.
[Dawn King]
Need for Recognition +7, Mid-Life Crisis +4
Hmm, I sense a whiff of ‘Shitty Essence’ already, but it’s probably just my imagination.  The essence of a final boss couldn’t possibly taste like crap, could it? 
“……You have an unsettling gaze for some reason.”
His voice suddenly dropped, a noticeable change in tone. 
‘Well, I guess I have to add +3 to his Perception stat then…….’ 
“I wasn’t thinking anything!”
I swiftly addressed his suspicion, though my thoughts were already racing.  What would happen if he ever discovered my information panel?
‘…….Execution, most likely.’
It’s a given, undoubtedly, execution.  Those suffering from ‘Cool Disease’ are notoriously sensitive about such things.
[Dawn King]
Need for Recognition +7, Mid-Life Crisis +4, Cool Disease +4
Okay, so three stats checked already…….
“Whatever…  It’s understandable. From your perspective, I’m the mastermind behind everything.”
“…….Meaning I’m not?”
“A pointless question. Would you believe me if I said no?”
His words carried an air of self-importance.  I responded, relying on the stats I had gathered.
“I wouldn’t believe you right away.  But… if you truly were sacrificing yourself for this world…,”
“…then?”
“Then… I think that’s amazing.”
“…….”
“Before even considering the rightness or wrongness of your methods, it’s not something everyone can do.”
A heart-stopping line, designed to trigger his +7 Need for Recognition.  His reaction came after a brief pause.
“……Tsk, it wasn’t done for someone’s approval.”
The prick, he’s clearly pleased.
‘Should I have given him a +8 instead……?’
While I pondered this, the Dawn King spoke.
“We’ve strayed from the topic.”
He seemed to realize the conversation had taken a detour.
“One can lead a horse to water, but one can’t make it drink.”
“…….”
“Bjorn, son of Jandel. I have a proposition for you.”
Why does he keep making me wait?  Why not just keep talking?
“I’ll hear your proposition.”
As I responded, the figure behind the silk curtain moved, revealing an open palm.
“Five times.”
“…….”
“Just five times, you’ll grant my ‘requests’, and I won’t interfere with whatever you do.”
Huh…
‘Five times…….’
Well, it’s certainly more appealing than becoming a slave forever…
Thump!
It was a poisoned chalice, plain and simple.
***
The carefully rolled dice traverse the board. 
No, literally.
Clatter-clatter-clatter-
The two dice settle, their combined total: 12.
The Dawn King, behind the silk curtain, doesn’t display a hint of excitement.  He simply utters, as if predicting the roll.
“Doubles.”
“……Again?”
Is this rigged?
“Move your piece.”
“Yes.”
Urged on by the Dawn King, the knight seated across from me cautiously moves his piece.
“This brings me back to my territory.  I’ll build a hotel.  And since it’s doubles, my turn again.”
The Dawn King then tossed the dice retrieved by the knight onto the board, rolling a 7, landing in Seoul.
My birthplace, my hometown, the Seoul bursting with hotels.
“Let’s see, the toll is…….”
“I’ll use my discount card.”
“Ah…….”
This bastard is truly playing like a cheat.
‘He gets a discount card here?’
Unbidden, a sense of injustice washes over me, followed by a wave of introspection.
‘What am I doing……?’
It’s not that I truly don’t understand.  I’m currently playing a board game with the Dawn King.  Because the only other option was to drink from the poisoned chalice.
[Just five times, you’ll grant my ‘requests’, and I won’t interfere with whatever you do.]
On that day, the Dawn King made me this proposition, and I accepted.  After all, he wouldn’t make all five requests at once.  I could pretend to grant his requests, then strike back later.  Yet, unfortunately, the Dawn King immediately launched into his first ‘request’ right after finishing.
[Then, for a week, stay here and keep me company.]
The first day was genuinely about companionship.  The Dawn King showed great interest in my tales of exploring other worlds, and I recounted them, omitting certain details, while keeping him entertained.
But perhaps he grew bored quickly.  He dismissed the stories as uninteresting and retrieved a board game from somewhere.  Judging by its appearance, it seemed to be a modern artifact fabricated by torturing the evil spirits brought here…
“Even this is getting old now. Bring that over.”
“Is there a specific book you’d like, sir?”
“I don’t know what my guests like, so bring them all.”
On the third day, the Dawn King put away the board games and brought out ‘manga.’  Clearly, this was another modern artifact crafted by exploiting modern humans.  Judging by the sheer number—over a hundred—it was clear how much blood had been drained to create them.
‘But the content is slightly off.’
There were some manga I’d never seen before, but I also recognized some.  The latter, however, had clumsy art and the story felt like a cheap ripoff based on the original setting.  The captive manga artist had likely simply copied famous works.
It was disheartening, but bearable.
The issue arose when I discovered ‘that’ among the hundreds of manga volumes.
“This art style…,”
It was so familiar.  It was an art style that I couldn't fathom being a mere copy.  Even the title and story perfectly matched the manga I knew.
“Oh?  You recognize it?  From what I heard from other evil spirits, this was apparently a very famous manga.”
“This is insane……!!!”
I couldn’t contain my rage this time.
“Who drew this! What happened to the artist who drew this?”
My anger bubbled from my core as I questioned him, but the Dawn King, unconcerned, simply picked his nose and answered.
“The man who the protagonist considered his brother raped the woman the protagonist loved, and he tore the artist apart right there.”
Ah, that part…
Honestly, I’m not denying I’m angry…
Ha, what drove that artist to participate in this game. 
‘I doubt I’ll ever see the ending, even if I return to Earth.’
Anyway, that third day was spent watching manga, killing time.  Whenever my stomach grumbled, I’d order food from the knights.
“I’m getting a little hungry.”
“I will prepare the table.”
“Two bowls of cold noodles, one deep-fried sweet and sour pork, and some Bamboo Leaf Green liquor.”
“Yes, sir.”
I don’t know for sure, but perhaps this is how martial arts fans feel when a chef serves carbonara or a monk performs a jump in a wuxia story.
‘Bamboo Leaf Green liquor in fantasy…?’
Ha, the [Dungeon and Stone] I knew wasn’t like this. 
Well, whatever.
I’ve already taken the elevator, played board games. I don’t want to stress over this anymore.  It’s not something I should be worrying about right now.
“Playing games and laughing all day has tired me out.  See you tomorrow.”
As the third day ended, the Dawn King vanished into sleep, leaving me alone in the room.
Day one: storytelling.
Day two: board games.
Day three: manga.
The Dawn King’s actions seemed completely random, but deciphering his intentions wasn’t particularly difficult. 
‘…It’s about time, isn’t it?’
Companionship was a mere pretense.  The Dawn King’s true goal was undoubtedly to keep me here, stalling for time.  The key point was this: why was he stalling?
I discovered the answer the next day.
“Well, already day four.”
The Dawn King spoke as we ate breakfast—muffins with bacon, eggs, and tomatoes.
“I’m bored. Let’s watch TV today.”
As soon as he finished speaking, the knights swarmed in and set up a massive screen on one of the walls.
Beep-!
The Dawn King pressed a button on the remote, and the screen flickered to life, displaying the video.
Kaboom!
A crumbling city, with rivers of blood.  Countless people clashing, wielding swords, firing arrows, casting spells.
[Aaaaaaaaagh-!]
[S-save me…….]
Screams filled the air amid the chaos.
[Snap out of it, Goolund!  We’ll all die if we just sit here!!]
My comrades appeared.
