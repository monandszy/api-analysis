## Escape Plan (1)
It had been a long time since a fellow member had leveled up. This event was highly positive for me, especially since Erwen had been on a rampage after consuming the Chaos Essence. 
Well, I wouldn’t know for sure until I had a proper investigation of the essence.  I was about to approach Ainar and inquire about the changes.
“Yandell.”
“…Yeah?”
I turned around, feeling a chill, and saw Amelia, her eyes cold and piercing. 
“I’d like to talk about what happened earlier.”
“Ah…”
Here it comes.
I thought she’d let it go since she’d been quiet all this time. Was she waiting for the right moment because of the Essence appearing?
“Ah! You mean about earlier!”
I laughed heartily, approaching Amelia and praising her for her contribution to the battle.
“Catching that giant was all thanks to you and Misha. If it wasn’t for the two of you, he would have healed himself, and we would have failed the hunt! You worked hard! Ainar! You should also thank them!”
“Th, thanks!”
Despite our sincere gratitude, Amelia remained unmoved. 
“Indeed… so that’s how it’s going to be.”
She’s figured out all my plans.
This is a bit of a problem.
As I was searching for a way out, her gaze, though seemingly unchanged, felt even colder. 
“Kalstain, why are you just standing there?”
Is she trying to corner me further by bringing in reinforcements?
However, it turned out to be a misstep. 
“…Eh?”
“Speak up! Say it if you don’t like it. If you don’t, you’ll only end up suffering—.”
“Huh? I don’t mind it…?”
“……What?”
Amelia was taken aback by her nonchalant response. 
“What… do you mean?”
Her question conveyed genuine confusion.
Misha, sensing this, looked at Amelia, then glanced at me before opening her mouth softly.
“I… think… I’ve finally been helpful… I… didn’t feel bad about it… at all.”
It wasn’t a mere excuse.
It seemed like she was simply stating the truth.
“Kalstain, you…”
“…Yes?”
“…Nevermind.”
Amelia clamped her mouth shut, her face seeming to have a lot more to say.  She sighed, looked at me and said, “I’ll just watch for now, Yandell.” 
Looks like she lost her steam after hearing Misha’s response…
Okay, that’s the end of that.
“Ainar, do you feel any changes?”
“Um… I’m not sure yet! I feel stronger, though.”
We left the remaining personnel on standby and began investigating the newly obtained Essence. 
First, we’d check the active skill.
“Get down on all fours.”
Ainar obeyed without a word, assuming a pose identical to the one I saw during the Hipramagiant battle. 
“Now, try using your ability.”
No need for long explanations.
“Ainar Prnellin has activated [Crouch].”
Ainar, who had already consumed and used several Essences, was proficient in activating her new skill.
Whoooosh-!
A translucent yellow shield, as if protecting the user, rose from above while she remained in a crouching position.
“All resistances increase by 20 times for 3 minutes.”
“Natural regeneration increases by 20 times for 3 minutes.”
“All stats increase significantly for the rest of the battle, proportionally to the damage received while crouching.”
Several experiments conducted while [Crouch] was active revealed that the skill itself was identical to the Ogre’s.
I wondered if there might be any difference in the skill itself.
‘The resistance and regeneration increase values seem similar.’
The part where stats increase proportionally to damage received while in [Crouch] doesn't apply to humans, which aligns with the game.
It’s probably only effective against monsters, just like in the game.
“May… we assist you?”
The three explorers, who were members of the exploration team, approached me as we were about to check the stats. 
“We… brought Essence experiment kits when we entered the maze this time… So we can help you quite a bit, even if it’s not as comprehensive as a laboratory.”
“Oh, in that case, please do.”
It was much better than simply guessing, “You’re stronger now, aren’t you?” So I readily entrusted Ainar to the three mages. 
And how long had it been?
I couldn’t know the exact stats, and the kits couldn’t measure some of the special stats.
But the basic stats information was available.
Strength (High), Natural Regeneration (High), Physical Resistance (High).
Magic Resistance (Medium), Bone Density (Medium), Lung Capacity (Medium).
Vision (Low), Patience (Low), Mana Sensitivity (Low).
And…
“There is one weakened stat.”
Just one minus stat.
“A weakened stat? What is it? Tell me quickly.”
At my urging, one of the mages glanced at Ainar before replying. 
“It's Fighting Spirit.”
It was a stat I hadn't expected at all.
But…
“Fighting Spirit…”
Come to think of it, Ainar has been surprisingly calm.
If it were her usual self, she would have asked to stop these boring experiments and go hunt down monsters.
“Just how… much is it weakened?”
I asked for specific details, but the mage only replied that it was difficult to measure with their current equipment.
So I decided to use a primitive method.
“Ainar! I’m bored, how about a sparring session?”
A Barbarian never refuses a sparring session.
It’s basically just playing, after all.
You can see the warriors fighting from morning till night on the training grounds at the Barbarian dormitory.
But what’s this?
“Sparring…? Um…”
Ainar, a High-level Barbarian, trailed off, hesitant.
“…Let’s do it later! Later! Isn’t it time to research first?”
She refused?
‘No wonder that giant kept running away…’
Just how much has her Fighting Spirit been reduced?
***
The explorer you see today is not the same person you saw yesterday.
This is a common saying used to describe the ruthless nature of explorers, but it’s actually a true statement.
Consuming Essences is necessary to explore the monster-infested maze, and it’s common for Essences to affect the explorer’s personality, just like with Ainar right now. 
“Fighting? Sure, I'll do it, but… do we really have to go out of our way? Things are peaceful and nice now…”
The Barbarian warrior, who a few minutes ago was looking forward to slaying monsters and proving her prowess, had completely changed in an instant. 
“Battle Cry.”
“…Yeah?”
“Perform Battle Cry.”
“Behel… Laa…?”
“Damn it.”
This isn’t something to laugh about. This is serious.
While she has never been free from problems, Ainar’s biggest advantage was her aggression.
“Yandell… is this alright?”
“…Prnellin’s acting so weird it’s scary.”
The other members, having heard the lackluster Battle Cry, also realized the severity of the situation and cautiously approached me.
The close combat fighter who should be at the front line is acting like this. They’re worried.
But there’s nothing I can do right now.
The next Essence I’m going to feed her has a lot of Fighting Spirit attached to it, so things might be okay after that…
‘Until then, will she remain like this?’
I’m seriously curious.
Just how much has her Fighting Spirit been reduced? 
Her base personality is aggressive, so even a reduction of a few dozen wouldn’t cause this…
‘It must be at least -100.’
I’m a bit worried too, to be honest.
It’s a good thing that it’s not Strength or Resistance but a non-combat stat like Fighting Spirit that’s been reduced, but still. It can’t be too low.
‘…Would I become like this if I ate it too?’
And since I’m eating this Essence after the Fighting Spirit 40 from the Orc Hero has already been removed, the change will be even more drastic.
“What about the Embodied Ability? Is there no way to find out?”
We’ll start by figuring out what the passive ability is. 
“In the case of Embodied Abilities, we can’t figure it out with the tools we have. However, we can figure out what kind of ability it is.”
“Go ahead.”
With my permission, the mages approached Ainar with various experimental tools, and returned with the results after about 30 minutes.
“The Embodied Ability seems to be a Support/Auxiliary type. The stat changes are biggest in that area.”
“It’s not a Survival or Defense type?”
“The signal is being picked up there too, but it’s negligible.”
It was completely different from what I had expected.
After seeing her survive a head wound, I thought that’s what it would be.
[Last Stand], [Phoenix Heart], [Last Chance]…
I was thinking along those lines, but I never expected it to be something else.
‘What is it then?’
Since I couldn’t tell, I proceeded with the tests I could do immediately. 
“Ainar, it’ll sting a bit.”
“I hate it when things hurt…”
“That’s because something’s wrong with your head right now.”
“Oh, is that so?”
As a test, I cut off about an inch of her finger, but we didn’t get any meaningful data.
This was the same with the sparring session we did after I convinced her, who was reluctant to spar.
“…That’s enough sparring.”
“Oh, really?”
I decided to investigate the passive ability later when we had more time. It had already taken quite a while just to get this far. 
“Come on, let’s go.”
And so, the exploration resumed.
***
We spent about three days on this island, searching it thoroughly without wasting a single moment.
Our priority was to complete the island’s map. 
We naturally encountered numerous monsters during this process, including Hipramagiants.
I think we encountered those guys about eight times.
We skipped three encounters because there were two of them at a time, and we failed two times because they managed to escape.
We successfully raided them three more times.
However, this time, we didn’t get even a single Stone from any of them. 
It was all because Distortion Magic failed every time.
‘Distortion Magic has to succeed, and then you have to get through the chance of the Essence appearing…’
I hadn’t considered it before, but I realized just how lucky we were to have obtained an Essence on our first attempt.
The entities that disappeared with their bodies were ridiculously difficult to obtain Essences from.
‘It’s fine if the Essence drops due to “Beginner’s Luck”, but if Distortion Magic doesn’t even succeed… It probably wouldn’t even have worked.’
Regardless, we learned more about Hipramagiants through repeated battles with them.
‘The Village Chief’s book said they were estimated to be Tier 2…’
But no matter how I look at it, they’re not Tier 2.
Their Stone size is almost the same as the top-tier Tier 3s.
Well, since they have [Crouch], the minimum damage required to defeat them is high.
They have high survivability, but their attack power is relatively low.
That needs to be considered before assessing the tier.
‘So… if you consider that they live in packs, maybe 2.7?
That’s about right, I think.
It’s strange for them to be classified as Tier 2 when they don’t even have a single Tier 2 skill.
The authenticity of the information in the Village Chief’s book came into question, but I decided to treat this as a special case.
He even wrote in the book that he didn’t witness it himself, but only heard it from someone else.
“We’re finally… leaving this island.”
As I was organizing my thoughts while watching the island disappear in the distance, White Hecks approached me.
“You look relieved. You haven’t even figured out how to get back to the city yet.”
“Still, it’s much better than being stuck on that island. I didn’t know what would happen back then.”
That’s still true, but I didn’t say anything.
Even at the bottom, there are levels.
The current situation is much better, since we have something to believe in…
——————————!
At that moment, a gust of wind blew from the island, causing the ship to shake violently.
‘What?’
I was about to call for Erwen, who was on the observation deck, but White Hecks pointed to a spot with his finger. 
“Th, there…! There…!”
There? What’s there?
I looked in that direction, puzzled as to what was wrong. Then my body froze. Not just mine. All the explorers on the deck did the same.
“…”
“…”
In the distance, something was rising from the center of the island, getting smaller and smaller, staring down at us.
It was roaring fiercely.
[WooOOOooOOOoooOOOooo!]
The good thing was that it only roared from afar. It didn’t seem like it was planning to chase us just yet. 
“Wh, what is that…?”
I muttered, looking at White Hecks, who was completely dumbfounded.
“It seems the friend who died back then wasn’t seeing things.”
An ultra-giant, over 40 meters tall.
Even among the Tier Leaders, there were none this size.
I have no idea how you would raid that size.
But even so.
Whoooosh-!
As the ship accelerated away from the island, I thought, ‘I guess we have to take that thing down too if we want to escape this island…’
How on earth are we supposed to take that down?
