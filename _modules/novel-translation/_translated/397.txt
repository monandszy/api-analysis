## Chapter 397: The Expedition (2)
The founding ceremony took place in a vacant mansion located in the Imperial City. It had been a kind of villa for a certain count, but he was in dire need of funds and had hastily put it up for sale. There was no need for renovations, so they simply laid out a feast and invited only the thirty members of the expedition and their patrons for a quiet founding ceremony.
And…
“It ended so quickly.”
The ceremony itself lasted only thirty minutes and ten seconds.  The marquis and other patrons took turns going up to the podium to give speeches of encouragement and support, lasting about thirty minutes. 
“I’ve already said everything about saving the country and heroes, so I’ll keep it short,” I began. “Let’s kill a lot.”
“And make a fortune,” I added, concluding my ten-second speech as the expedition leader.
The official ceremony concluded, transitioning into the banquet portion.
The banquet was attended by various powerful figures: the prime minister, Duke Kearlunas, the Small and Medium-sized Nobility Alliance, the Three Gods Church, the Alminus Trading Company, and the Adventurers’ Guild.  
However, despite the impressive names, the banquet lacked substance. The food, while plentiful, had been prepared beforehand and was cold. The orchestra that usually accompanied a banquet was absent, as were the servants to refill drinks and the numerous spectators.
Yet, no one expressed any complaints. They all knew this was not a gathering for laughter, revelry, and dancing to joyous music.
“Greetings, Mr. Suits.”
“I heard you fought four of them? How did you win?”
“Fought four? What are you talking about?”
“Ah, you were part of Lord Kaislan’s team, right? Lord Kaislan told you about it, didn’t he? About what happened then?”
“It’s been a while, Blood Lord.”
Although I remained seated, countless expedition members approached me, initiating greetings. 
“So, this is the life of a powerful person?”
“Welcome. I’m Lihen Suits, the expedition leader. Your name?”
“Ventis Gerodrao. I look forward to working with you.”
I greeted each of them, exchanging names and becoming familiar with their faces. After all, I was responsible for their lives. I needed to know their names and faces.
We had been engaged in these introductions for quite a while, when a familiar face approached me.
“I never imagined I’d see the name Lihen Suits at a founding ceremony.”
“It’s good to see you, Versil Goulond.”
“I, on the other hand, never expected to see you here.”
“It’s good to see you too, Lihen Suits.”
“My introduction was lacking. I am—”
“I know. You were the vice-captain of the Raler clan, right?”
I first encountered this woman when the first-floor Crystal Cave was reduced to rubble. We were short fifteen spots for the teleport to safety, and she drew lots to determine the discarded players. Our team was among them.
“I’m grateful you remembered, but you’re slow on the uptake. I’m no longer the vice-captain.” 
Versil chuckled wryly as she uttered the word “vice-captain,” then continued in a self-deprecating tone.
“I slept for too long. When I woke up, there was no place for me anymore.”
“Ah, you said you were caught in the blast.”
“Yes. I slept for over a year.”
“It’s good you’re awake now.”
“Yes… If it weren’t for the ‘Representative,’ I’d still be in that state… ”
‘Representative’ was a nickname for Tovera Church’s high priest. It was said that no other priest could match his level of divine recovery magic.
“Versil Goulond, what team are you with now?”
“The fourth.”
“The fourth… ”
The fourth team was led by the knight, Jun. I had received information about the team members from the marquis before the founding ceremony. There were four of them, all affiliated with religious forces.  How come there was a magician on that team?
“You must be in debt, huh?”
I had a pretty good idea of her situation. And she seemed to sense that I had an idea. She nodded at me with a meaningful gaze.
“You’re different from what I expected.”
“How so?”
“Don’t take offense. Everyone who heard your speech would have the same impression.”
Well, short speeches are the best. It’s a truth I realized when listening to the principal’s speeches in middle school.
“How long are you going to talk to that woman?”
Erwen cut in, standing next to me.
“Blood Lord… ”
“It’s been a while. The last time we met, you abandoned us, remember?”
“I regret what happened then. Truly.”
“Of course you regret it. That’s what happened because you abandoned everyone and ran.”
Her words were sharp, tinged with past resentment. 
Versil glanced at me nervously before bowing briefly and leaving.
“Good job?”
Erwen smirked, as if her actions had been for my benefit. I was too awkward to say anything, so I simply chuckled.
“I… It’s a pleasure to meet you. I’m Pike Neldain.”
As soon as the conversation ended, the members who had been lingering around us gathered once more, and I exchanged names with them and had brief conversations.
Then…
“You guys can relax here.”
“Where are you going?”
“Aren’t there still some people I haven’t greeted?”
“Why bother? They aren’t even coming here.”
“What’s got you so angry? I can always go there if they don’t come here.”
“It’s just… It’ll look like you’re losing if you go there.”
Erwen displayed an unhappy expression, but my decision remained unchanged.
“What’s the point of pride when it doesn’t even get you bread?”
I had to do what needed to be done.
“You are… ”
“Welcome. I’m Lihen Suits.”
“…McKelli Rayathers.”
I greeted those who hadn’t come to me, exchanging a few words. The marquis had only provided a list of twenty members, but more than a few teams hadn’t filled all their spots yet.
“Hold on, why is he here?”
While I was making rounds, greeting those I hadn’t met, a man’s face caught my eye.
“…Sven Parav.”
The vice-captain of the second knight order of the Reatlath Church.
He was sipping alcohol in a secluded corner, his face etched with worry. He looked a little surprised when he saw me.
“Do you know me?”
Of course I know you. I’d seen him a few times during my visits to the church, and due to a series of events, I was certain he was the ‘Goblin Mask.’
“Don’t underestimate the marquis’s information network.”
“I wasn’t underestimating it, sir.”
“Good, then. I’m glad to hear that.”
“If you’re going to rest, I—”
“Let’s talk for a bit.”
“Yes…?”
“Don’t you want to?”
“No, no. It’s just…”
No, it’s not. He looked like he didn’t want to talk to me. Actually, he seemed more nervous than anything.
“Did Jun tell you about me?”
“About the bet? Yes, he did.”
So, that’s why he was so tense. He’d heard about it.
“Then why are you here?”
“Why? We have to enter the labyrinth soon. We haven’t even greeted each other yet. I look forward to working with you inside.”
“Yes, I look forward to working with you as well.”
I only had a short conversation with Sven Parav before turning away.
I felt a sense of unease. Sven Parav is the Goblin Mask. In other words, there’s a high possibility he’ll leak information about the expedition to the community every time it opens, like a broken poison vial.
“Why did those religious fanatics choose a guy like him?”
How can I silence him? If I pretend to suspect him of being an evil spirit and put him under surveillance every fifteen days, he’ll log out right away.
“I’ll think about it later.”
I continued to make my rounds, greeting every member of the expedition, including those I hadn’t received information about from the marquis. 
Sven Parav’s presence was a negative variable, but there was a positive side as well. No Hans, no pain. 
The fact that Hans wasn’t here was a very promising sign.
***
The banquet that had stretched into the evening finally ended.
However, we remained at the mansion. After all, our existence was confidential. As most of the expedition members were well-known figures, it was decided that we would stay here and practice until the labyrinth opened…
“Practice, my ass.”
What difference would thirty people practicing together for two days make? If each team entered separately and met on the sixth floor, it would take weeks. By then, they’d have forgotten everything.
Therefore…
“It would be best if the battles were left to each team’s discretion, and we all supported each other in emergencies,” one member suggested.
After the leadership council meeting, they came to this conclusion.  They decided that forcing thirty people to move as one would only cause friction.
“Still, it would be wise to at least establish a formation in case of an emergency,” another member added.
However, they decided to categorize the expedition members for emergencies.  Magicians with magicians, healers with healers. They would give each member a mark on their chest so they could identify each other and be trained on where they should stand in an emergency, for greater safety.
“Warriors with a shield mark will stand on the outer perimeter, those with a sword mark behind them,” one member instructed.
“What about the healers?” another member asked.
“Of course, they’ll be in the center. They have to survive so they can heal those who are injured. Those with an arrow mark, the long-range support team, will stand in a formation protecting the healers and the magicians.”
Yes, that much training could be done within two days. No one in this group had any experience living together.
“Sir Suits, are you listening?”
“…Of course.”
“Don’t just zone out! It’s an important meeting, you know.”
“Well, I’m the expedition leader. They’ll just follow my orders. They have to.”
“And what about the expedition leader-exclusive commands? Are you ready?”
Actually, there were only two expedition leader-exclusive commands: Individual combat, where each team fights separately. And Assemble, where the entire expedition forms a united force.
“We’ll have more commands like ‘Charge!’, ‘Concentrated Fire!’, ‘Shield Wall!’, and more, but not yet. We’ll get there in time. For now, just these two.”
I didn’t have to memorize them because there were only two.
“So, let’s keep it at that for now. We’ll practice the rest of the formations after we gather on the sixth floor. What do you think?  You know, it’s a good idea, right?”
“Okay. Let’s do it.”
The meeting was structured so they could discuss and come to a conclusion before seeking my approval. After the meeting, James Cala, the former clan vice-captain, worked hard to teach the members of the expedition the ‘Assemble’ command. 
Two more days passed…
“We have entered the first-floor Crystal Cave.”
It was time to enter the labyrinth.
***
The Crystal Cave radiated with a vibrant glow. 
The members of my team were all wearing robes that covered their entire bodies. We were moving quickly. We had to avoid attracting attention.
“Clang! Clang! Clang!”
We had a magician and a supernatural user on the team who had lower physical abilities, but our overall movement speed was still pretty good. Both of them had their own means of transportation.
“Reard Aishde used the 4th-grade mutation magic ‘Fox Firelight’.”
The magician flew above us, transformed into a ball of light.
Then…
“Grold Aldidi used [Lucberta’s Dove Boots].”
The supernatural user used a top-tier item to compensate for his slower speed.
Amelia was curious about the supernatural user’s swift pace.
“…Is that a Number item?”
“It’s called [Lucberta’s Dove Boots], a Number item from the 3,000s. It has a limitation that it can only be used outside of combat, but… It’s very useful for someone like me in a labyrinth.”
“Doesn’t that drain your soul energy at that speed?”
“Haha, you underestimate supernatural users.  We have to raise our soul energy to level up, so we have more MP than any other class.”
“Don’t worry. I only use it until the third floor.  The passages get too narrow to use it on the fifth floor, and on the sixth… We’ll be using ships, so it’s not very useful there.”
Is this what happens when you have a top-tier adventurer on your team? Everything is prepared.
“Amelia, speed up.”
I gave a new order. It was such a strange feeling.
“Whooooosh!”
The ball of light flew like a meteor.
“Wheeee!”
Old Man Aldidi tilted his body and floated slightly above the ground as he raced forward.
“…Suits, why are you falling behind?”
“Just… in case, anyone… sneaks up… on us… from, behind.”
“Whew, I’m so out of breath.  I never expected to be the slowest in this group.”
“······”
Damn, I can’t believe I was the slowest of the fifth.
 // Yeah... I think it had a stroke...
