## The Mysterious Rift (5)
Makairo's stone chamber. 
A hidden space that appeared as you ascended the seemingly endless stairs in reverse.  This was the place where we had obtained the Mystery Box and acquired a new suit of armor. 
We had been shocked when we last visited. Makairo, the mid-boss, lay dead in his coffin, reduced to a mere skeleton.  
"..." 
"..."
Upon our return to the stone chamber, we were bewildered once more.
“Where on earth did this guy disappear to?  His corpse couldn’t have gotten up and walked away.” 
We opened the coffin, only to discover the corpse was gone.
“Hey, Aures.  You were the last one to investigate this place alone, right?”
“Y-yes…?”
“Was he there?  Inside the coffin.”
Lee Baek-ho asked, his eyes sharp as he searched Aures's face. Aures looked away and trailed off. 
“That… .”
“That what?  Speak clearly. Was he there at the time?”
“... I don’t know.”
“You don’t know? What does that even mean?”
“When I came here last time, I didn't actually open this coffin to check…” 
“Are you serious? You came all the way here to the stone chamber and didn’t even open the coffin?  You didn’t even make it to the chamber and just skipped out to slack off, did you?”
Lee Baek-ho’s accusatory words made Aures frantically wave his hands in denial.
“No way! I definitely came here!  My legs were aching, so I took it slow… !”
“Don’t be so hard on him.  It was just a mistake.” 
Jeina, who had been standing beside him, spoke up in Aures’s defense.  Was it because of her words that Aures's voice gained a new level of confidence?
“It’s not like! You’re the one who gave me the most annoying task! I went without complaint and did my best, but it's a bit hurtful to be spoken to like this…!”
While it wasn't exactly an insult, his words were infuriating.  We had assigned him the simplest task, though time-consuming, but even that was beyond his capability.
“Ha! Hurtful? Want to make it really hurtful?”
“Stop it. We were the ones who sent Aures alone.  We should have anticipated that he would be unable to handle such a simple task alone, but we failed. It’s our mistake.”
Aures pondered for a moment whether those words were an accusation or a defense, before finally nodding. 
“………L-like, like Ruingenes said!”
He seemed to have decided to interpret those words as defense.
But seeing him like that, I felt my strength draining away.  Was it wrong of us to have entrusted this task to him, like Ruingenes said?
Lee Baek-ho seemed to be having similar thoughts, as he let out a heavy sigh and didn’t say anything more.
“Ha…  Alright, it doesn’t matter now.”
“How on earth did the corpse disappear…?”
The conversation returned to its main topic, and everyone began to offer their opinions.
“There may be other interpretations, but I believe it’s possible that someone else is hiding within this ruin.”
“There’s no guarantee there’s only one person.”
“Yes.  Furthermore, if that is the case, they likely possess advanced stealth skills.  We searched thoroughly, but we haven’t found a single strand of hair.”
“Oh! Now that you mention it, maybe they’re bald!”
Lee Baek-ho nodded in agreement with the GM's speculation that someone could be hiding inside the ruin.
“It’s definitely possible someone is hiding here.”
“Yes, we should rule out that possibility—.”
“Well, it's possible there's a traitor among us.” 
This guy never changed.
Was it his habit to suspect his companions first?
‘He's practically got a disease.’
Of course, knowing about Lee Baek-ho’s painful past, I understood why he acted that way. 
But… .
“Stop suspecting your companions.  That’s something you should save for a true last resort.”
“... What did I say? I just said it's possible.  We have to keep all possibilities open, right?”
Lee Baek-ho, the little treasure, continued to grumble at my gentle scolding.
I sighed inwardly and changed the subject.
It was time to hear the truth.
“Alright, tell us the truth. Don’t even think about dodging or changing the subject this time.”
“When did I ever do that?”
When did he?  You’ve been doing it the whole time.
“Why did you come outside the walls?”
Why did Lee Baek-ho lead his companions outside the walls?
I had asked this question several times, but I never received a straight answer. 
“... What does that have to do with the current situation?”
“Of course it does. Everything that’s happened so far just doesn’t seem like it was targeting me and Ruingenes.”
Someone had destroyed the magic circle that led back to the city and committed suicide.
The mysterious man who had led us to the Dimensional Stele when we were searching for materials to repair the magic circle.
And now, being trapped in this golden ruin.
“Whoever's behind this, whoever’s pulling the strings, I believe they are targeting you.”
“... .”
“So tell us the truth.  We need to know your purpose in order to deduce what the enemy's purpose is.”
My resolute words made Lee Baek-ho look at me nervously before opening his mouth, as if he had no choice.
“It wasn’t anything grand. We just wanted to investigate the ‘gray world’ that the Baron mentioned.”
“Investigate? Explain properly.”
“We wanted to find out if the gray world was actually expanding.”
“You could’ve just watched it from afar.”
“No. Not really. It seems to be slowly approaching, but when you go back to check, it's further away again. It’s like the tide coming in and going out.”
“So what’s the conclusion?”
“We haven’t reached one yet. We wanted to run an experiment, so we just made some markings and were about to head back.”
About to head back. 
Those words made me think.
Perhaps someone was trying to hinder Lee Baek-ho’s actions outside the wall.
No. It’s more likely that their objective was to…
[Oh man, we’re screwed.  Grandpa said it would take at least a year.]
To prevent Lee Baek-ho from returning to the city.
That’s why they destroyed the return magic circle and erased any evidence.
‘And coincidentally, GM and I were also outside, so we ended up joining them.’
GM’s appearance, who could repair the magic circle quickly, ruined someone's plan, so they lured us to the Dimensional Stele and trapped us here.
‘……Is that too much of a stretch?’
Well, I don't think it's a stretch, but it lacks concrete evidence to say with certainty.
Therefore, I decided to continue asking questions. 
For example.
“That year you mentioned before.”
Perhaps this is the key to understanding the current situation.
“What is going to happen then?”
“...”
“Tell me.  We need to know that in order to have even a slight chance of deducing who destroyed the magic circle.”
“Ugh… this is giving me a headache.”
Lee Baek-ho rubbed his forehead and shook his head.  But perhaps he finally decided that hiding the truth wouldn’t help in this situation?
“This is the only time I’m going to say this, so listen carefully.”
Lee Baek-ho’s lips slowly parted.
“War.”
“...War?”
“Once the preparations in Noark are complete, they'll march on the Imperial Capital of Karnon and kill the King of Raphdonia.”
Is it my imagination, or is the smell of blood already filling the air?
***
They're planning to kill the King in Noark.
And Lee Baek-ho is likely deeply involved in this plan.
‘No, he’s playing a key role. One of this bastard’s skills can wipe out half the royal palace.’
The problem is that this creates too many potential figures who would want to stop Lee Baek-ho.
It’s hard to pinpoint someone specific.
‘But if I had to guess, it's most likely the royal family that’s behind this.’
This kind of insidious maneuvering is practically their modus operandi.
“But Baron, if they’re really targeting us, as you said, things are going to get a lot worse.”
“... What do you mean?”
“We didn’t go around broadcasting that we were leaving, right? We didn’t even tell the Count of Noark that we were going out.”
“So?”
“It means there’s definitely a traitor among us.  Either someone who’s fully pledged to the royal family and is trying to pull the strings, or someone who simply leaked information about our departure.”
Lee Baek-ho, with his characteristic tiger eyes, glanced at his companions.  Aures was the only one who flinched and shrugged.
‘This guy’s a warrior, but how can he have no spirit? 
 
I was pondering that when Jeina quietly whispered.
“He was beaten nearly to death once.”
“By Lee Baek-ho?”
“Who else would it be?”
Ah. 
I wondered why everyone else just rolled their eyes when he glared at them, but Aures was the only one who acted that way.
He slowly walked forward until he stood in the center of the group.
“Anyway, I think it’s time we ran some tests. What do you all think?”
“I don’t mind.”
“Me neither! Me neither!”
“It’s probably better to get this over with.”
Everyone agreed without hesitation.
That’s a response you wouldn’t get if there was a true traitor.
Had they finally decided that they needed to check properly?
“Alright, we have everyone’s agreement… .”
Lee Baek-ho pulled something out of his subspace.
No. 7234, ‘Skewed Trust’.
It’s the same one I used several times before. 
Does he always carry this thing around, even though he has truth detection?
“I think this one’s better at judging than my ability. We’re gonna use this, okay with everyone?”
Even with Lee Baek-ho’s aggressive move of pulling out Skewed Trust, everyone remained calm.
Whirrrrrr-!
He pressed the power button, and the hands on the dial slowly began to move.
And then. 
“Jeina Flyer, did you leak information to anyone about us going out?”
Lee Baek-ho questioned each one of them in turn.
As expected, no one hesitated to answer when questioned.
But was he still unsatisfied?
“Rex Aures, were you not at all involved in us being trapped here?”
He changed the question to completely eliminate any loopholes, asking the same questions in a slightly different way.
But no matter how many times he repeated it, the results were the same.
“No, I have not done such a thing.”
“Lee Baek-ho, stop it. We’ve already proven everyone’s innocence.”
“Really? Maybe there’s no traitor among us after all.” 
His voice was slightly less irritable, as if his suspicions were starting to fade.
But Lee Baek-ho was an even bigger efficiency enthusiast than I was.
“B-Baek-ho? If your suspicions are cleared, then let’s just—.”
“No, we have time left.  It would be a waste to not use it.”
“Waste?  What do you—.”
“Exactly.  Since we’ve already turned it on… let’s have some time to get to know each other better. We’ve been together for a while now, but we don’t really know much about each other.”
Lee Baek-ho’s voice was soft as he spoke, and he smiled as he looked at Jeina Flyer.
“Let’s start with the first question.”
“... .”
“Jeina Flyer still wants to kill me, Lee Baek-ho.”
I had no idea why this sudden question popped up.
But… .
“Answer yes if it’s true, and no if it’s false.”
His eyes and tone had lost all their playful demeanor.
Jeina’s expression hardened, and she answered in a cold voice.
“Yes.”
……How on earth are they all companions?
