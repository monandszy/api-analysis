##  A Changed Destiny (3)
There is a prophetess named Cassandra. She prophesied the fall of Troy, but the king of Troy did not believe her words, and ultimately, Troy was destroyed. 
Of course, the king had a defense. After all, Apollo, rejected by Cassandra, had cruelly stripped her of her "persuasiveness." This "curse" undoubtedly played a part in people not believing her prophecies.
However...
"Well."
Even if she had possessed "persuasiveness," it wouldn't have made much difference.
Who wants to believe in a dire prophecy? Even when someone pays good money for a fortune teller's reading, they'll storm out yelling about charlatans if they hear something bad. 
Would the king of Troy have really listened to the prophecy and nodded, saying, "Well, we're going to be destroyed!"? 
"I doubt it."
Just like me right now.
"Haha... Let's just calm down a bit, shall we? I didn't come here to fight the Lion Duke."
"It's not about fighting. It's about confirming whether or not I can trust your words."
As I spoke with a cold voice, the fellow, who had seemed startled at first, let out a chuckle. As if his act of feigned surprise was all a performance.
"Surely, you already know, don't you? About the elder's abilities."
"Oh, I know the old man's abilities well. He's a master at playing with people."
Even though my words were laced with sarcasm, the fellow remained silent and simply asked a question.
"Then why did you stop?"
It was a piercing question.
"You could have just passed me by and headed towards the holy grounds. What exactly made you stop?"
"..."
"The Lion Duke must have known deep down, didn't he? That you might regret not listening to the elder's advice."
I wanted to deny it. I wanted to claim I was only trying to hear what the old man had to say. False information is still information. I wanted to use it to figure out the old man's intentions.
But, as the fellow said earlier, I knew deep down. That wasn't the real reason.
"By the way, did I ask you if I would live or die here?"
"..."
"The elder didn't specifically tell me... Well, I don't think today is going to be my death day. Seeing as we're still talking."
"..."
"So, would you please loosen this? I'm starting to get claustrophobic."
Ugh...
"Bullshit."
Using the hand not gripping his collar, I ripped off his mask.
Whoosh-!
The face beneath the mask was incredibly ordinary.
A beastman in his mid-thirties, the kind you could see anywhere in the city...
Hmm, I wondered if I knew him.
"Haha... Was my face that fascinating?"
Seeing him, completely unfazed despite his exposed face, I calmly asked a question.
"Let me ask you just one thing."
"Ask anything."
"If you worked under that old man, you must know about the records."
"Of course."
"Then why do you keep saying the future changes based on choice?  It doesn't change, does it? From your perspective."
It doesn't matter if I believe in fate or not.
I was just curious why these damn fatalists were acting like this.
"Hmm... You've posed a very difficult question. Would it be okay if I elaborate a bit?"
"Go on."
"Imagine, a man is currently playing cards with other drunkards at a tavern. But the person dealing the cards accidentally shuffles the cards out of order."
I didn't understand what he was rambling about, but I listened quietly.
"If the cards had been dealt in order, he would have received a very weak hand. But because they weren't, he received a very strong hand. The other players are too drunk to notice the mistake. So, he keeps quiet and decides to take advantage of it."
I still didn't understand what he was trying to say.
"Now, I ask you."
He questioned me.
"Was receiving a weak hand his original fate? Or was receiving a strong hand his original fate?"
Even if I hadn't grasped the point of the question, I didn't need to think about the answer.
"Receiving a strong hand, I'd say. Since the dealer making a mistake is part of his fate."
"Haha, a good answer. You're quick on the uptake."
He said that, but honestly, I didn't understand it at all.
But...
"As the Lion Duke said, a changed destiny is still a destiny."
"And..."
"What we're doing is accidentally shuffling the cards. So that someone gets a slightly better hand in a 'very small game.'"
While I hadn't fully understood everything, I now had a general idea of what this guy was trying to say.
So, I asked this.
"So what happened to him?"
At my question, the fellow looked a bit surprised, but then he chuckled and replied.
"He ended up losing a huge amount at the gambling table. But because of the strong hand, he was able to minimize his losses a bit."
"So even a changed destiny couldn't change the fact that he would 'lose.'"
"That's right."
He smiled like a teacher giving a model student a sticker.
"But don't worry too much. That man, who kept losing and winning, eventually grew to become a much greater person in the far future."
As expected, his words weren't comforting.
It just made me even more determined.
"Now, decide. The Lion Duke has already received his cards."
I decided I would never discuss this topic with these damn fatalists again.
***
On top of the city wall, where hot flames and black smoke billowed up.
"..."
"..."
After a long silence, the fellow finally broke it.
"Is it that difficult to make a decision?"
"..."
"Think of it simply. If you were asked to lose either your car or your house, wouldn't everyone choose the car?"
Well, yeah. For most people, a house is more valuable than a car.
But the vast world is full of exceptions.
It's up to me to decide what's more valuable.
Right, so...
"I've decided."
After much deliberation, I had made my choice. The fellow's pupils dilated with curiosity.
"What will you do?"
He spoke as if he already knew everything.
Looking into his eyes, I felt a strange sense of exhilaration and shrugged.
"Why should I tell you?"
"..."
"Go away."
"Whatâ€”?"
I tossed the now-useless fellow down into the burning seventh district.
"Ugh...? Ugh! Aaaaaah!"
He wouldn't die just from falling here, would he?
Seeing him truly frightened and unconscious, it was clear he hadn't foreseen this future.
Bang-!
I watched until he disappeared into the sea of fire. It felt like a years-worth of frustration had been lifted. But the feeling of relief didn't last long.
"Ugh..."
A heavy weight, heavier than a years-worth of frustration, settled in my chest.
But there was nothing I could do.
"..."
I stood on the city wall, staring blankly at the burning city, long after I had thrown the fellow down. Then I started running again.
The holy grounds and the seventh district.
I ran towards the destination I had chosen after much contemplation.
***
How long had it been since I slipped into the comforting embrace of the wardrobe? I felt a bit uncomfortable, but still, it was far more comfortable than anything else outside.
Sven Parav decided he would stay in this wardrobe until everything was over, even if it meant shitting his pants.
But...
"Um... "
Was it too much to ask for his roommate's cooperation?
"Ah... Is something bothering you?"
"Um, can I just go out for a second?"
"Really...? It's dangerous outside the wardrobe, you know..."
"I know that, but... It's just for a second, really?"
Even as she spoke, her roommate, Lyris Marone, kept shaking her legs like a neurotic person.
Thanks to her nervous energy, even Sven Parav, who was often told he was clueless, understood why his roommate wanted to leave the wardrobe.
"...Go quickly."
Even for a short while, he was anxious about her being outside. But he couldn't come up with a reason to stop her from going to the bathroom, so he opened the wardrobe door as quickly and discreetly as possible.
And...
"I'll be right back... Just to the next room...!"
Marone left for the bathroom, and Sven Parav, for that short time, closed the wardrobe door and waited.
Slide.
The wardrobe door opened about four minutes later. Lyris Marone, returning later than expected, had a worried expression.
"Parav... Fire! Fire!"
"Really...?"
"The entire eastern part of the seventh district is engulfed in flames!"
The eastern part of the seventh district... That's the direction the eighth district is in... Was there some kind of 'incident'?
"Parav... Come outside and take a look!"
"...Yeah?"
"Come and see. It's not something to be taken lightly... We might get caught in the flames."
"Ah... "
"No, 'ah'... We might have to evacuate and move somewhere else!"
"Oh... I see... "
Even though Lyris Marone urged him to evacuate, he still had no intention of leaving the wardrobe.
But he was a little anxious, so...
"Could you please close the wardrobe door for a second?"
"...Yeah?"
"Just for a second."
He immediately closed the wardrobe door.
Thump.
The sound of the door closing calmed his anxious heart.
Clang-!
Though Lyris Marone opened the door again almost immediately, the brief period of peace he had just experienced was enough to convince him.
It didn't matter if there was a big fire or not.
As long as I'm inside this wardrobe, I'm safe.
An absolute certainty, beyond mere intuition, took over his body.
Of course, if he told someone this, they'd think he was crazy.
'Well, intuition has saved me many times.'
Sven Parav had been rescued by this intuition many times, and even Yandel, known as "the giant," had acknowledged and sometimes even relied on this intuition.
Therefore...
"It's alright, Marone. We're safe here."
"How can you be so sure?"
"Marone, you're a mage, and I'm a paladin, right? If we take turns using our abilities, even if the entire city burns, we can protect this wardrobe from the flames."
It wasn't an entirely unreasonable excuse.
Paladins have various abilities like shields, barriers, and holy enchantments. Mages are the same.
"Hmm..."
Maybe it sounded more plausible than 'intuition'?
Lyris Marone seemed to be swayed, and Sven Parav didn't miss the opportunity.
"There are countless Noirks out there, right? It's too dangerous to move right now. Even if we do move, it's best to wait until the flames reach here. The Noirks will be distracted by the fire then."
"Ah... That's true. Let's just keep an eye on things for now... "
Just as Lyris Marone agreed to hold out as long as they could inside the wardrobe.
"..."
Suddenly, Lyris Marone froze, her gaze fixed on the window.
At first, he wondered why, but then...
"...Aaahhhh!"
A piercing scream came from the street outside, and he finally understood the reason.
"Captain! We found a girl hiding here!"
"Aaaaah! Pl, please save me..."
"Haha! She's begging for her life! What should we do?"
His heart sank the moment he heard that conversation.
Thump!
No, no, no...?
He prayed in his heart, again and again.
But...
"Pa, Parav..."
Thump!
"...We, we have to save them!"
As always, his ominous premonition was right.
