## Chapter 503: The Age of Exploration (4)
The glittering light of the crystal cave shimmered faintly. 
Had it been the intense struggle with Dreadpier in this very space that left such an indelible mark? As I opened my eyes, I froze for a moment. 
[Just… stab one of them, and you’ll be safe.]
[You… will become a great… warrior.]
Damn, why do these memories, even when I try to forget them, always resurface? It was an experience I never wanted to relive. Yet, with each passing exploration, I couldn't help but fear that I would have to face them again.
“Sir… what’s wrong?”
“…Nothing.”
Erwin’s worried question pulled me back to reality. I quickly scanned my team, though there was only Erwin and Misha. 
…Misha, she hasn’t spoken a word since earlier. Still feeling uneasy?
“Misha.”
“…Ah, yeah?”
“We’re about to leave. Are you alright?”
“Yeah…,” she responded, her voice barely a whisper.
I made sure to include her in the group and we began our trek. Our first destination was the monument chamber at the heart of the crystal cave, where we planned to rendezvous with the other team.
…We’d split into two teams this time.
…We should probably recruit more clan members soon.
We’d split the team solely due to the number of members. Right now, we had exactly seven. It was inevitable we’d divide into teams of three or four. Of course, if we excluded Auyen, the numbers would work out perfectly at six, but…
…In case we need a navigator.
After careful consideration, I decided to include Auyen as part of the expedition. Several areas in the tower, including the 6th floor ocean, required a ship and a navigator. It was crucial to be prepared for any situation.
…Besides, if we fail to find the hidden area this time, we’ll have no choice but to move to the upper floors.
After diligently researching relevant texts during our stay in the city, I discovered a common thread for ‘hidden areas’: they appear in floors where significant accomplishments have been achieved.
The most notable example is the achievement of the Fairy King.
[The Fairy Archer Armela Powell Merhenia and her companions defeated the Coordinator Gregory and opened the hidden area.]
Coordinator Gregory is a hidden boss that has a low probability of appearing when climbing the Sky Tower without going up to the 5th floor. His defeat opened up a hidden area, ‘Larkaz’s Labyrinth’. Or, rather, it should be said, three types of hidden fields, including that one.
Anyway, the key point is this: the 1st floor will be closed on the 7th day, so if we don't make any progress by then, we’ll have no choice but to ascend to the higher floors.
“…There are so many people here.”
The central darkness was teeming with explorers upon our arrival. A stark contrast to the usual tranquil atmosphere. However, there was no reason to find this unusual. It was anticipated that explorers seeking ‘hidden areas’ would head straight to this location. 
Indeed, most of the explorers were clad in fine gear and proudly displayed their clan marks.
…There are even more than I expected…
As I entered the dark area, the explorers who spotted me cleared a path, their faces etched with surprise.
“Hey, that guy…,”
“Björn Yandell…,”
“Is he also looking for that place?”
Beyond mere curiosity upon seeing a celebrity, some even regarded me with a mixture of curiosity and the competitiveness of rivals.
“…If it's him, he might have some clues.”
“The fact that he was the first here means there could be something hidden here.”
Being famous can be a disadvantage in such circumstances.
“Misha, stop dawdling and stay close.”
“Ah… yeah…,” she mumbled.
We ventured deeper into the darkness, the passage illuminated by our torches. Soon, we arrived at the chamber where the monument stood. As expected, countless explorers had gathered around it.
“Ooh! Björnuun! Here, here!”
“Finally, you’ve arrived.”
“You’ve come, Captain.”
Two teams, having arrived before us, greeted us upon our arrival. I first approached Amelia for a report.
“Have you discovered anything?”
“Not yet. Several clans have wizards working on something, but they haven't found anything worthwhile.”
“Yes, I see…,”
I approached the monument, the wizards who were already working in front of it parting ways to let us through. Then…
Gulp-!
They watched my every move, their eyes wide open, searching for any clues. The situation was oddly amusing.
…Not like I have any more clues than anyone else.
As I stood before the monument, I felt a strange sensation. During my previous exploration, I’d found a witch’s altar instead of this stele.
What secrets are hidden in this labyrinth?
Despite my thoughts, I reread the inscription on the monument.
[In honor of the last sage, Diplan Groundel Gavrilius, and his great first step.]
The inscription remained unchanged. 
…The words haven't changed…
I carefully inspected the monument, looking for any changes or suspicious areas, but there was nothing.
I even touched it, but there was still nothing unusual.
Satisfied, I turned back to my team and asked, “Bersil, voice control?”
“It’s already on.”
“Alright.”
“Yandell, did you find anything?”
“Not yet.”
I wanted to experiment, but it was out of the question in this situation where everyone was watching me. Despite being hailed as a hero, I wasn’t that extraordinary. I always preferred my own cake, anyway.
“Let’s go.”
I decided to leave and return when the place was empty, but just as I was about to step away, someone approached me. 
“Baron Yandell.”
He wielded a sword, his hair was brown, and he was quite robust for a human.
‘Who are you?’ I looked down at him, and he greeted me with a noble bow.
“I’m Manus Stiliko, captain of the White Shark Clan’s 9th team. It’s an honor to meet you, Baron Yandell.”
Ah, that mark belongs to the White Shark Clan, one of the four great clans.
“Bersil, turn off the voice control.”
“Yes.”
“What’s your business?”
I politely turned off the voice control and asked. He cautiously got to the point.
“If you have any information about the hidden area, I’d be willing to pay a fair price to purchase it.”
Damn, was that it? I’d received countless similar offers recently. And if my memory served me right, one of the letters I ignored came from the White Shark Clan.
“Purchase…,”
Even if I had information, I wouldn't sell it for money, but I pretended to consider his offer.
There was one thing I wanted to ask.
“Is the White Shark Clan’s captain also on the 1st floor?”
“…He’s still here, but not nearby.”
“Is he searching the outskirts?”
“No. Our 9th team is solely responsible for searching for the hidden area in this expedition.”
In other words, everyone else in the clan, like in the past, would directly ascend to the upper floors.
“Surprisingly little support?”
I said this sarcastically, implying the information wouldn’t be worth much. He quickly responded.
“The clan doesn’t take this matter lightly. We’re just currently obligated to focus on the war due to our military contract.”
“The war comes first then?”
“Yes. Besides, if it's something we can find quickly, a single team is enough. If not, there's no need to go all out from the beginning. Not just us, but the other clans have made similar decisions.”
“I see.”
“So then… what about our proposal…,”
I ended the conversation.
“Sorry, but I decline.”
I already got what I wanted to know.
“…I see. Alright. Thank you for your time.”
We left the monument chamber behind.
‘The war can be helpful sometimes.’
I was worried that the area near the monument chamber would be crowded with explorers, but it was still relatively empty. The real competitors are tied up with the war. Even if the entrance is easily found, we don't have to worry about our share being reduced in this situation.
“Björn! Where are we going now?!”
“To the outskirts.”
It was time for me to show off my skills once again. The earlier we find it, the more we can get.
***
[Dungeon & Stone] is, without a doubt, the most unfriendly game I’ve ever played.
Boss monsters that require you to bash your head against a wall to figure out how to defeat them. Fields and rifts filled with all kinds of bizarre mechanics. Hidden elements so well concealed that you wonder if they were even meant to be discovered. I could talk for three days and nights about how unfriendly this game is.
Yet, ironically, the very ‘unfriendliness’ was the reason I became so engrossed in it. Back then, I was constantly battling against unbearable boredom, and I thrived on challenges. 
…It’s been a while since I’ve done a hidden element search.
[Dungeon & Stone]’s difficulty is determined by hidden elements—namely, how well you know them. If you don’t know anything about them, it’s practically impossible to climb the tower normally.
Therefore, I always searched for hidden elements like breathing whenever I played.
If I saw a statue, I’d search for ways to break it. 
I would always run along the walls and spam the attack button.
If anything felt suspicious, I’d cast every magic spell I could.
Sometimes I’d burn, freeze, or even throw the bodies of looted raiders at the walls.
And after almost 10 years of doing this…
I found countless hidden elements, and naturally, I learned a few tricks along the way.
…The problem is, I haven't invested in that aspect at all.
Neither did my companions. We're all geared towards combat.
I’d taken it for granted that we already knew about every hidden element.
…But at least I can read ancient languages…
Well, this ability is useless if the hidden element doesn’t require ancient languages.
But…
Kuuung-!
What can I do?
If you don’t have teeth, you have to use your gums. 
That’s how it’s done.
Kuuung-!
I started hammering the walls with my hammer, just like I did when I was playing.
Not just me, but my entire team.
Kuuung-! Gideok! Kuung! Deureureureu.
The symphony of hammers, daggers, and spirits against the cave walls and crystals.
“Ooh! This feels like a festival!”
Except for Ainar, everyone else seemed hesitant about this method. However, I insisted with a firm resolve.
“You have no choice but to do it! This is the basic method to find Gavrilius’s arrangement.”
“…The basic method?”
“It was written in a book I read a while back!”
I explained this to Bersil, who doesn’t know I’m a demon, and we continued our trek. We searched every inch of the surroundings whenever we entered a specific section.
Square crystal intersection. 
Pond next to a large rock. 
Moss-covered puddle.
The crystal cave, where the terrain and landmarks changed upon entry, had these fixed locations that appeared in the same spots.
And…
…Usually hidden elements are concealed in specific possible locations.
As we relentlessly smashed everything in our path, we eventually entered the dark area on the outskirts.
Huuuung-!
The portal connecting to the Goblin Forest was already open. There were no suspicious areas nearby.
Damn, it’s not next to the portal either?
We then chose a specific location and spread out to search the dark area on the outskirts. We repeated this process by moving far away whenever the search was completed.
Day 1, Day 2…
As time went by, we finally got our first result about two hours before the start of Day 3.
A medium-sized clan with about twenty members was blocking a passage? As if trying to hide something they’d discovered.
“I came back without pushing it because I thought it was better to tell you first. I was far away, so I didn’t get noticed.”
Yes, I see…
“Good job, Erwin.”
I led my team to the place Erwin mentioned, and there were explorers guarding the passage as if they were on lookout duty.
Turbuk, Turbuk.
I approached without hiding my presence. The explorers on the other side pulled out their weapons but flinched when they recognized me.
“Stop! Stop… Hey, Baron Yandell…?”
Well, they wouldn’t dare to act aggressively even if they recognize me.
“I want to pass. Any problem with that?”
As I approached, the explorers looked terrified, but desperately tried to explain.
“This is our current campsite… According to the explorer’s unspoken rules, we… please… step aside.”
Well, this is getting fishy.
“Unspoken rules… What’s that?”
“……?!”
“Don’t talk to me like that!”
I said this and immediately ran forward, smashing through the wall.
“Oh, oh…!”
“We can’t…,”
The explorers could only watch as I passed.
I went inside, and a dozen explorers who were gathered in front of the wall flinched as if they’d been caught doing something wrong.
“……!”
“……!”
Then, a heavy silence descended for a moment.
“What’s all this commotion… huh?”
A man poked his head out from a tiny gap in the wall.
“Oh, there was such a hidden path?”
“Uh, uh…. You are…?”
“Björn, Yandell’s son. Are you the leader?”
“Th, that’s right… but…”
“What’s in here?”
“Noth… nothing… uh, here.”
“Come on, I don’t think so.”
I smirked, and he shut his eyes tight and yelled.
“…Th, this is a place we discovered first!”
Oh, come on. You’re making us look bad.
“Discovered first…,”
“Yes, if you steal the achievements of explorers like us, it would—,”
“Did the explorers you met say the same thing?”
“…Yes? Wh, what do you mean…,”
What do you mean?
“Ack! Aaaaack!”
I grabbed his hair and pulled him like a radish.
“Sleeve.”
“……?”
“There’s blood on your sleeve.”
“……!”
“Whose blood is it?”
The blood hadn’t dried yet.
