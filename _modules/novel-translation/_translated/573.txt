Misha Kalstain was a traitor.
Ever since that information first emerged from the lips of the Butterfly, the Fox had been determined to dig deeper.  Even if I hadn't asked, she would have done it anyway.  After all, she would be forced to work with Misha in the future, whether she liked it or not.  She wouldn't want to remain in the uncomfortable state of having a traitor among her companions.
However, it was a question that posed a risk.
"This is the second time you've spoken about Misha Kalstain…," I said.
The Butterfly, her voice tinged with a subtle mystery, returned my gaze. It was as if she could see straight through me.
"You're quite interested in that beast woman, aren't you?"
“…So?” I pressed.
"Hee… Just saying," she replied.
It was possible that by the end of the round table, suspicion would be cast upon everyone in this room, assuming that the Fox was an ally of Bjorn Yandel.  After all, I had already revealed quite a lot of information about the underground first floor.  It was practically confirmed that she was currently within the labyrinth.
"Armin's expedition team and Hect's clan need even more reason to survive this and come back."
As the saying goes, you hide a tree among trees and a person among people.  The more survivors there are, the higher the chance of preventing Bersil’s identity from being exposed.
But that was a story for later.
"Can I ask a question now?"
It wasn't just the Fox, other members began to chime in with questions.
"From whom did you receive the code to enter the round table?"
The Queen was curious how the Butterfly managed to enter.
The Black Mask, for the first time, joined the questioning ranks.  It was surprising enough that he opened his mouth, but even more so the content of his question.
"Do you think Misha Kalstain poses a threat to Bjorn Yandel's life?"
What was that supposed to mean?
I didn't quite understand the reason for such a question, but the situation wasn't bad.
"Hmm… Everyone seems quite interested in Misha Kalstain, don't they?"
Thanks to the Black Mask stepping in, the suspicion directed at Bersil had somewhat subsided.  Or rather, the focus had shifted.
"So, it seems like we have three questions…," the Butterfly stated, her tone playful.
The question time was soon over, and the Butterfly, with a mischievous smile, took her time to ponder.
"Hmm, what should I do…?"
Now it was her choice.
If she answered the Fox or the Black Mask, I would be able to confirm what I had been wondering.
If the Queen was chosen, I would have to wait for the next round.
And if there were no third round, it was possible I would never get to hear it.
Therefore…
“You both asked, so it seems only right that I answer both your questions,” the Butterfly declared.
A wave of relief washed over me, though it was fleeting.
The world is a place where contradictions exist, where you want to know, yet don't want to know.
"So, which one of your questions should I answer…," she trailed off, her voice dripping with anticipation.
“Oh, forget it. I feel like it. They're both similar anyway, so I'll just answer both of your questions," she declared with a laugh.
At first glance, it seemed like a benevolent act.
But the more I listened, the more I felt suspicious.
After all, what business benefits from a 1+1 event?
Every action has a reason, and that reason is usually tied to one's own benefit.
"That's what I think first, is this also my fault for being too messed up?"
I didn’t know, but I opened my ears and focused on the conversation.
The Butterfly, who had been dragging out the words as if relishing the attention, was finally starting to speak.
"Misha Kalstain returned to Bjorn Yandel's side after receiving orders from someone. However, those orders had nothing to do with Bjorn Yandel's death.”
She seemed to be referring to the White Tiger and the Stone of Resurrection.
I wondered if she had been labeled a traitor for another reason.
"But how does she know this?"
Was the Butterfly perhaps a person on the White Tiger's side?
It wasn’t impossible considering she was the one who gave me the invitation code…
“Can we hear what the orders were?”
“Ah, that? As far as I know, it’s nothing important. It was simply to watch him and relay information,” the Butterfly answered casually.
“And the reward?”
“Well, only she knows… Ah, no, I can’t lie. I’ll leave it to your imagination.”
Based on my assumption, the reward was likely the “Stone of Resurrection” itself.
The White Tiger was too cunning for words.
He probably instilled fear in me, saying things like “you’re destined to die”, and then gave me the Stone of Resurrection, asking me to become a spy.
His true goal was to pass on the “Stone of Resurrection.”
Well, at least this conversation revealed something.
"Were there any other orders besides that?"
“No. Not that I know of,” she replied.
The White Tiger’s scheme ended with the Stone of Resurrection.
Of course, he might be planning something else behind the scenes, but it was unlikely that Misha was involved in that scheme.
However, the problem was…
“Why is she telling me all this so willingly?”
It made sense if the Butterfly Mask was on the same team as the White Tiger.
The White Tiger knows I’m an investigator.
"He must be trying to give me information naturally.”
He’s wanted the same thing from the start.
He wants me to lose all attachment to this world.
That's why he deliberately gave me information like Misha being a traitor.  Maybe that alone was enough to shatter my trust and make me suspicious of everyone around me.
It was a win-win situation for him.
“Can we move on to the next round then? I think I've given you all the answers you need.”
With that, the Butterfly’s turn ended and it was the Black Mask’s turn.
“What should I ask…?  I don’t really know anything, so there’s nothing to ask,” he said, his tone laced with sarcasm.
It was a common sentiment, as he rarely spoke.  He was shrouded in mystery.
However, that didn’t mean he had no questions.
“I'll ask this.  Why did you ask earlier if Misha is a threat to Bjorn Yandel's life?”
The Butterfly seemed to have grown curious about the Black Mask's identity, and the Fox felt the same way.
“Are you currently on the underground first floor?”
It seemed like she suspected he might be someone among us…
Only the Queen asked a question unrelated to his identity.
“You mentioned that Auriel Gavius was able to cross over to Earth through dimensional magic.  What is the source of that information?”
Surprisingly, all three questions were quite intriguing.
Of course, if you just considered the importance, the Queen's question was the most significant.
It was up to the Black Mask to choose the question he’d answer.
After a moment of silence, the Black Mask spoke in a brief voice, “I have never been to the underground first floor.”
He answered the Fox's question.
It made sense.  If he wasn't truly among us, this was the easiest question to answer.
"Did that answer your question?"
“Yes…,” the Fox replied.
With the Black Mask’s turn over, the Jester took his chance.
“Pfft, finally my turn!”
Did he really enjoy the attention that much?
"Well, ask away! Everyone must have a whole bunch of questions, right?”
Listening to his smug voice, I wanted to ignore him and leave him feeling foolish, but…
“It’s a shame, I’m the one who wants to ask you a question."
“Pfft! It’s a shame you want to ask me a question! I’m delighted!"
Despite the Jester’s annoying attitude, the questions came pouring in right away.
The Fox, the Wolf, the Goblin, the Queen, and the Black Mask…
Everyone except for me and the Butterfly asked a question, and the Jester seemed to be overjoyed about it.
“Five questions…  This is the most I’ve ever had! Pfft."
"Just choose which one you want to answer."
"But… isn't there still one person who hasn’t passed yet?"
The Jester, who nonchalantly ignored the Queen’s urging, glanced at me.  He was obviously expecting me to ask him something.
Was he really like a primary school student?
“Well, I’m not really curious about anything.”
“Hmm…  Really…?"
“Anything is fine.  As long as it’s an interesting story.”
I added that last part because I felt like I was disappointing him too much.
It was an unconscious action, but I couldn’t really call it a mistake.
He’s the type to reveal more useful information if you're interested in stories like that.
And that’s exactly what happened.
“An interesting story, huh…?  Well, I suppose that’s not bad.  Then, I’ll tell you all an interesting story.”
“Ugh… just ask the question or answer already.”
The Queen sighed, looking at the Jester who was trying to get my attention. 
But even while sighing, her eyes remained fixed on the Jester.
She was curious about the “interesting story” he was about to tell, wasn’t she?
“On the 154th year of the cataclysm, on the 2nd of August, the Noark forces, who had lived for a long time in the darkness of the sewer underground, went out into the world beyond the walls.”
And so, the Jester’s “interesting story” began.
“The world beyond the walls was completely different from the stories they had heard. There was no witch’s curse, and the green forest and fields spread as far as the eye could see.”
"So?"
"The Noark people wandered through the vast world, exploring the uncharted territories, and eventually settled down and established a new society."
“…Skip the weird concept and get to the point already—.”
“Pfft, listen carefully. This is the important part.”
"Go on."
“The Noark people questioned why the royal family had kept everyone locked inside the walls.  Why had they prevented people from going out into the perfectly fine world beyond the walls?”
“….”
"The Noark people pondered for a long time, and luckily they found the answer.  And recently, they finally made a momentous decision."
Tap, tap, tap.
The Jester tapped the table, drawing attention, as if to heighten the atmosphere.
And finally, he revealed the core of the story.
It wasn't clear how the story led to this outcome, but…
“They decided to invade Raphdonia."
A great war was on the horizon. 
***
Noark and the Royal Family.
The fight between the two had taken place only within the labyrinth after Noark had gone outside the walls.  Noark occupied the 7th floor and fought against the Royal Family forces, gradually gaining strength.
And now, that conflict was moving into the real world…
“Invasion?  Are you sure about this?”
“Pfft…  Do you think I’d lie?”
“When? When is it going to happen?”
The information the Jester had revealed was so impactful, it was beyond words.  Every member was in a commotion, eager to hear more details from him.
But…
“If you’re curious, find out for yourself!  My turn is over.  Well, maybe if I have a funny story to tell before this meeting ends, then we’ll see.  Pfft.”
The Jester stopped there, choosing a suitable point to end his story.
It was a bit disappointing.  I thought he would have used the momentum to talk more…
“I…,” I began, my voice hesitant,  as I sat there organizing my thoughts.
"How was it this time…?  Did you find it entertaining?”
To be honest, it was a reaction I didn’t quite understand.
“It seems like he revealed their invasion plans just because of me…”
Why did he feel so compelled to gain my attention and approval?
Especially since we wouldn’t see each other again after today.
I didn’t know the answer, but I replied anyway.
“Is that your question?”
Now it was my turn to receive their questions and answer them.
