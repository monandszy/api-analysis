##  The Rival (3)
Inside the community, all abilities are sealed. 
Therefore, the Lie Detection skill, which had caused me so much trouble in the outside world, was useless here.
Even if I could use it, I possessed the gift of Auriel Gaviss, allowing me to counter it.
However, that wasn't the point.
“Is he just testing me?”
There were two possible scenarios:
Firstly, Baekho, unable to discern the truth of my words, might have deliberately put on a stern expression to verify them once more.
And secondly…
Thump-!
He might genuinely believe I was lying.
“Damn it.”
My heart vibrated.
Perhaps I had underestimated him, even without realizing it. 
He had, after all, spent decades navigating this treacherous world. 
Just because he lacked Lie Detection didn’t make him an idiot.
In fact, his lack of the skill could make him even more sensitive.
He would have encountered countless liars, building up a vast store of knowledge about their patterns.
“The possibility of him simply testing me is extremely low.”
Within a split second, I had reached a decision.
“Rather than hoping my excuses would work, I should admit my mistake and apologize as soon as possible.”
However, Baekho spoke first.
“Hyung.”
“Hmm?”
“I’m sorry, but I won’t be returning Nyaong.”
“What…?”
Baekho’s response was laced with a cold sneer.
“Have you gone deaf living as a Barbarian?”
This was a tone of mockery I had never heard from Baekho during his time as Lee Hansu.
He looked me straight in the eye and said clearly:
“I won’t be returning her.”
“…”
“Nyaong, the one you cherished so much.”
My mind went blank.
“Isn’t that right? She’ll be more helpful to my goals than you, Hyung. You want to live in this world, don’t you?”
“…”
“Ah, don’t worry.”
I didn’t feel particularly angry.
“I’ll be sure to return her once I’m done using her.”
I just couldn’t help but laugh.
Even now, I couldn’t quite explain why.
“Baekho, you…”
My mind recognized this as a blatant provocation.
I knew that preventing further deterioration of our relationship was the right thing to do. 
“You’re a real mess, aren’t you?”
The words slipped out unfiltered, without a second thought. 
There wasn't even a hint of regret later.
“Wow, finally showing your true colors? You always just played it safe in front of me.”
However, Baekho only chuckled at my words.
“You’re hardly in a position to judge, are you?”
I raised my lips into a smirk.
As a matter of fact, no one in the room was devoid of a smile.
But…
Crackle, crackle, crackle—
Despite the warmth from the fireplace, a chill settled between us.
“This is interesting.”
“Yeah, I know.”
We mumbled back and forth, and then he spoke again.
“But I don’t understand one thing. Why am I the messed up one?”
He no longer used honorifics when addressing me.
“You look far more messed up, Hyung.”
I laughed again, unable to stop myself.
Perhaps he had a point.
“Your real life is out there, beyond this world, yet you’re content with being a mindless NPC, clinging to this place.”
There was no point in arguing.
He wouldn’t understand anything I said anyway.
“It’s fine if they’re just weaklings. You’re not stuck in a fantasy land where going back is just a dream, Hyung. You have abilities. Your companions, while not top-tier, are decent. You have a good reputation, and you’ve even achieved a noble title. And now?”
“What are you trying to say?”
I cut him off, demanding the point.
“Stop acting like you’re the only sane one. It’s repulsive.”
“…”
“You’re the messed up one.”
“…”
“Were you happy? Were you so fulfilled by meeting people? Did you feel like a real human being as you grew stronger with every game update? Did you dedicate yourself to the point where you felt like you were becoming a hero just because people showered you with praise?”
He wasn't entirely wrong.
If an outsider were to observe my changes, they would undoubtedly say something like that.
But whether it was a fact or not was irrelevant.
“Oh, you’ll probably thank Auriel Gaviss someday for all this—.”
“Alright, Baekho. I think you’re pretty pissed off.”
I kept my composure as I stared at him.
In a turn-based game, it was my turn to attack now.
There was no need for a long speech.
“But I understand. You’re the one who got rejected, aren’t you?”
“Rejected?”
He looked confused, unsure of what I was referring to.
I provided a clear explanation.
“Why are you pretending not to know? Everyone knows how many women rejected you after they found out you were an Evil Spirit.”
“………Huh.”
“You… that’s why you’re so desperate to go back, isn’t it?”
This kid was delusional.
I kept my voice low, so Baekho couldn’t hear me, but could he be some kind of freak who could eavesdrop on my thoughts?
“…”
Baekho’s expression twisted in an unsettling way.
However, it was fleeting.
“Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! K-k-k-k-kkkkhh! Puhahaha!”
Baekho burst into laughter, as if he had just heard the funniest joke.
The classic victory lap.
It’s just a ridiculous story, that’s why I laugh like this.
That’s the feeling.
As I simply stared at him, Baekho slowly stopped laughing and addressed me again.
“Hyung.”
“Why?”
“You like Nyaong that much? Enough to lash out at me like this?”
“It doesn’t matter.”
“It does. It seems like a big part of why you don’t want to go back.”
I remained silent.
“Wow, not admitting it even now. So our Hansu Hyung is actually a bit shy?”
I knew I was playing right into his hands, no matter what I said.
“Ah, wait!”
Baekho suddenly interrupted himself.
“I just had a good idea.”
His words sent a chill down my spine.
“About Nyaong…”
My worst fears came true.
“What if I just kill her?”
Damn it.
“The reason you want to stay in this world is because you’re so happy right now, isn’t it?”
With each word, my heart tightened.
“So, killing her wouldn’t be so bad. If this place starts to hurt, you’d naturally want to go back. Like a baby rabbit searching for shelter when winter comes?”
This was the fundamental reason I never revealed my true identity to Baekho.
“Hmm, it’s not a bad idea when you think about it.”
Baekho was capable of anything to achieve his goals.
“Sometimes, you just have to fix something by erasing it completely.”
He looked me in the eye with a grin.
A smile that didn’t fit the situation, a smile that was far too bright. 
I felt a shiver run down my spine, a primal fear.
But…
“Baekho.”
There was something stronger than fear surging within me.
“Why?”
杀意, Murderous Intent.
A longing to kill someone, a burning desire.
“If you keep this up…”
I didn’t need to use mind control to deceive someone like I did at the Round Table.
I just had to stop holding back.
It had been building up for a long time.
“I’m going to kill you.”
An intensity of murderous intent unlike any I’d ever felt.
“!”
As soon as my unrefined intent spread, Baekho flinched.
Of course, it was only for a split second.
Soon, Baekho’s mouth opened again, and the words he uttered were starkly different from anything I’d ever heard from him.
Not an apology,
not a complaint,
not a plea to stop.
What he uttered from within the murderous intent that would have made a corpse collector wriggle on the floor, choking and gasping, was simply:
“Wow.”
A genuine expression of awe.
“This Hyung is seriously crazy… If I was anyone else, I’d probably be dead.”
He praised, not praised, me, and then slowly approached, his shoulders rotating as he loosened up.
“Hyung.”
One step.
“You don’t remember?”
Two steps.
“I taught you.”
Three steps.
“Murderous Intent.”
As he closed the distance between us, his arm’s reach away, I felt it.
“!”
His murderous intent, his intent to kill me, coursing through my entire body.
***
Murderous Intent.
A dirty trick used by veterans to scare newbs.
I’d used it relentlessly at the Round Table, but I’d rarely been on the receiving end.
The only time I was targeted directly.
The day I joined the Round Table, when I was attacked by the Fox.
A strange sensation.
The feeling I had the first time I was subjected to murderous intent.
My skin tingled with the intensity of the intent, and my heart hammered in my chest.
And that was it.
“Now then…”
Baekho’s murderous intent was different.
From the density of the intent to its savage aura.
“Say it again.”
Now I understood why that Corpse Collector was trembling so much.
Thump, thump, thump, thump, thump-!
My heart pounded so hard it felt like it might burst.
The cold sweat had gathered, now dripping down my face.
Theoretically, this wasn’t a situation that required breathing, but it felt like someone was squeezing my throat, forcing me to hold my breath.
My brain felt like it was on fire.
But…
“What? I’m going to kill you.”
It wasn’t enough to completely break me, like it did to the Corpse Collector or the Fox.
Sure, it was tough.
I wanted to run away right then and there.
I knew that all I had to do was leave the chatroom to end this situation…
“Hyung, do you really think you can do it?”
But I endured.
Because I knew.
I had learned living as Bjorn Yandell.
Running away because you’re scared only leads to a scarier situation.
Yes, so…
“Huh?”
I forced myself out of the trance of murderous intent and took a step forward.
And then…
Thump.
From a closer distance.
“Not really.”
I looked down at him and whispered in his ear.
“I don’t think it’s impossible.”
I wasn’t bluffing to win a staring contest.
[You’re the one who beat the 10x boss, right?]
I was truly confident.
[If you give it 10 years, maybe you’ll be on my level?]
Sure, right now I might be slightly less powerful.
[I don’t really have anything left to improve on….]
If I just had a little more time—
‘Let’s see what a 10x boss can do.’
I could beat Baekho.
Did he sense my conviction?
Baekho, who had been frozen during my speech, managed to regain his composure and raised his lips into a smirk.
“…Interesting.”
Damn it, interesting?
“Don’t be so damn rude.”
I retorted, echoing the very words he had used to insult me.
“Why are you suddenly lying?”
Baekho tilted his head, confused.
I added slowly,
“You’re not…,”
“…”
“Having any fun.”
Otherwise, why was he stepping back?
“Whoa, whoa! Stop, stop!”
Baekho suddenly raised his hands in an exaggerated gesture, taking three steps back.
“Ah! This Hyung, really! You can’t even joke around!”
His expression and demeanor had done a 180.
I hadn’t even adjusted when Baekho began to speak.
“I would never really kill Nyaong. It’s just a joke. Just a joke! I mean, how much do I like you? I’ve been so nice to you since the moment we met!”
Nice? He's full of it.
Well, he does like me. In his own way. He probably sees something useful in me.
“Did you threaten to kill Misha for the same reason?”
“Relax, relax! Threaten? I told you, it was a joke! I told you! It was just a joke!”
Baekho was using a lighthearted tone, but the truth remained.
It was a threat, a real threat.
“Why would I kill Nyaong? I wouldn’t gain anything from it.”
Logically, that’s true.
Losing a Frost Dual-Wielding Swordswoman is bad enough, but it would also make me his enemy.
By any measure, it’s far from a rational choice.
But…
“If you had succeeded in threatening me, you could have controlled me from then on.”
Thinking about how the staring contest could have gone wrong makes my blood run cold. Our conversation would have been completely different then.
“Oh, come on! I’m not that kind of person! Hyung! I’m not a heartless monster!”
He wouldn’t have laughed then.
He wouldn’t have acted so subservient, saying “Hyung, Hyung” all the time…
“If you’re not a heartless monster, that’s good. Then hand over Misha.”
“I will. If you fulfill my request.”
He wouldn’t have offered a ‘deal’ either.
‘So, is this his Plan B?’
As I watched him intently, Baekho cautiously opened his mouth with a sheepish expression.
“I won’t ask you to come back with me. I now understand how sincere you are.”
“Just get to the point.”
“But we can still cooperate, right?”
Baekho stopped for a moment, then looked me in the eye with a sly gleam.
Of course, I had no intention of accepting.
“Just keep going.”
“You know better than anyone what your situation is right now, Hyung.”
Yes, I do know better than he does.
It’s not good, there are a lot of problems.
It’s like I’m walking on eggshells every day.
“So?”
“I’ll help you. So you can overcome these difficult times. In the shadows, in the open, I’ll do whatever it takes to help you. In return, help me when I break through to the 10th floor.”
Baekho’s offer was enticing.
He has no qualms about taking action, unlike me.
If he were to assassinate the Duke for me, for example, it would be a huge help.
But…
“Baekho.”
“Yes?”
“Before you ask for my help, there’s something you need to do first.”
“…”
I didn’t say any more.
I don’t understand why he wants me so badly.
“Bring Misha back first. We can talk about this later.”
“…”
“Your answer?”
He remained silent, even after my repeated question.
He seemed to be deep in thought.
Of course, if he hands over Misha, he loses one of his advantages—
“Hyung.”
He broke the silence,
“Today, we’re both too excited. Let’s stop here.”
His answer was a postponement.
“What…?”
“Isn’t that right? I can’t think straight now. So let’s talk about this again later. I’ll think about Nyaong properly. Okay?”
Okay?
“Okay—”
What?
I was about to retort when—
“Hyung, you said okay, right?”
“Huh?”
“Then I’ll go now!”
“Hey, wait! I—”
I stretched out my arm, but there was nothing I could do physically in this spiritual space.
Thump.
As soon as my fingertips touched his body,
“Poof!”
He vanished in a burst of light.
