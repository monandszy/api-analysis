Today's round table was unlike any other. It was a truth game, a format where we would answer honestly to whatever someone asked. 
"Pfft... How could I possibly refuse? I wouldn't miss this golden opportunity," the Jester said, their voice dripping with sarcasm.
To be honest, I was a little curious myself. What would the round table members ask the ‘Lion’ most? Well, I'd soon know.
"Then I'll... go first... ?" The Fox, who was first in the order, spoke up, hesitantly, in the silent atmosphere. 
"Do you... really know who we are?"
I was taken aback, but honestly, it was a perfectly reasonable question.  I had revealed the Clown's identity at the round table, and the Queen had also bluffed as if she knew everyone's secrets. The truth was, I only knew their nicknames. 
"Sigh…" The Clown suddenly let out a sigh, as if the Fox's question had been the most unexpected thing in the world. "Such a precious opportunity you're wasting with such mundane questions!"
The Clown seemed to take it as a given that I knew their identities. Or maybe it was even true…? 
Irritated by the Clown's condescending tone, the Fox shot back, "How do you know if it's mundane or not?"
"...Pfft?"
"After all, it's my right to ask whatever I want, isn't it? Stop trying to control me like that. It's annoying," she said coldly, her voice sharp as a blade. 
That was the Fox's true personality. Even when I first arrived at the round table, she was the first to lash out at me with hostility. Well, she did have her reasons back then. 
‘Those were the days… when I was a naive fool.’ 
It was all in the past now.  In the end, the Fox joined Clan Anabada and became my comrade.  Of course, she didn't know that yet. 
"Why are you so angry? It was just a joke," the Clown said, seemingly flustered by the Fox's anger.
But the Fox ignored the Clown's attempt to dismiss it as a joke, offering no response.
And in that tense atmosphere, the Wolf, next in line, spoke. "Haha... Now it's my turn!"
"I want to know where and how the Lion met the Earth Witch."
The Earth Witch…?  That was unexpected too. I thought she'd ask something related to Auril Gaviss again. 
Tap, tap.
I instinctively tapped the armrest with my index finger, diverting my gaze away from the Wolf and shifting my position to the side. A gesture indicating my readiness to hear the next question.
The Goblin, whose turn came next, saw my gesture and spoke hesitantly, "I… I don't know how to ask this, but…"
"Pfft, don't you know the Lion's personality? Don't be shy –  "
"Do you have any… wives or lovers…?"
The moment the Goblin finished their question, an indescribable silence enveloped the round table.
"Huh?"
The Clown looked confused, as if questioning their own ears.  The other members were similarly shocked. Everyone went silent for a moment, before finally grasping the situation.
Then their reactions changed. 
"What kind of bizarre question is that…"
"…Goblin, are you an idiot?"
"…Haha! Puh, puh… hahahahaha!!!" 
Some of the members scoffed, some cursed, and others burst out laughing.  They began to speculate why the Goblin had asked such a question. 
"Maybe it's… because of the 'fate' associated with that mask back then?" The Fox mumbled.
The Clown scoffed, as if the very idea was ridiculous. "Ha! You mean that absurd speculation from back then? That the Lion chose the Lion mask simply because they have good luck with women."
It was a story I had never heard before. It seemed like they had a private conversation about me while I was away. 
"Good luck with women…? What are you talking about?"
It was a story even the Queen didn't know about, suggesting it happened when the round table was still made up of only the founding members. 
"If you're curious, why don't you ask properly next time? Pfft."
"Never mind. I get the gist of it. Now it's my turn to ask."
The Queen skillfully deflected the Clown's attempt to provoke her and began her turn. "My question is simple. Have you ever met the Great Reformer directly?"
Her question was very significant.  Her intentions were hard to discern. She could have many questions, but she chose this one. It must be for a reason. 
‘Why…? Why is she asking that?’
Meeting the King. This topic had come up only twice in the round table. The Queen and the Wolf had both declared that they had met the King. 
‘Is meeting the King important?’
Well, it was more like something else was going on here. Or maybe, it was simply because there were so few people who had met the King.  Maybe she was trying to deduce my identity through this question.
“Hmm… my turn now?”  The Butterfly, whose turn it was, spoke up as I sorted through my thoughts. “What should I ask…?”
The Butterfly, who had always spoken in a playful tone, made a decision that no one expected. "I'm going to pass."
"What? Butterfly, don't you understand how valuable this opportunity is? The Lion is a mysterious individual, capable of knowing and answering everything!" The Clown exclaimed.
But the Butterfly's choice remained unchanged.  
"But… even if I ask, I don't think the Lion would answer my question."
"What? Why not? Without even trying— "
"Intuition, and experience," the Butterfly responded.
"……?"
"Men usually don't like women who make them uncomfortable," she added.
She addressed her answer to the Clown, but it was clear that she was actually speaking to me. 
‘She means her question would undoubtedly make me uncomfortable…'
Regardless, because the Butterfly skipped her turn, the Black Mask's turn came next.
What would she ask? I hadn't interacted much with her, so I had no idea. Maybe she'd skip like the Butterfly—.
"Bjorn Jandel."
...Huh?
Why did that name suddenly pop up?
I was startled, but I pretended to be calm, focusing on her words.  
“Bjorn Jandel and… Misha Calstain... ”
What? Could she also know about the 'Revival Stone' incident?
That thought crossed my mind, and then she continued, “ …were they really dating, like the rumors say?”
My mind went blank as the Black Mask completed her question. 
‘What the heck…? Why is she asking me that?’
Why would she ask me that, of all people? Did she know I was Bjorn Jandel?  No, even if she did, why would she ask that? What was her intention?
“Sigh… What is it with everyone and their useless questions,” the Clown sighed, annoyed that even the Black Mask had wasted her turn with such a pointless question.  "Fine, everyone's done. Now it's my turn."
Whatever the Clown asked, I wouldn't answer.  I had resolved myself to that.  As I was steeling myself, the Clown looked at me, then spoke in a hesitant voice. 
"So... I'll ask the Lion."
His voice was shaky with nervousness, unlike his usual self.
"If... if, I said…  " 
He swallowed, then asked me.
"If I said I wanted to give up everything and become your subordinate… would you accept me?"
What the hell is wrong with this guy? 
***
The round table fell into a strange silence after the Clown's declaration of wanting to become my subordinate. 
"What a question…"
"You made a big fuss about it, and this is what you ask?"
"It's a shame. If you were going to ask that, why didn't you just tell him after everything was over...?"
As they had done things that would bring karma upon them, the members' gazes weren't kind.
Of course, the Clown didn't care about their reaction.
"So... would... you... answer... ?" He asked again, with no trace of a sarcastic smile in his voice.  This wasn't a final scene in a dating program.
By this point, I was beyond feeling dumbfounded. It was beyond that level. He didn't even know who I was.  And he had no idea what I wanted to do.  I was just a mysterious strong person shrouded in secrecy, that's all he knew.  
And yet, he was ready to give up everything and become my subordinate…
‘What in the world is going on in his head?’
Was he like a teenager obsessed with gang leaders?  
I didn't know, but with the Clown’s question, the question time was over.
I had received a total of six questions.  Even though the Butterfly had skipped, it was the most questions I had received during any round table session so far.
Most of them were strange questions, though.  
"……"
"……"
Everyone fell silent, their eyes fixed on me as it was time for me to answer. Which question should I answer? 
I could see in their eyes that they desperately wanted me to answer.  Especially the Clown.
‘Ugh, it’s so awkward...’
I avoided eye contact, but my mind was hard at work trying to figure out the best question to answer. 
[Where and how did the Lion meet the Earth Witch?]
[Have you ever met the Great Reformer directly?]
I'd pass on these two.
In the Wolf's case, I had no idea where my answer would lead, and in the Queen's case, I didn't understand her intentions.
[Do you have any… wives or lovers…?]
[…Were they really dating, like the rumors say?]
Answering these two questions would make the situation too strange…
[Do you... really know who we are?]
[If... if, I said I wanted to give up everything and become your subordinate… would you accept me?]
That left two options.  And if I had to eliminate one using the process of elimination, it was easy to pick.  
It was a real pity, but...
‘I don't know everything about their identities. I know a few of them.’
An ambiguous answer like, ‘I know some of them’ would only destroy the mystique.
Therefore, I was left with only one option.
Tap, tap.
As they say, ‘strike while the iron is hot.’ I glanced around at everyone before fixing my gaze on the Clown, and uttered his name. 
"Avet Nekrapeto."
The real name of the Corpse Collector, who was hiding behind the Jester mask. 
I looked at him, my gaze unwavering, and firmly stated, "I won't accept you."
At my response, the Clown looked as if the world had ended, and asked why. 
"Why… ?"
Why, indeed.  It was simple.
"I'm not into raising bugs."
Even if he acted friendly at the round table, I would never treat him as anything more than a bug.  
[My sister... she won't move now. She can't speak. She's cold and hard. I haven't even been able to do anything for her yet…]
This guy was my enemy.
***
Swoooooosh—!
The green light symbolizing truth flickered on, but the Clown didn't say a word. He just stared blankly into space, like a mindless zombie.
"There… are you o— "
The Queen couldn't stand it any longer and was about to say something, but then...
"Puh, puh… hahaha…"
The Clown suddenly started laughing like a lunatic. 
"Puh-huh, a bug…  "
Hmmm, was my word choice a bit harsh?  
That thought crossed my mind, but there was nothing I could do about it.  These kinds of people need to be spoken to strongly, otherwise they don't get it.
"You're... amazing, Lion…"
After a while, the Clown, who had been laughing like he was having a breakdown, looked at me.  
"I thought I had some self-confidence, you know.  Puh-huh…"
A classic move of those who want to look cool. 
"A bug!  You calling me a bug! Puh-huh-huh...  You probably see everyone as a bug, Lion! Puh-huh-huh-huh…"
They think they can pretend to be unaffected if they just laugh, you see.  
"Heh… are you broken? What should we do?"
"Oh my, why did you even ask that question…? "
The members offered words of sympathy as they watched the Clown laugh like a madman.
I didn't care, though.
‘I just want this next round to start already…’
Should I step in at this point? 
As I pondered, the room began to shake violently, as if an earthquake were happening.  
Then…
Creeeeak!
The door to the room suddenly swung open from the outside.  This had only happened once before, during a meeting.
The Master. 
The being who created the ‘Guardians of the Round Table’, and...
The old man, whose true identity I now knew to be ‘Auril Gaviss’.  The last time he entered the round table, it was just like this.  
‘That was what it was like back then.’
I wondered what it would be like this time.
I slowly turned my head towards the open door.  
"Hee hee, I see some new masks," the old man said, chuckling as he looked at us.
