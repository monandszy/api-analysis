##  To the Future (2)
The monstrous 볼-헤르찬, a colossal creature emerging from the 7th floor, lived in a designated field in a pack. Obtaining its Essence would be fairly easy if you met the necessary specifications, which is why I opted for the 바이욘 Essence during the royal rewards ceremony, knowing it would become increasingly difficult to acquire in the future. But...
"In truth, this one was better for combat ability."
While 바이욘's [Transcendence] skill offered versatility, variable creation, and the potential for unique skill combinations, the 볼-헤르찬 Essence focused solely on one thing: physical resistance. This was the stat any tank needed more than strength. Moreover, one of the 볼-헤르찬's active skills could block aura, making its Essence crucial for my path to becoming a formidable shield-wielding Barbarian.
"The issue is... the Essence's color."
The color of the Essence determined its active skill. This was the primary reason why advancement became increasingly difficult as you ascended higher floors. While higher-level monsters were harder to hunt, from the 3rd tier onwards, each had at least five or six possible Essence colors.
It was too early to celebrate. Not yet, at least...
"Amelia, do you happen to remember what color the Essence was?"
"Hmm... It was probably green."
Green?
"Hallelujah..."
I let out an involuntary exclamation, causing Amelia to frown. It was fair; it was a term she had never heard before.
"Is that a saying from your homeland?"
I explained it was simply an expression used when someone got lucky, excluding its religious connotation. Amelia nodded, saying "I see." Then she glanced at me with an air of disappointment.
"You give me that look when I mention demons, but..."
Ah, right.
I had reacted poorly when she called me a demon. It must have seemed hypocritical.
"I wasn't trying to be harsh only to you. It's just... I get too comfortable around you. I'll be more careful."
"...Fine."
Amelia coolly accepted my apology, and the matter was closed. I then proceeded to ask the most important question.
"But, Amelia..."
"Stop giving me that look and just ask."
Fine, if that's how it is.
"Do you… do you know how much it went for?"
I asked, trying to suppress my trembling emotions. Amelia chuckled and stood up from her seat, walked to my side, bent down, and whispered into my ear.
"...!!!"
My entire body trembled as if I had been jolted with electricity.
No way, how could it be that expensive?
***
Initially, the price shocked me to the core, but upon closer examination, it wasn't unreasonable. It was a 3rd tier Essence, after all. And, since it was sold through the exchange rather than the celestial auction, the number of bidders would have been significantly higher. Many wealthy individuals had money but lacked the qualifications to participate in the celestial auction.
In any case, that wasn't the point.
"Amelia..."
"Spit it out."
"It's just..."
Amelia, who had already returned to her seat, crossed her legs and folded her arms. It was difficult to continue the conversation with her in that posture.
"Uh... It's just..."
As the silence dragged on, Amelia sighed and scratched her itchy arm.
"You're wondering how much you'll get if you sell all your gear, right?"
"Yep."
"Probably… around 70%. That's assuming you sell it at a decent price and take your time."
Right, as I thought.
"...Guess I have no choice but to give up."
It wasn't simply a matter of being short by 30%. 
I had spent over half a year gathering loot, collecting the wealth of ten other raiders like myself. It was nearly impossible to accumulate 30% of that amount in a short period. Amelia seemed to think the same, judging by her expression.
"...It was the Essence you wanted, wasn't it?"
"Yeah..."
"Don't get too discouraged. You'll get the Essence you want with our own hands later."
I understood that, but...
"Ugh..."
Despite Amelia's consolation, sighs kept escaping my lips. I should have just ignored it if I knew this would happen. It felt like someone snatched away a birthday present they accidentally gave me. After all, the Essence's color was perfect, too. I even felt a sense of destiny—
"Well, there's a way if you really want it..."
Amelia's voice interrupted my thoughts, and I lifted my head from the table.
"A way...?”
Amelia avoided my gaze. At first, I thought it was because she was uncomfortable with my gaze, but a closer look revealed that she wasn't simply looking at nothing. It was more like she was fixated on something.
"What the hell is she staring at so intently..."
Unwittingly, I looked in the direction Amelia's gaze was fixed on and stood up in a gesture of shock. I couldn't help it.
Kraw's Devil Crusher stood there, leaning against the wall, its imposing presence impossible to ignore.
"No, this is out of the question!"
"Why? It's not like you're getting it back to your original timeline anyway."
"I'll bury it and hide it well!"
"But there's still a risk. Selling it and using the money to buy the Essence would be the most reasonable option."
Amelia was right.
Even if I hid it well, there was no guarantee that it would still be there in twenty years. On the other hand, I could definitely bring the Essence back with me. 
But...
"Are you crazy?! You want to sell a warrior's weapon?!"
"Your speech is suddenly becoming very Barbarian-like."
"Ah, it's a habit..."
"I had a feeling that was the case."
Why did the conversation suddenly go in this direction?
I returned to the topic at hand, resolutely continuing.
"Anyway, I'm not selling this. Don't even think about it again! I'd rather give up on the Essence!"
It wasn't just stubbornness.
Even if it was a 3rd tier Essence, its rarity couldn't be compared to a Double Number item. Double Numbers were incredibly rare, even in the celestial auction. Well, the price difference might be negligible, or the Essence might even be more expensive depending on the demand...
But, in terms of acquisition difficulty, Kraw's Devil Crusher was at least ten times harder to obtain. In simpler terms, if I sold it now, I wouldn't know when I would get another chance.
"Hmm, I see."
Amelia readily conceded after I explained my reasoning in detail.
The conversation ended there. Amelia said she was going to see her sister and left, while I stayed in the room, drinking to soothe my aching heart.
"Ha, the alcohol... tastes better today..."
How long would it take to get that Essence?
I had no clue, but it would definitely take at least a year. First, I needed to return to my original timeline, reorganize the clan, upgrade the ship gradually, break through the 6th floor, and reach the 7th floor before I could even encounter the 볼-헤르찬.  
The grind to obtain the right color would be another story altogether.
"Ugh, 볼-헤르찬..."
As I sat there, drowning my sorrows in alcohol, the door creaked open.
"Did you really stay here drinking all this time?"
It was Amelia, who had been by her sister's side all day and only returned after sunset.
"Heehee, you're back, Amelia..."
"Close the door properly, I told you..."
"...Sorry."
"...You're apologizing?"
"I'll make sure to close the door properly from now on. It's not like we have the Essence here, you know. If some assassin who can use aura comes in, I'll be toast..."
Was it because I was drunk?
My emotions overwhelmed me, and I couldn't continue.
Amelia sighed heavily, looking at me.
"The smell of alcohol is practically vibrating."
I couldn't argue; I was wrong as a roommate. With my head bowed, Amelia cautiously began to speak.
"But, Yandel..."
"..."
"Is that Essence… really that important to you?"
"Huh...?"
For a moment, I felt a wave of clarity. And it was understandable.
It was like a tired mother asking her son who is lying down in the toy aisle.
"Do you… do you have a way to get it...?”
My voice carried a sliver of hope. Amelia exhaled, as if letting out a dry laugh. 
And...
"Don't get your hopes up."
"You mean...!"
I was speechless with excitement.
"No, I told you not to get your hopes up. It's just... there might be a way."
It was a kind of mature assurance I had never experienced before.
***
From that day onwards, Amelia would leave every morning and return to the room late at night, looking exhausted. However, she wouldn't answer when I asked what she was doing.
Maybe it was because she didn't know if her plan would work?  She might have been waiting for a successful outcome before telling me?
[If things go well, I'll figure out the money situation. So you focus on what you can do until the auction. Don't just stay cooped up in the room all day.]
[Amelia…!!!]
I couldn't dare disobey Amelia's orders, so I went outside diligently.
There was only one goal:
To find a safe place to hide Kraw's Devil Crusher for twenty years.
"Ha, the forest near the holy site seems perfect, but there's a chance someone might dig it up during a burial..."
Finding my own private stash was much harder than I expected. Even when I thought a place seemed decent, a closer examination always revealed a flaw. Not a hundred percent safe, you know?
"The sewers are too crowded with vagrants… and I can't enter other races' holy sites freely, so that's out…."
If Amelia failed to secure the funds, I needed to find a place to hide both the weapon and the money, making it even more crucial to choose an absolutely secure location.
There were other things to worry about, though.
"But if she really does get the money, what then?"
My current level is 6.
I can equip a maximum of six Essences, and all six slots are currently filled.
To acquire the 볼-헤르찬 Essence, I would need to level up or delete one of my existing Essences.
However, reaching level 7 would require me to conquer at least half of the 6th floor, so that wasn't something I needed to think about for a while.
"Which one should I get rid of?"
Orc Hero, Ogre, 바이욘.
These three were core Essences and weren't going anywhere. Stormgush was a 3rd tier Essence and too valuable to delete.
It significantly improved my basic stats.
That left me with two options.
"Manticora."
My only mobility skill and a 5th tier Essence I planned to eventually delete from the beginning.
And...
"Corpse Golem."
The 7th tier Essence, Corpse Golem, I reluctantly consumed to survive.
It was the lowest tier I owned, but choosing was difficult.
"It'd be awkward without it..."
The usefulness of this Essence needs no explanation.
"Pain Resistance" stat. How much did it help my survivability?
Even the skills I considered trash, [Flesh Explosion] and [Acidic Fluid], turned out to be lifesavers during combat.
But...
"I need to graduate from it, though. I didn't plan on using it this long."
If I had to choose one, I'd keep Manticora.
It's simple.
Even with a 20% stat refund from [Inheritance], my 200+ Armor would plummet down to 40.
Deleting it now would mean I needed to find another mid-tier Essence to maintain balance until I could acquire the "Bellarios" Essence.
"Well, it wouldn't matter if Amelia can't get the money."
The thought of needing an even better hiding place in case of failure led me to explore the city more diligently, and time flew by.
Then...
"Only three days left."
It was three days before the auction.
I placed the clock on my nightstand and lay down on my bed.
"What will happen this time?"
It was midnight on the 15th.
***
"Well, I'm here at least."
I woke up in a room that looked like all the rest, and immediately put on the mask hanging on the wall.
Then I hurried out.
"..."
The empty hallway echoed with silence.
But, if my guess was right, the GM, the new Master of this space, would be somewhere in this mansion.
"Let's take a look around."
I roamed the hallway, meticulously inspecting the mansion. I didn't see any of the existing members, such as the captain or the Destroyer.
"Come to think of it, what happened to them..."
As I pondered, a white man stood in the main hall on the first floor, staring blankly into space.
He obviously wasn't a demon.
He was wearing a tracksuit with a familiar logo.
"Could he be the GM?"
I took a step forward to get a closer look.
Did he sense my presence?
"Someone...?!”
The man looked around, his eyes meeting mine, and he flinched.
"..."
Silence fell for a moment as we studied each other.
"Unexpected."
He had kind of goofy-looking features. His eyes were full of confusion. He seemed to be afraid of me...
"Uh... Who are you? You said that everyone who was originally here has been expelled..."
"Original members were expelled, huh..."
While he was on guard, he was also spilling information he hadn't been asked.
I could smell that strong newbie scent.
"Yeah, even if he's the GM, he's only been here for a year. He's still wet behind the ears."
How could I make the most of this? 
My mouth watered.
Was that why...
"Uh... Elder? You're the Elder, aren't you?"
He asked, looking so innocent.
I couldn't help but lick my lips.
