## Chapter 549: Secret Room (2)
A giant hamster that spoke human language. Even in this fantastical world where magic and different races coexisted, it was a peculiar sight. Monsters couldn't communicate.  While some could speak, they usually repeated pre-programmed phrases. But this...
[Let me go! I said let me go! You insane rebels!]
...What the hell was this?
My brow furrowed involuntarily. This creature spoke in the Ancient Tongue.  Unfortunately, I had encountered a monster using the Ancient Tongue just recently. Could this be a coincidence?
My suspicion deepened with every passing moment.
"Mr. Yandell, what's wrong?"
"Is there something wrong?"
What was with their reactions? I blurted out my question immediately upon sensing something amiss.
"You mean to tell me you can't understand what this thing is saying?"
"...What? It's talking?"
"I didn't hear any words. Just an unpleasant shriek."
"Ah! Me too!"
This was a whole new level of suspicious. As I continued to scrutinize the hamster, it had stopped struggling and was looking up at me.
[You… can you understand me?]
Is it asking if I can hear its voice?  I had no reason to answer. So, I applied enough pressure to prevent it from moving, and tried to communicate with it using the Ancient Tongue.
"You."
[Ugh... let me go... you savage…  Do you even know who I am…!]
Who knows who you are? I mean…
"What is your relationship with the village chief?"
I went straight for the jugular.  I needed to confirm if this creature was a spy sent by the chief.
[…?]
The creature seemed clueless, so I tried another approach. I mentioned the chief's other name.
"Cornelius Brunngrid. Have you never heard of him? A creature like you, using the Ancient Tongue?"
If it denied knowing him, I would immediately summon an expert for interrogation.
[You insolent fool! I am no mere creature…!]
"Enough, just answer my questions."
I tightened my grip on its hand, then released it.  The creature hastily spoke up.
[I, I don’t know! I said I don’t know! So stop! Stop pressing! I’m going to… I’m going to throw up…!]
"You don't know? That's a shame. Now I'll have to find out myself."
[Find out yourself…?]
You'll find out yourself soon enough.
I turned to Amelia, who pulled out a dagger and checked the edge.  Did she see her own future in this sight?
[Wait! Just a moment!]
"Did you finally remember something?"
[The, the Ancient Tongue…! If you’re talking about a ‘creature’ who uses the Ancient Tongue, then there is one I know! The… one who rides a dragon!]
…A dragon rider?
The chief’s alias during his human days was ‘Dragon Knight’, but…
"Amelia, wait here."
I kept the conversation going while pushing Amelia back.
"Tell me everything about this dragon rider."
[I, I don’t know much…! But I remember him visiting here once. A monstrous creature with blue skin and enormous eyes! He had countless followers, and he spoke the Ancient Tongue! He used the Ancient Tongue!]
He was definitely talking about the chief. There were probably no other creatures with blue skin and large eyes who also used the Ancient Tongue.
‘So the old bastard was lying to me after all.’
He told me he couldn't go outside, and didn't know what was beyond. Now it seemed all a big fat lie.
"When did they come here?"
[It was long ago. Too long to even count.]
"I'll decide if it's too long to count, so answer in numbers."
[I, I don’t know exactly!  The monstrous creature last visited here long ago, but the sky has opened countless times since then…!]
The sky opened.  This phrase likely referred to the rainy season…
That would explain why he said it was too long to count.
‘If the rainy season happened 10,000 times… that would be about 833 years in the outside world.’
But it had opened countless times more than that?  This meant the chief visited here thousands of years ago.
Enough of these calculations.
"What does it mean to ride a dragon?"
[It’s exactly what it sounds like!  Every time he came here, he brought countless followers on that massive dragon!]
"Every time? Meaning he came here many times?"
[He did, often back then. He stopped coming here at some point…]
"What did the chief do here back then?"
[He did the same thing you’re doing right now!  He’d pick up my carefully organized books and scatter them everywhere! I really—!]
"Wait, you organized the books?"
[…Yeah, I did.]
What the hell was this thing?  So far, everything it said seemed plausible, not a complete lie.  To be honest, I was less suspicious of this being a spy and more curious about its identity.
"Why did you organize the books?"
The most important factor in understanding a person is their motivation. 
I asked this question, but the answer I received was vague.
[That, that’s… because it’s my job…!]
"What...?"
[To organize the books…  It’s my job. It’s been my job since I was born here!]
"So… you exist to organize books?"
[That, that’s not quite it… I just have to do it. It’s my job.]
It didn’t seem to be trying to hide anything.  I continued to press for answers, but the creature never wavered from its response.
[…Ugh! You idiot! You think everything needs a reason! It just is! It’s just like that! I have to organize the books!]
I asked why, but it seemed like it was asking itself the same question.  It then went into a furious rant.
‘This thing doesn’t even understand its own actions.’
I doubt I would get anything more out of it. Time to move to the next stage.
"So, is there anything else here?"
[…?]
"You know, anything special. Like, rare books, treasures, strange creatures, hidden rooms… or anything you want to hide from outsiders."
[….]
"Nothing?"
The hamster recoiled at my question.
[…No! No, no, no!!!]
A strong denial is sometimes a strong affirmation.
"Right…"
[…!!!]
"There is something, isn't there?"
My mouth started watering.
***
The conversation followed a similar pattern.
[No, I told you there’s nothing! What are you talking about!]
The hamster repeated itself like a parrot. And…
"Look, I just said I’m looking, not taking anything."
I, a barbarian, simply ignored it.
[How many times do I have to tell you!  Nothing like that is here!]
"Who said I was trying to steal it? I just want to see it. Why are you so persistent?"
[….]
This thing really couldn’t take a hint.  I’d had enough of its pleasantries.
"Listen."
My voice lowered. The hamster flinched and looked up, alert.
[…?]
"Am I your friend? Can’t you understand the situation?"
[…I, I don’t know… It’s just… It’s just that there’s nothing here… Really, I swear….]
"Alright, then tell me something else."
[Something… else…?]
"Something like, do you know how to get out of here?"
[………I don’t.]
"What about the chief’s weakness, or any secrets?"
[….]
"What do you want me to do with you? I need a reason, don’t I?"
[A reason…?]
"Yeah, I need something in return before I let you go or anything. Or should I check if you have any essence?"
[….]
See, the thing just clams up when it doesn't know what to say. Is it really that precious?
My attempts at intimidation had failed. I decided to switch tactics.
"Listen, tell me something about yourself."
[…?]
"What are you? Why are you here? How did you learn to talk?"
[Ah, that….]
Maybe this topic was a bit easier? The creature finally answered, albeit without any real substance.
"So, you were born here and you always knew how to talk?"
[Yeah… that village chief… that guy was the first living being I saw.]
"Does the chief know about you?"
[He probably doesn’t. He saw me talk, approached me, and tried to communicate… but the idiot couldn’t understand what I was saying.]
"Like the others, right?"
[But what about you! How do you understand me? Why aren’t you scared of me!]
What the hell is this thing’s problem?
"You’re the one who should be explaining, why are you asking me?"
[….]
"Just answer this. You say people are afraid of you? Do you have some kind of ability?"
[…I don’t know. Everyone was like that. The village chief drew his weapon as soon as he saw me. You guys weren’t much different… So, I thought I would scare them away… but….]
"And that’s how you ended up here."
[….]
"But why am I okay? I just see a regular rat."
[A, a rat! I am no rat!!]
"What are you then? Do you have a species name?"
[That, that’s… not it….]
"Then what’s your name? Do you have a name?"
[…I don’t need a name.]
"Oh come on, you think you can live in isolation your whole life…?  Names exist for everyone’s convenience.  So, I’ll give you one."
[…You’ll give me one?]
"Yeah."
The creature, who’d been alone in the library for thousands of years without a name, seemed a little pitiful. I took my time and gave it a name.
"Hamsik."
[…?]
"Hamsik, from now on, that's your name."
[….]
"What? Problem with the name?"
"I'm Bjorn, son of Yandell. Yandell is the family name, Bjorn is my name. Just call me Bjorn."
[Bj, Bjorn… okay.]
Alright, introductions done.  Time to pick up where we left off.
[So… are we friends now…?]
Hamsik asked abruptly, its voice timid and uncertain.
I tilted my head, and Hamsik averted my gaze, muttering to itself.
[But…  I think friends call each other by their names… I know that much…]
"Where did you learn that?"
[I don’t know. I knew it from the moment I was born. It’s part of the language system I have.]
"Really?"
I was starting to think this thing was quite the mystery. But regardless of my assessment, I had a plan.
‘I know how to handle this.’
I released the creature and helped it stand.
Then, extending my arm, I said, “Hamsik, it’s good to meet you.”
[…?]
“Why, if we call each other by our names, we’re friends, right?  Friends usually shake hands. Oh, you don’t know what shaking hands is, do you?”
[Ah, no! Of course I know!  I, I…  It’s good to meet you, too…?]
How badly did this thing want a friend? 
I didn't know, but this was our “friends” pact.  
"Alright then, tell me. Where is it? The treasure you’re hiding?"
[…!]
It was time for the friend tax.
***
Hamsik looked up at me with betrayed eyes, taking a step back.  Oh, come on, we’re friends here.
"Hamsik, let me tell you something. There are no secrets between friends."
[But… but….]
"Do you not consider me a friend?"
[Beep, beep….]
Hamsik made a squeak, indicating its distress.  I didn’t push it further. I waited patiently.
After what seemed like forever…
[Ah, alright…  I’ll show you… but… don’t touch anything inside! You got it?]
"Yes, yes, of course."
Hamsik seemed relieved to have made its decision.  It raised its index finger, like a dancer, showing off its abilities to its new friend.
And then...
Swoosh.
The books on the shelves began to slide out, half hanging from the shelves.
‘So, it’s a secret room activated by selecting specific books?’
As I watched, mesmerized, the books stopped moving.
And then…
Thud, thud, thud, thud, thud, thud, thud!
The stone door opened, revealing a hidden space.
