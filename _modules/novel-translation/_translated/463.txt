## Chapter 463: Proof (3)
“The character enters the witch’s hut.”
The witch’s hut, a place I had not visited since my ordeal with Misha. It was drastically different from my last visit.
The grassy field, once overflowing with wildflowers, and the verdant trees with their abundant foliage were gone.
“...Snow?”
A vast expanse of snow-covered land stretched before us. The snow-laden trees were bare and skeletal, with a single hut visible in the distance.
“Oh! Is this snow? Wow, it’s so cold!”
Ainar, upon seeing the snow, was genuinely thrilled, like a child. After all, it never snowed in Raphdonia. Except for Isce Rock, a few islands on the sixth floor, and some rifts, snow was rare. Even the Frost Canyon on the fifth floor was just a frozen field.
“Rookrook, come here!”
“...It’s Auyen Rookrobe, not Rookrook.”
“Aw, don't be so picky! That’s how you make friends! Anyway, come here!”
“...Ugh…?”
Amelia pointed out Ainar’s mistake, but Ainar persisted, dragging Auyen along to engage in a snowball fight.
“Ow! A, it hurts! Reins…!”
“...Yandell, are you just going to watch?”
Amelia, unable to contain her exasperation, reprimanded me for not stopping them immediately.  Well, let the barbarians have their snowball fight.
“Just leave them be. We’ll be checking on Erwen’s essence for a while.”
“Right, so you have no intention of resolving this.”
“No, that’s not what I meant… ”
“Alright, you go check on the essence. I’ll stay here.”
“...You’re not coming?”
“I’ve been thinking about putting you in your place anyway.”
With those cryptic words, Amelia darted towards Auyen. And then…
“Oh! Are you joining in too?”
“Yes.”
Having activated her [Self-Replication], she began relentlessly hurling snowballs at Ainar.
“Hahaha! Ha! Take that!”
Ainar, initially delighted by the added playmate, soon lost her smile.
“...Ugh, ow! What are you doing—!”
Amelia, not content with flinging Ainar to the snow, began rubbing her face into the snowdrift.
“Mmph…!”
“Here’s more of your favorite snow.”
“I, I’ve never seen a snowball fight like this—!”
“Why do you need rules in a fight?”
“Ugh, auuuugh! I won’t take this anymore!”
Ainar, finally mustering her immense strength, rose to her feet, but Amelia clung to her back, her legs binding Ainar’s arms. And then…
“What are you going to do if I don’t take it?”
She used her clones to exploit the unguarded moment and deliver a flurry of snowballs to Ainar’s face.
Thwack! Thwack! Thwack! Bam!
A precise barrage, as if Ainar was a target for a skilled pitcher.
“...Mister?”
“...Let’s just go.”
“Yes.”
After watching the three for a while, we turned our backs on them and headed toward the rear of the hut. The witch’s hut was the best training ground available, after all. It offered a private environment, and unlike city training grounds, there was no need for compensation for any damage.
“Erwen, are you done adapting?”
“Yes.”
“Do you notice any changes?”
“I’m not sure. It feels like my overall abilities have increased, but I don’t feel like there’s one specific ability that has significantly boosted.”
“There must be more, right?”
“...My head has been hurting since earlier.”
It wasn’t actual pain, but more like an unbearable pressure. Still, compared to before, the fact that she didn’t show it was a huge improvement.
“It’s because of the essence. Don’t worry too much.”
“Yes…? Because of the essence?”
Erwen’s eyes lit up with curiosity, and I began to explain slowly.
First, I had to talk about her stats.
[Chaos]
Increases your Negative Stat value by 200%. Your Negative Stat value is applied to all stats in proportion to its increase.
In the game, that’s all that was written in the base stats section. As always, it was my responsibility as the player to figure out the formula.
“Negative stats… are you referring to the stats that weaken me?”
Ah, I should’ve explained that first.
“That’s part of it, but not all of it.”
In [Dungeon and Stone], each stat had a coefficient, and that coefficient determined the increase in the values of the stats categorized as Physical, Mental, and Magical.
For example, Dexterity, which had a coefficient of 0.5, increased Magical stat by 0.5 for every +1 increase in the stat.
‘Resist Magic, with a coefficient of 3, is a high-value stat.’
But that’s not important now.
Most stats have coefficients of 0 or higher, but sometimes you can find stats with negative coefficients. I called those Negative Stats.
“For example, you have Impulse and Disbelief in your stats.”
These stats decreased your stats if they were positive. Conversely, if a stat with a coefficient of 0 or higher was negative, it was called “weakening stats,” as Erwen described.
Like Control -30 in [Rupture].
“Ah… ”
She seemed to understand the basic concept, so I quickly began calculating.
What was Erwen’s current Negative Stat value?
First, her Physical Resistance was -80 from ‘Evan’s essence.
Her Soul Regeneration was -40 from the ‘Littcannon’ essence, which I recommended.
Control was -30 in [Rupture].
Impulse and Disbelief were +30 each from ‘Kalban.’
‘Possession from the Metcrow essence has a coefficient of 0, so it doesn’t need to be included. Deprivation +40 was also erased before entering the dungeon this time… ’
Multiplying each stat by its individual coefficient and adding them together, then multiplying the result by the Chaos essence’s coefficient of 0.2, the calculation was complete.
The number appeared.
‘53.8.’
The amount by which all of Erwen’s stats would increase due to the Chaos essence.
Ah, is it all stats?
Stats that she didn’t possess, like Luck or Bone Density, wouldn’t increase.
‘…It’s already ridiculously efficient.’
I was a bit taken aback.
While the ‘Littcannon’ essence was something I recommended, the rest of the essences were chosen by Erwen.
‘If it’s decreased this much with Mental stats, it’s a bit dangerous… ’
Still, her mental fortitude has hardened significantly.
Proof of this was that she was being quite calm, even though the effects of the stat were greater than before.
‘But I’m still worried, so I should quickly replace it with another essence.’
Mental stats have low coefficients, making them difficult to properly utilize with the Chaos essence. Control is still the best, but Disbelief has a coefficient of only 0.6.
It would be far more efficient to decrease high-value stats with higher coefficients. Even with Resist Magic, reducing it by 50 would increase all stats by 30.
‘…Well, if you factor in the 200% increase in Negative stats, it would decrease by 100.’
Anyway, this unique characteristic makes it a good essence for dealers.
Tank essences rarely reduce damage and increase tankiness.
“I see…  You mentioned before that I should focus on enhancing my strengths… ”
Hmm, did I say that?
I couldn’t remember, but it was time to move on. Though not in the inn room where she usually demonstrated her abilities…
“Alright, use your abilities now!”
I had to do this.
***
The Chaos essence consisted of two skills:
One passive and one active.
That’s all.
Considering that guardian essences can have more than five active skills, this seemed lacking… 
But sometimes, one is better than a hundred.
(P) Chaos Circuit – All resources possessed by the character are combined into one. When all resources are consumed, you can use the power of Chaos.
The passive was quite unique.
Simply put, it’s a skill that combines resources like mana, nature power, soul power, and holy power into a single gauge…
This alone was enough to make it valuable.
It’s incredibly difficult to increase the nature power required for spirit magic.
‘That’s probably why Erwen ate the Ertes essence. She can use the passive to convert soul power into nature power.’
In that sense, I should erase that essence, which is useless now. The active, [Elemental Synthesis], isn’t bad, but it’s not an essence to keep until the end.
“I… If it’s abilities… ”
“Use [Concentrated Fire]. We’re trying to use up all your resources. Oh, summon a spirit too.”
“...If that’s the purpose, wouldn’t summoning Dicloe be better? It would be much faster.”
Oh, that’s true.
I urged her to summon it quickly, and Erwen, with a reluctant expression, activated her ultimate.
“Erwen Fornaci di Tersia summons [Dicloe, the Dark Spirit King].”
The black mass in the shape of a human figure ripped through space and appeared.
Dicloe, in accordance with Erwen’s request, unleashed a dark sphere towards the opposite side of the hut.
Boom, boom! Kaboom!
The barrier shattered as soon as the dark sphere touched it.
“Accumulated energy is depleted.”
Erwen’s resources were depleted about 30 seconds after she poured her energy into the attack. Before, using all her energy had limited her to 5 seconds.
‘I guess her mana pool has increased, as her duration is much longer now.’
Of course, that’s not the important part right now.
“An unknown energy envelops the empty vessel.”
The effect of [Chaos Circuit], which activates when all resources are consumed.
“All resources are not depleted for 1 minute.”
It’s called the perpetual motion mode.
“...It’s truly not deactivating?”
Erwen marveled as she watched Dicloe continuing to unleash its explosive power.
My own amazement wasn’t much different.
‘This much firepower for 1 minute and 30 seconds… ’
This isn’t even the limit of her firepower.
Her MP is unlimited.
I’ll let the Spirit King fight on its own, and I need to use some skills too.
“Erwen, now use [Concentrated Fire].”
I gave her an additional order, and Erwen, without any hesitation, grabbed her bow and drew the string.
Whoooosh!
The white light gathered at the tip of the arrow.
This skill, which had made a significant contribution in the fight against Riakis, was a skill I recommended she acquire as a reward from the royal family. Its effect was simple.
It consumes MP exponentially proportionate to the casting time…
Whoooosh!
But it also increases damage accordingly.
However, I usually prevented her from charging for more than 15 seconds. After that, MP consumption becomes excessive, and the damage increase decreases.
The cooldown was also about 60 seconds, so it was more advantageous to wait and shoot another arrow later.
But…
‘If MP is unlimited, it’s a different story.’
One second, two seconds, three seconds, four seconds…
As time passed, the energy concentrated at the arrowhead intensified.
How long did it take?
“Now.”
Erwen released her grip on the bowstring.
————!
The light shot out, bathing the world in white.
As before, there wasn’t even a scratch on the barrier.
But…
‘Right, this is it.’
I felt it instinctively.
Kaboom!
This instant firepower exceeded Dicloe’s.
***
“The unknown energy contained in the vessel is escaping.”
“All stats are temporarily reduced by 70%.”
***
Erwen collapsed into my arms, exhausted, but a frantic shout came from afar.
“B, Byorn—!! Where are you? Byorn!!”
It was Ainar, who had been playing with Amelia.
“W, what just happened! Is, is this a dimensional collapse? W, we might have to run away!!”
She acted as if she were a wild animal facing a disaster.
In a way, her innocence amused me.
“Don’t worry. It’s not a dimensional collapse.”
“R, really! I was so startled! The world suddenly flashed, and the entire ground shook!”
“Yeah, yeah. Calm down. It’s all right now.”
As I was trying to calm Ainar down, Amelia slipped to my side and asked.
“What was that… did Tersia do that?”
“Yes.”
“...Amazing. That’s what a stratum essence can do.”
“Don’t worry. I’ll get you one too later.”
I reassured her, but she scoffed, telling me not to treat her like a barbarian. But she clearly had some hope in her eyes.
“So, is it all over now?”
“Yeah, it’s all over.”
I haven’t tried the active, but I can’t verify it here anyway. I’ll have to experiment when we’re back in the city. It’s a very unusual skill.
“Erwen, can you walk?”
“No… I can’t.”
I was about to carry the exhausted Erwen, but someone else stepped forward before I could.
“Oh! Then I’ll carry her!”
Ainar, who had always been an excellent mount.
“Alright, get on!”
“... ”
“Come on?”
“...Yes, please… ”
With Ainar carrying Erwen, we headed towards the hut. Unlike the wintery exterior, the inside of the hut was unchanged.
The bookshelf, the table, the rug.
The small bed where my feet had slipped out when I lay down.
And.
Crackle, crackle.
The crackling fireplace.
“Yandell, what should we do now?”
“Go into the flames and it’s over.”
You’ll get the reward, the witch’s hut will close, and the character will be expelled to the forest.
“...Byorn.”
Ainar suddenly looked at me seriously.
“I’ve been thinking, but actually going into the flames doesn’t feel right.”
What the hell is this betrayal?
It wasn’t worth responding, so I just said I’d go first and crouched down, stepping into the flames.
Crackle!
A warmth that wasn’t hot at all.
“Your mental resistance stat permanently increases by +50.”
Okay, so my stats are good…
I closed my eyes and opened them again, but…
“Huh…?”
I froze in place when I opened my eyes. It wasn’t the witch’s forest, but a place I’d never seen before.
“Who are you?”
A girl with a pale complexion, looking like a ghost, glared at me.
