The Point of No Return (2)
A Noark approached, intending to inspect the cart.  However, he didn't seem genuinely committed to his duties; a certain unsavory air emanated from him, evident in his shifty appearance and voice.
“What is it? Why aren't you talking? Got something expensive in there?”
From his words, Rothmiller understood the man's goal was purely self-serving.
“……It only contains provisions.”
Hoping to dissuade him, Rothmiller offered this explanation, but the Noark only smirked.
“Provisions? You’ve got to be kidding me. Hey, pal?  Why so unfriendly? We’re all in this together, right?”
“What do you want?”
“Nothing much, just a little share. We're all suffering here, aren't we?  Huh?”
Rothmiller sighed inwardly.  How had he come to attract such a lowlife? Or perhaps, he should consider himself lucky it was only this kind of lowlife.
*Perhaps I can resolve this through conversation,* he thought.  Deciding on this approach, Rothmiller retrieved several high-value items from his [Treasure Trove].
“This is all I can offer.  I hope you’ll be satisfied with this.”
The items he offered were valuable assets, yet he didn't feel the slightest pang of regret.  After all, if this was enough to secure Bjorn Yandel, it would be an unbelievably cheap price to pay.  But…
“Oh, this valuable thing?”
Rothmiller's solution had one fatal flaw.  Retired from exploring and living a leisurely life teaching guides at the Barbarian Sanctuary, Rothmiller had momentarily forgotten: a beast's greed knows no bounds, and some beasts can even speak human language.  Therefore…
“But pal, I’ve been thinking…,”
Weakness invites attack.
“I think this is a little short.”
The Noark’s voice was laced with deepened greed and newfound confidence. The reason was simple; Rothmiller had readily given up valuables at the mere mention of a request, making him appear an easy target.
“What else do you have to give away this? Let me just take a quick look inside.”
The Noark assumed Rothmiller was hiding something of even greater value, given his willingness to part with these items.
“…Can't you hear me?  Let me look inside!”
The man, initially cautious and maintaining a distance, now advanced menacingly, determined to check the cart's contents by force if necessary.
“Must you see inside…?”
“Yes, if I must.”
The Noark's smug smile confirmed Rothmiller's fears. Rothmiller let out another long sigh.
*This is it, then.*
After a moment's hesitation, Rothmiller nodded.
“Very well, take a look. But as I said, there’s only food inside.”
“Bullshit.  Do you think I'm an idiot?  You just hid it well, that's all.”
The Noark sneered and approached the cart.  But the moment his greedy hand reached for the cloth covering it…
*Fwoosh!*
Rothmiller plunged the dagger he’d taken from his [Treasure Trove] deep into the man's throat.
“…Huh?”
The man’s eyes, even with the dagger embedded, showed no comprehension before he collapsed to the ground.
Rothmiller slowly surveyed his surroundings.
*Thump!*
Every Noark nearby was staring.  The commotion, culminating in a man's murder, was bound to attract attention.  But Rothmiller now understood how Noark operated – something he’d only heard about before, never experienced firsthand.
“…….”
“…….”
The surrounding Noarks showed no suspicion, no shock, no fear at the sight of a dead man. Their eyes only reflected intense greed.  And so, Rothmiller yelled at them.
“What the f*** are you looking at?”
“…….”
“If you don’t want to die, mind your own business!”
He shouted to project strength and deter them, but their lingering gazes remained fixed.
*Fwoosh!*
Rothmiller withdrew the dagger.  Then…
*Damn it, damn it, damn it, damn it…!*
Muttering curses, he decapitated the corpse with the efficiency of a butcher.  
*Slice, slice-*
Severing flesh and bone, he detached the head completely.  Rothmiller impaled it onto a spike on the left side of the cart.  Then…
“What, want to be on the right side?”
He addressed those still watching, and only then did the Noarks turn away, resuming their tasks.
*Clatter, clatter.*
The halted cart resumed its journey, this time at a faster pace.
*Clatter, clatter.*
As they traveled, Rothmiller finally understood why goblins and orcs adorned themselves with bone jewelry; it’s only unsettling to human eyes, a practical barbarity,  like this.
“…What’s that guy?”
“Pulling a cart, where’s he going? Should we ask?”
“Leave him alone.  He’s crazy.”
Those they passed ignored them, none suspecting that the cart, brazenly displaying a human head, contained the very Bjorn Yandel they sought.
*Clatter, clatter.*
The cart, moving with increased speed, finally stopped as the city walls loomed closer.
“Who are you? I don't think we share the same hobby, but that's interesting.”
A magician, staff in hand, blocked the cart.  He seemed unconcerned about the impaled head, and indeed, paid it little attention.
“So, what were you protecting, doing such a cute thing…,”
With those words, a fierce gust of wind swept in.
*Whoosh!*
The cloth covering the cart tore, revealing its contents to the world.  A tragic, yet inevitable, event.
“Bjorn Yandel…!”
“It’s Bjorn Yandel…!!!”
No one in this city didn't know his face.
***
Sven Parav, having miraculously escaped the Eastern Branch with the unexpected aid of a bear (?), emerged into the street.  Then…
*Boom!*
He shattered the well connected to the secret passage, eliminating any further pursuit worries.  Waiting at the well were familiar faces.
“Mr. Parav…!”
From Lilys Marone, her tears streaming as she embraced him, to the grateful refugees, the bear woman… and…
“Ha ha, it's a pleasure to meet you.  We haven’t met, have we? I’m Hikurod Murad. You could consider me your senior, in a way.”
A dwarf, with a hearty laugh, offered a hand for a handshake.
“Senior…?”
“Ah! Mr. Murad was a colleague of Mr. Yandel's!”
Marone’s explanation earned a nod from Sven Parav. He recalled hearing about such a person.
“Ah! The one who retired and started working in a smithy…,”
“That’s right! Though currently facing the prospect of losing my entire fortune!  Ha ha ha!!”
“It's a pleasure to meet you.  But what brings you here…?”
“It’s because of that friend over there. He’s determined to go alone to save his wife, but I can’t just let someone who can’t even find his way go alone.”
The dwarf gestured toward the bear woman's husband, finally allowing Sven Parav to greet him.
“I am Avman Urikfrit.”
“Ah…! I've heard of you! I'm Sven Parav.”
“Again, thank you. You saved my wife and child, didn't you?”
“It… was my duty.”
“Still, gratitude is gratitude. If you ever need help, don’t hesitate to ask. I'll drop everything and come to your aid.”
Despite the heartfelt thanks, Sven Parav felt a strange emotion.  Fate works in mysterious ways, doesn't it?  It was remarkable that the woman he saved was the wife of a former colleague of Yandel's.  In fact, considering it further, his own survival was directly linked to his decision to save her.
“But did Mr. Urikfrit and Mr. Murad ever work together?”
Marone asked, looking at the two.  The dwarf answered on their behalf.
“Ha ha ha, actually, not really.  I’m definitely his senior.”
“Really? You two seem very close…,”
“We just happened to become friends.  We both run businesses, we drink well together… and we share Yandel as a common denominator.”
“Ah, I see. I thought maybe you were on the same team, and I was mistaken.”
So that's how it is….  It wasn't unbelievable.  Even today, the connection of being "Yandel's colleagues" brought them together.
“Then who else was on the same team as Mr. Murad? I heard about Mr. Yandel, Mr. Kalstain, and the magician… but I don't think I've heard of the other one.”
“Ah, Brown Rothmiller, the team’s guide. He’s sort of this friend's direct senior. I heard he’s now teaching young warriors scouting techniques at the sanctuary…,”
“Ah, I see?”
“Come to think of it, it’s been a terribly long time since we last saw each other due to our busy schedules. Once this is over, I should go see him and have a drink.”
The dwarf smiled with a look of longing.

*Whoosh!*
A violent gust of wind revealed the cart's contents, simplifying the situation.
“…….”
“…….”
A moment of silence followed, including the mischievous magician who playfully unveiled the cart with a devilish grin.
“Bjorn Yandel…!”
“It’s Bjorn Yandel…!!!”
Time resumed its flow with the outcries.  But Rothmiller remained unfazed.  Though momentarily stunned, he quickly regained his composure and thought:
Sector 4 is currently occupied by the Noark.  However, this doesn't extend to the walls between Sector 4 and the Imperial City. The royal family controls the walls, the Noark maintaining a distance. The frontline isn't wide, except near the gate.
*If I can just get past this…*
Then it'll be alright.  The royal army will be watching from the walls, sending reinforcements through the gate to rescue Yandel.  So…
“…Sorry.”
With a brief apology, he…
*Thunk!*
…planted an arrow in the horse's rump.
“Hee-ha!!!”
The horse bolted forward in pain, and the magician, frozen in shock at the sight of Yandel, rolled aside, creating a temporary opening. The likelihood of reaching the walls through the enemy throng was slim, but…
*It's not zero.*
Rothmiller had learned from his time with the Barbarians: giving up without trying is the most foolish act.  Failure is better than resignation; even more so when there’s nothing left to lose.
*Thump!*
“Alright! Behel—radaaaaaaaa!!”
Rothmiller roared his battle cry, a familiar sound that now unexpectedly left his lips.  And at that moment…
“Behel—radaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!”
As if in response, a genuine battle cry echoed from somewhere. Recognizing the voice amidst the numerous Barbarian shouts, Rothmiller knew immediately:
Einar…?
