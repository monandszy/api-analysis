## Declaration of War (6)
A declaration of war, held back for over ten years. 
"......!!!"
"......!!!"
The mages, the citizens crowding the plaza, Mozlan's knights—all of them stared with wide eyes and gaping mouths. Each face reflected the same thought: "What did I just hear?" 
A non-mage, sharing the same bewildered expression, finally regained his composure and spoke. 
"......That's a weighty statement, even for a joke." 
A joke…
Well, it is common to first deny something shocking.
I didn’t answer, choosing to wait. The barbarians needed time to process it, too. 
About three seconds. 
"......W-war!"
The moment one warrior shouted, a storm of cries erupted. 
"W-war!!!"
"Everyone, grab your weapons!!!"
"Beh-ellaaaaaaaa!!!"
With over a thousand warriors bellowing in unison, the group of mages guarding the mage tower visibly faltered. I couldn't blame them.  Comparing the combat prowess of mages and warriors based on physique is absurd, but... 
Visual impact isn’t nonexistent. 
"Waaaaaaa!!!"
"U! U! U! U! U! U! U!"
These muscular barbarians, averaging 2.1 meters in height, stood as a formidable force, ready to charge. It’s a wonder anyone could remain unfazed.
“Old man,”
I took a large step toward the hundred-plus mages, my voice booming.
“Does it still sound like a joke?”
"......"
The non-mage stared blankly, as though lost in a dream.
Come on, I’m talking to you.
Thump.
Just as I was about to take another step, a Mozlan knight came rushing forward. 
"Lord Yandel! This, this won't do!"
He’d been captivated by the warriors’ maniacal energy but finally realized his role.
“War? Please, let’s calm down and discuss this. For the sake of the city, for the sake of the royal family……!”
His phrasing wasn't bad, considering his agitation. If he'd threatened me by implying the royal family wouldn't stand idly by, the situation would have become even more volatile.
“Discussion, huh…?”
"Yes, yes! Through dialogue, we can find a common ground! The mage tower and the barbarians are both pillars of this city!  For the sake of this city, I implore you……!"
Desperate to buy some time, the knight pleaded. I pretended to consider it before nodding.
“Alright.”
"Really?"
Right, the show of force is enough. I had absolutely no intention of storming the mage tower.
The city’s attention had been grabbed—more than enough. To charge in recklessly now would only make the barbarians the villains.
So, I continued…
“Egatil School's Lewin Pastolrum!”
I began calling out names one by one.
“Hulburnt School's  Rurendel Lungonerud! Altus School’s Odwick Bertef! Galatilir School's Elenel Dwainain!”
I mentioned 21 mage names clearly, one after another. The citizens, confused as they were, leaned in to hear my words. 
"Evabound School’s Tols Elin! Ornshstalt School’s Ukla Trazig! Wiltum School’s..."
When I finished, I turned to the non-mage.
“Old man, do you know who these are?”
"Of course. Most are talented young mages who will lead the next generation."
"Wrong." 
I shook my head, resolute.
“They are!  The mages who hired the rebels of the black market to steal a barbarian heart!”
Every war needs a justification.
"Ah! So that's why the barbarians…"
"They rescued slaves from the black market, right? Seems like they got some intel on the matter then!" 
The citizens observing finally grasped the reason for my visit. Some agreed, saying they would have protested too. 
But… 
‘If this was the end, I wouldn't have come in the first place.’
An appetizer is just an appetizer, never a main course. 
"Triten School's Master Rurendel Galinbarett."
I mentioned another name, my voice carrying a tone of certainty.
"Do you know who this one is?"
"......"
The non-mage, like someone receiving legal advice, remained silent.
As if that could change the truth.
"He's the one who hired the rebels of the black market. He wants my heart."
I dropped the bomb without a trace of hesitation.
"......!!!"
"......!!!"
This was entirely different from simply requesting a barbarian heart. 
The heart of a specific living person.
This request was practically an assassination contract. 
“Gullern, if this is true, not only must that mage be punished but also the mage tower.”
The Mozlan knight, who had been considering ways to stop me, changed his expression and threatened the old man. 
Mozlan isn't the knights of mages, after all. Mozlan itself was established to protect the authority of ‘nobles’.
“…There’s nothing confirmed yet. But I promise you, if something like that happened, we will thoroughly investigate under the tower's principles.”
The non-mage gave an ambiguous, slippery promise. Mozlan, unable to make a decision on the spot, backed down.
Of course, I had no need to do so.
"The mage tower is suspected of collaborating with the rebels of the black market. Therefore, your investigation is unreliable."
"......While I respect your judgment, this falls under our jurisdiction, and we have no evidence yet."
“Evidence, huh…?”
Right, I expected this response.
I revealed the time-honored barbarian secret.
"I will swear an oath."
"......?"
"I, Bjorn, son of Yandel, the barbarian clan leader and baron of the Rapdonia Kingdom, swear by the name of the royal family, and by the name of my clan! Every word I've spoken here is true!"
Just an empty oath, yet it was enough to convince every person gathered here. 
"To declare this in front of everyone, you must be confident in yourself."
“Would Lord Yandel lie?”
"You dirty mages! You dare to harm Lord Yandel!"
“Bring the criminals to justice!”
My heroic deeds. My reputation. The honest impression and positive image I'd cultivated within the city. And the justification I'd presented earlier—combined, they moved public opinion.
“Gullern, since the baron has spoken so plainly, you too must give an explanation.”
“I told you. We will investigate on our own.”
“That’s your right, but is that really necessary? Simply summon them, question them, and the matter is settled.”
"......"
"I guarantee, by this evening, Mozlan will have the authority to investigate the mages of the tower.  Conspiring to assassinate a noble is a serious crime.  Do you really want that?"
The moment Mozlan gains investigation authority, the tower will be thoroughly investigated by the power of the state. 
There will be plenty of shady things to be found.
But the non-mage's decision was rejection.
"I appreciate your concern, but we will handle that ourselves, so don't worry."
“You’re choosing a difficult path. Simply summoning them and questioning them would suffice.  Why can't you do the easy thing?"
"......"
The non-mage exercised his right to remain silent, and thus, public opinion was fully formed.
Silence, sometimes, is the most clear answer.
"You dirty tower scum! I knew it!"
"Do you dare to protect those who tried to harm Lord Yandel!"
The narrative was complete: the mage tower is undoubtedly an evil force, and the barbarians' anger is justified.
If that old man had agreed here to summon the mages I named, question them, and punish them, things wouldn’t have gone this far. But…
‘He probably thinks he can hush it up somehow by lobbying or something, as long as he gets through today.’
His response allowed me to take a step forward.
"Hear me, the proud citizens of this city who believe in fair chances and justice!"
The crowd that had been hurling insults at the tower fell silent, their mouths firmly shut.
A perfect moment to rally.
"The corrupt mages of the tower have no intention of admitting their guilt!  They’re busy covering for their own people! They can easily summon them from their labs and verify their innocence, yet they refuse to do so! Isn't that proof enough?  Isn't it?"
"Right!"
I reinforced the idea that we are the just side.
“They’ll probably destroy evidence once they return and brazenly present a fabricated result.  It’s as clear as day. We’ve witnessed this far too many times.  Isn’t it?"
"Right—!!"
I awakened the anger that every commoner carries within.
And at the same time. 
"But I will no longer stand idly by, powerless against such evil."
I spoke to them, that I will carry that long-standing anger and fight on their behalf. 
"I, Bjorn, son of Yandel!"
I swore by my name.
"I promise you, the justice of this city, founded under the law of the great Rapdonia, will be upheld once again!"
The moment I swore, the energized citizens erupted in a fervent roar. 
"Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!"
Okay, the atmosphere is heated enough now. 
With civilians mixed in, those mage bastards won't be able to respond properly. 
Right, the stage is set.
Therefore…….
"Whew..."
After a long exhale, I gathered my breath and roared with all my might.
"Chargeeeeeeee!"
After the war with the elves, I'd held back, time and time again.
It’s time to remind this city of the barbarian’s essence, a city that had forgotten what we are.
"Beh-ellaaaaaaaa!!!"
We don’t talk, we act.
***
Alex Hailo, assistant supervisor of the Third Mage Corps. 
He finished his daily report and stole a glance at his superior before leaving his office.
Despite the overwhelming workload, she still wore her uniform, impeccably pressed. 
Her blue eyes, though filled with fatigue, still held a sharp intelligence. 
Her small hand clutched a pen…
“What are you doing?  Not leaving?”
He flinched at his superior's words but quickly opened his mouth, offering an explanation.
"R-recently, she seems to be reading the newspapers quite often. You know, those ones."
“Ah, these?”
Indeed, his superior’s desk was piled high with newspapers from various companies. 
However, when she pointed at them, her usually confident demeanor faltered. 
As if she were ashamed. 
“Just a… hobby.  It gets stuffy, being stuck here all day. You have to know what's going on in the world.”
“…Right.”
Except, the newspapers on her desk always featured the same content. Or, to be precise, it wasn’t the content but the protagonist of the articles that remained constant.
“I heard things are quite lively these days. They say Lord Yandel got his name on the Stone of Honor.”
“Right. When we first met, it was just a joke, but now he really is a ‘great warrior’.”
Her voice held a touch of melancholy.
Alex tilted his head in confusion.
"Aren't you happy?  Lord Yandel is your former comrade, isn't he?"
“A former comrade… you see…….”
“Ah…….”
Realizing his slip-up, Alex stopped talking. He watched his superior stare at the newspaper with a distant look in her eyes, feeling an inexplicable sense of unease. 
He’s just an incompetent subordinate, a mere number one. 
He could never conjure the expression she wore.
"......"
"......"
Her gaze drifted towards the window as she reminisced, her chin resting on her hand. Alex stared at the profile of his superior, lost in his thoughts.
How much time passed like that?
“B-but, Supervisor!  Urgent deployment order……!”
A corps member burst through the office door.
Her superior, as if regaining her senses, immediately stood up, grabbing her coat.
She had to act fast.
The Third Mage Corps is not like the city’s police or Mozlan.  An urgent deployment order from the royal family’s military?
It meant something beyond a simple riot was happening in the city.
“Tell me more.”
She headed towards the training ground where the assembly order was issued, questioning the subordinate about various details.  She quickly grasped the situation. It was clear enough to be summarized in a single sentence.
Baron Yandel is heading towards the mage tower, leading his clan members.
“There’s no clash yet, but reports indicate that the path they’re taking leads directly to the mage tower.”
“Why? There must be a reason for him to do this.”
“We’re investigating.  However, due to the movement of a force over a thousand strong, it seems like the city’s police have also requested military assistance.”
“I see.”
Being a military group, within minutes of the emergency mobilization order, all the corps’ troops gathered in the training ground. They immediately boarded carriages and headed towards the military platform.
“Supervisor, I think this is a big deal. It seems like our corps isn't the only one receiving deployment orders.”
Countless military carriages lined the path leading to the platform, in addition to their own.
However, her superior didn’t answer Alex.
She simply gnawed at her nails, her eyes filled with worry. 
“That man… what kind of trouble is he causing now…?”
Alex tried to offer words of reassurance, focusing on the positive.
Baron Yandel is a smart man. 
And as someone with a lot to lose, it’s probably just a show of force at the mage tower. 
Don’t worry too much. 
He wasn’t just offering comfort, he was speaking from his heart. But his superior's worried expression didn’t ease. 
"......Alex. You seem to be mistaken. What I’m worried about right now isn’t Baron Yandel.”
“Yes…? B-but, even if it's the mage tower, right?”
Alex couldn't understand. 
He, too, was a mage tower graduate, and he knew better than anyone the tower's power and authority.
Why was she so worried?
As he contemplated this, his superior’s voice rang out.
“Do you remember what happened to the Explorers’ Guild because of that man?”
“Ah, the false accusation incident?”
"Yes.  A large-scale escape occurred, and the entire guild branch was destroyed.  The branch leader was implicated and lost the next election.”
"But… the guild and the mage tower are different."
The guild, maybe.  
But compared to the entire mage tower, the guild is nothing more than a small store.
However... 
“I... also thought so once. That the guild and the tower are different. That they wouldn't be swayed by a single barbarian.”
“But now… you’re saying they are?”
Raven nodded without a moment’s hesitation.
“Yes. He's not just a barbarian anymore. When he single-handedly turned things upside down, he was just a barbarian who’d been an adult for two months. But what about now?”
Alex was speechless.
Years had passed since then, and he had become the leader of his race and a baron of a kingdom.
"More importantly… I know him well."
"......?"
"Alex, trust me. If he did it, no matter how reckless it seems, it won’t be reckless.”
Of course, Alex still didn't understand. But he held back from arguing, knowing that constantly disagreeing with his superior was inappropriate.
Click-clack, click-clack.
As the carriage sped down the road, they reached the military platform.
Crackle, crackle!
A new message arrived via message stone.
[Clash, clash situation. Baron Yandel and the barbarian warriors have entered the mage tower!  Urgent assistance is required!]
Even with that shocking report, her superior only let out a long sigh. 
As if she’d been expecting it.
