## Chapter 546: Ghost (4)
The day after my visit to the Community.
Waking up with a heavy sense of fatigue, I began my daily routine. In simpler terms, I had breakfast.
“Alright, everyone, breakfast is served!”
It was a stark contrast to the chaotic days when three groups were haphazardly working together. Even in daily life, outside of battles, we had our designated roles.  Now, four members took turns handling the cooking and meal preparation for everyone.  Oh, by the way, Misha is the head of the meal crew. 
“What do you think? Does it taste alright? I made it a little less salty this morning, since it's breakfast.”
“It's fine, except for the lack of meat.”
“Ah… meat… .”
“Just kidding. We have to save meat. You never know.”
Speaking of saving, after breakfast, I went to check the remaining food with Vercil, who was in charge of supplies.
“We have enough for sixty-one days for thirty-eight people. If we reduce the rations, we can stretch it for another four days.”
“Forget it. What are we supposed to fight with if we cut back even more?”
Our current food supply was about two months’ worth. In fact, we only had this much thanks to the Armin Expedition team’s ample supplies. The Hecks Clan, who lost their ship and were stranded, had already run out of food, while we had brought enough for seven people for four months.
‘Day 86…’
If this were a normal dungeon, it would be ten days since the seventh floor closed. But we're still trapped inside. And the problem is…
‘At this rate, I can't guarantee we’ll escape even by day 200.’
Of course, I wasn’t overly worried about food. We were expecting more new recruits soon, and if absolutely necessary, we could always use a ‘Distortion’ spell on monsters and hunt them like we did in Ice Rock. 
“Anyway, I’ve said it before. If anyone needs anything, don't hold back, except for food.”
“We already are.  Actually, there’s something else… .”
“And?”
“………Never mind.  I'll tell you when I’m more sure.”
I had a hunch about what she was trying to say. That there was an Evil Spirit spy hiding within our expedition team. But revealing that would mean also revealing she was an Evil Spirit.
“Okay?  Then I’ll go.”
“Yes.”
After the supply check, I found Amelia and asked if anything had happened during the night. After all, she was the leader of the guard.
“Nothing special.”
It always ended the same way, but it was a role that couldn’t be left out. In the dungeon, you never know when an external enemy might appear…
And you can’t let your guard down inside, either.
You never know what unexpected event might unfold, so you always have to be careful.  Like this.
“However, I think the Hecks Clan warrior Bilkers is under a lot of stress. He hasn’t been sleeping well lately.”
The expedition’s guard was essentially a watchdog, informing me daily about everything that happened during the night.  By the way, there are six guards in total, with the ex-royal investigator acting as Amelia’s right hand.
“Alright. I’ll talk to him later.”
“Then I won’t worry about him too much.”
“Huh?”
“You’re like an idol to warriors.  And that guy seemed to respect you a lot, so he should feel better.”
After my morning conversation with Amelia, I went to visit the three mages from the Armin Expedition team.
“Emily told me you worked all night on your research. Did you make any progress?”
The three of them acted as our expedition’s research team.  Investigating monster corpses, essences, library summoning books, summoning altars, monster-infested stone gates…
Anything we saw or found in this dungeon was their responsibility.
“Um… not really progress, as such…”
“We did find some unusual readings in the Hipra-Mantra blood sample… .”
“If you just give us a little more time and resources… .”
For some reason, they seemed to tremble and look at me nervously whenever I asked about their progress. I reassured them that I wasn’t pressuring them, but they didn’t change their attitude.
A habit from their time at the Magic Tower?
“Hehe, Baron, aren’t you the head of the expedition?”
“Even so… It’s hard for us to relax.”
“Of course, you can’t get results if you’re too complacent.”
Well, I couldn’t really argue with that.
Anyway, with the research team’s report, my morning routine was complete.
“Okay, everyone, if you’re done digesting, go back to your stations!”
Time to get back to work.  Had a good meal and digested it well, right?
“I’m about to summon monsters!”
Time to get back to my main job.
***
After my morning routine, the usual pattern is simple. I pile up the books I’ve collected the previous evening and start the endless hunt.
Swoosh-swoosh-swoosh-!
I pull out magic stones and, when an essence appears, stop summoning for a moment to check what kind of essence it is.  Oh, we don’t need to rely on witness testimonies anymore.  We have recording crystals installed, so everything in the hunting grounds is being recorded.
“That's a Katan-da essence.”
“A Katan-da Green Essence, it’s [Omen of Calamity], right, Baron?”
“Not for us.”
“Alright.  Is anyone else interested in it?”
Once the essence is identified, I have the first choice. If I refuse, it goes to the next person in line. And if nobody wants it, it’s discarded.
“Isn’t it strange?  It’s a Rank 4 essence, but nobody takes it.”
“Sometimes, even Rank 3 essences are discarded.  There’s nothing strange about it.”
“If we wait a little longer, we might find a more suitable essence.  There's no rush.”
“Haha, looking at the essence before you and considering the future. If you told someone outside about this, they wouldn’t believe you.”
“Not even putting it in a vial, what a waste. That’s a lot of money… .”
“The Baron said to conserve vials.  I think it’s a wise choice.”
Surprisingly, the explorers were happy when essences were discarded.  The hunt would stop until the essence naturally vanished.
Well, it doesn’t mean we stop completely.
“What are you all doing?  Replenish the summoning books we used until the essence disappears!”
I used every spare moment, including those tiny gaps.  I sent all the members to the bookshelves to fetch summoning books, and when there were plenty, I quickly cooked up a meal.
And as a result of all this hard work…
‘Ten days, I wonder?’
Ten days since I arrived at the library and started hunting. It was the first time I’d gotten a proper reward.
“…Baron?”
“We’ll take this one.”
I had passed over dozens of essences before finally obtaining this one.
‘Speer-dipher.’
A Rank 3 monster found in a specific area of the Deep Sea on the sixth floor, with an extremely low chance of encountering it when diving deep. 
Of course, it has a designated owner.
“Ainar.”
“Oh! You’re right!!”
Immediately, Ainar, who had been watching from nearby with her eyes darting around, came running to me.  I guess she was anticipating this, being a spear user.
But, it would be boring to just give it to her.
“Wait.”
“Ugh… !  No, why should I wait!  If you’re going to give it to me anyway—.”
“Shush.”
“… .”
Of course, I was going to do this.
“Take it.”
“Woohoo!”
Finally given permission, Ainar lunged at the essence. What is this?  She's lost her fighting spirit, but her greed remains?
「Ainar Fnellin’s soul absorbs [Speer-dipher essence].」
The essence's light seeped into Ainar’s body, and after enjoying the afterglow, she opened her eyes and shouted like someone addicted to drugs.
“What is this!  This is crazy!  I haven’t felt this strong in ages…!!”
Well, that’s to be expected.
All of her basic stats are maxed out in physical attributes.
Of course, what matters isn’t stats, but skills.
(P)  **Discrimination** — When attacking non-allied targets, damage increases proportionally to combat time. The opposite effect applies to allied targets.
A passive skill perfect for Ainar’s ‘Assassin’ mark.
And…
(A)  **Trident** — When attacking using a spear, the same damage is inflicted on two nearby enemies.
An active skill with no cooldown and low MP consumption.
Of course, it's not as overpowered as other skills…
Skills with such OP properties always create a broken character.
[Trident] was meant to replace [Repeated Slash] and become Ainar’s basic attack.
‘Okay, Ainar’s done…’
We still have plenty of essences to switch, but she’s out of slots, so we’ll have to deal with that once we get back to the city.
So, what remains…
‘One for me, one for Erwen, and two for Amelia…’
These are the ones we can use immediately.  If we store them in vials beforehand, we’ll have even more.
After all, it’s much better to be able to erase essences and change our setups right after arriving in the city.
And, in that sense,
‘…Maybe I should look for materials for marks.’
The 8th stage material for the Undying Mark is dropped by three types of Rank 3 monsters.
Of course, there are other materials…
‘But those can be bought in the city.’
Unlike lower-tier materials, you can’t just buy Rank 3 materials, even with money.
Even the 7th stage material, the Soul of the Dead, was like that.
It was dropped by the Rank 4 monster, Lich, but there was only one item listed in the Central Marketplace.  That’s why I spent all my money on that single item, because I didn’t know when I’d be able to get another one…
「Ainar Fnellin casts [Trident].」
As Ainar was testing out the new essence’s abilities and adapting to her enhanced body…
“Captain!!”
The only non-combatant among the thirty-eight.  Awyen Lokrob, the navigator, rushed to me, clutching a large summoning book.
“I… I found it… !  I… I finally found it!”
“Found what?  Calm down and tell me… .”
“This book summons Bellarios!”
Hearing this, I closed my eyes and let out a long breath.
“Whew… .”
So, it finally appeared.
***
Bellarios.
A Rank 3 monster that resembles an Eastern dragon. It appears in the Dragon Mountains, located in the heart of the Dark Continent.
But, with that place becoming a war zone, it became a monster you could hunt, even though nobody had successfully slain one yet.
“Vercil, gather everyone, even those who are in the bookshelves.”
I had been waiting for this moment ever since I arrived in the library, so I hurried to gather everyone and briefed them on Bellarios.
But, maybe she was a little dissatisfied with that.
“Um… .”
Someone cautiously raised their hand among the explorers who were intently listening to my lecture.
“What is it, Ainar?  Hungry?”
“No, it’s not that…  I haven’t even adapted to my new essence… .”
“So?”
I really had no idea what she was trying to say.
“Where in the world would you find better practice than real combat?”
This was a sentiment all Barbarian warriors would understand.
But…
“That… I… I’d rather practice than actually fight.  It’s more efficient, right?  Like, really efficient.”
Ah, right.
That damn fighting spirit.
“Can't you just practice while we fight?”
She's so desperate to avoid combat that she’ll grab any excuse.
Of course, my answer was predetermined.
“No.  You’re fighting this time, too.”
“…Alright.”
Seeing her dejected expression makes me feel like a bad person, and it softens my heart, but I try to sever my feelings as much as I can.
Erwen approached me and whispered softly.
“Sir, it's a Rank 3, and it's just two, not three.  Don’t you think we can handle it ourselves?”
I don’t know when she became close enough to offer support from behind, but she wasn't wrong.
Ainar not participating in the battle?
It wouldn’t matter much in this specific fight.
But…
‘The problem is everyone else seeing that.’
Even if they are from the same clan, showing leniency and special treatment in this kind of situation will inevitably lead to resentment.
Even if it doesn’t show outwardly.
So, in other words…
“I’ve already made my decision.  Don't question it.”
“…Yes, sorry.”
I firmly rejected Erwen’s plea and continued with the briefing. When I was certain everyone had grasped the enemy's information, I placed the summoning book on the altar.
And…
Drrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.
The stone gate, which had opened and closed countless times today, swung open, revealing two monsters.
Roar-roar-roar-!
A goat-head walking towards us, carrying a hammer, with a sack of blazing red liquid strapped to its back.
‘Helsmith.’
The original owner of the essence of the chieftain, nicknamed the Warrior of Flame.
And…
‘Bellarios.’
I subconsciously licked my lips, seeing its smooth scales.
「Bellarios casts [Scales of Greed].」
「Bellarios is immune to all magic damage.」
Give it to me.
