## Chapter 542: Verdant Glaive (4)
No. 7, the Verdant Glaive of Millaryell. This Numbers item, also a graduating weapon for the Spear class, possesses a well-balanced blend of damage and tanking capabilities. Our initial research into Spear Barbarians was largely driven by the impressive survivability this weapon offered.
"But even with that, it would end up being just another berserker-like build."
Of course, that doesn't make the Berserker class bad. It's a viable choice if the team has a main tank of similar strength, and can even serve as a secondary tank in crisis situations.  However...
"Hmm..."
No matter how much I thought about it, this weapon felt ambiguous.
"Everyone, tidy up around you!"
"Yes?"
"We're leaving soon!"
"Ah, yes, yes...right away!"
Everyone seemed curious about who would inherit this weapon, but we decided to first set sail and leave the island, continuing our deliberation. It wasn't a decision to be made lightly.
"Setting sail!"
The ship, carrying us all, soon cut through the silver waves. 
How much time had passed?
"Mister! Look over there!"
From the shrinking island's heart, a colossal giant rose to its feet, letting out a ferocious roar, its gaze fixed on us.
[ROOOOAAAARRR!]
...Why does that thing do that every time we leave?
***
We continued our in-depth contemplation, the destination, the library island, looming before us. 
To whom should we give this weapon?
"Ah, we met eyes again."
While casually scanning my surroundings, hoping for some sort of answer, my gaze crossed paths with a man's. He was a spearman from the Hex Clan. As the sole spear wielder among so many, he hadn't dared to voice it, but I could tell he was harboring a secret hope - a hope that he might be chosen.
Therefore...
Whirl!
I quickly averted my gaze. 
He should aspire for something worthy of his aspiration. This weapon belongs to the Clan Anabad. It's already decided. Therefore, my only remaining concern is who among our clan members should wield it.
"First, Erwin and Versil are out of the question."
Amelia and Misha are the same. Misha has already committed to a dual-wielding frost build, and Amelia's affinity lies in aura, making her unsuitable for a spear.
As for Auyeon, she's not a combat class in the first place.
By process of elimination, the only one left is Ainar.
"Huh? You want to try it?"
Upon catching my eye, Ainar smiled brightly and offered me a piece of jerky she was holding, a treasured snack she had been carefully savoring. I accepted it, taking a bite and chewing while my thoughts continued.
"......She's the one who's most likely to fully utilize the spear's capabilities, right?"
[Increases natural regeneration proportionate to combat duration.]
[All healing effects are tripled.]
These two options pair perfectly with the "Slaughterer" inscription's "Combat Learning" and "Predation." 
Combined with skills like "Wings of Greed" and "Crouch," which boost natural regeneration, she would achieve monstrous recovery speeds. 
The Spear Barbarian I raised in the past also adopted the "Slaughterer" inscription, acquiring skills with similar effects.
However, the problem here is...
"The moment she grabs the spear, she'll have to abandon several skills."
First, there's the level 4 skill, "Repeated Cut."
While it's not impossible to use it with a spear, she wouldn't be able to take advantage of the increased penetration damage.
The same applies to "Wild Control," which transforms conditional activation effects into "Cutting Power," rendering it useless.
"If she doesn't use 'Repeated Cut,' 'Mark of Explosion' becomes meaningless, and then the entire build becomes a skill-less mess without 'Slick Grease,' 'Residual Heat,' or anything."
Essentially, the moment she grasps the spear, she'll have to completely overhaul her skillset – a disaster. 
But...
"Wait, she's only got level 4 or lower skills, besides Hiphramaent?"
Suddenly, that thought occurred to me.
"What if we just re-work the entire build?"
"Dungeon & Stone" is a game focused on character development. Crafting a perfect final build is crucial, but designing the character's growth towards that final build is even more vital. Without preparing multiple items and substitute essences for each stage, reaching the final build becomes impossible. 
It's essential to continuously raise the value of skills while retaining the character's original concept.
Creak, creak, creak.
"The reason I made 'Repeated Cut' a core skill for Ainar was for that exact reason. It's a rare level 4 skill obtained early on. We can set up an essence configuration utilizing it, and then replace it later with a superior skill."
But...
"...It's not entirely impossible."
I've already maxed out my own growth.
Erwin has ascended to a unique position through the Consumption Essence, and Misha has returned after training with Baekho, achieving phenomenal growth.
As for Amelia, she was always incredibly powerful.
To be brutally honest, the hunt would not be hindered at all if Ainar were absent right now. In other words, she can be power-leveled.
"Technically, it's power-leveling, but using a spear wouldn't significantly reduce her combat strength."
A single Numbers item. A graduating weapon without substitutes. The effects it grants are powerful enough to compensate for abandoning a few skills, especially considering they're level 4 or lower.
Penetration damage 1,200%. All spear damage tripled. Top-tier penetration bonus. These three options alone would arguably increase her single-target damage compared to using a sword, and the various regeneration enhancements would add even greater stability.
So, the question now is…
"Will she accept it?"
Let's see if she's even willing to consider it. I've got nothing to lose anyway. 
Let's do it the Barbarian way.
"Ainar."
I casually approach her, keeping my tone light.
"Ever thought about using a spear instead of a sword?"
"...Spear?"
Ainar stops chewing her jerky and stares at me, her expression unreadable.
Ah, another dead end? 
Regardless of personal preference, Barbarians dislike weapons like these, viewing them as cowardly.
"Oh! If you're talking about that spear, I want it! Give it to me!"
...Huh? What?
What's with this response?
"I'm just saying this in case you misunderstood. You're going to be using a spear from now on, forever. And you'll be changing all your essences."
"If I have to...will that include the Semura Essence?"
The Semura Essence refers to "Repeated Cut." It's a skill passed down to Ainar through "Soul Succession," a technique her elder, who she revered like a master, performed before his death.
"Yes, that one too."
"...Is that so..."
Ainar's eyes softened, a hint of longing in them.
But her response didn't take long.
"If I wish, I'll consider it carefully and—"
"Okay, I'll switch to a spear."
"...Huh?"
She's talking about completely overhauling her entire build, and she decides in less than a minute?
"Is this...a true Barbarian...?"
This is a level I can't even fathom.
However, I doubt Ainar made this decision without any thought.
"Why are you so surprised? All the essences I've got now were recommended by you."
"Uh...that's true, isn't it?"
"Thanks to you, I've gained immeasurable fame. I've gained the strength to fight unimaginable foes, and I was able to protect my comrades with that strength."
Ainar gazed at me intently, her voice low.
"That's why I trust you."
"..."
"You wouldn't do anything to harm me, would you?"
I understand. It wasn't just a reckless decision, but rather a complete trust in me, allowing her to move forward without any doubt.
"Can I do that?"
The thought of an unbearable trust suddenly crossed my mind.
"And more than anything..."
Ainar avoided my gaze. Or rather, she turned her gaze away from me, staring elsewhere.
And with a ravenous glint in her eyes.
"...Th, that spear is fine! Isn't it huge!"
"Ah..."
"I think it's 1.5 times bigger than my greatsword!"
I was speechless.
Like how ravens are instinctively drawn to shiny objects, Barbarians have a penchant for all things large.
"It's also sparkly and shiny!"
That's a bonus.
"And it seems like all the winged ones use spears!"
I see...there were many reasons for you too.
***
Ainar immediately began to familiarize herself with the spear, having changed her class to Spearwoman.
Swinging through the air, extending forward to gauge distance, and so on.
Initially, she seemed unsure how to hold it properly, but her posture stabilized at an unbelievably rapid pace.
"Hu hu, now it's starting to look like my old stance!"
"Old stance?"
"Don't you remember? When we were young, we learned to use all kinds of weapons!"
"Ah, that...yeah, we did..."
Oh, why bring up the past now?
As usual, I cut her off with a one-word answer, but unfortunately, Ainar was already lost in her memories.
"Come to think of it, it's quite a coincidence. I heard that my mother and my sister also used spears."
Thankfully, it was a topic I could answer naturally. 
I hadn't heard about her using a spear before, but I had talked about Ainar's sister previously.
Ainar, the second daughter of the Pnelin clan. Ainar has a sister. 
Or rather, she had a sister.
"Uh? You had a sister?"
Erwin, who also has a sister, asked with a curious expression, prompting Ainar to shrug her shoulders.
"Ah, did I never tell you? She was four years older. She became an explorer first, telling me stories and teaching me skills. She used to tease me a lot, hu hu hu..."
"..."
Erwin tilted her head, baffled by Ainar's nostalgic recollection, but it was just a cultural difference between their species.
"So, how was your sister? Was she famous?"
"She died. Two years before my coming-of-age ceremony."
"Oh...I, I'm sorry..."
Erwin apologized, seeming to have struck a nerve.
But Ainar remained unfazed.
"Huh? Why are you apologizing? It's not like your fault that my sister died."
"But...it must be a sad memory for you."
"Sad memory? What's that supposed to mean? I only have good memories of her. Of course, I miss her a little now, but whenever I think of her, I always feel happy."
Erwin was speechless for a moment.
"How...is that even possible? I still...feel like my heart is going to burst whenever I think of my sister."
Her voice was raised, almost accusatory, but thankfully, Ainar didn't mind such trifles. She just tilted her head innocently.
"Why, you ask? I don't really have an answer for that."
"..."
"Well, wouldn't you rather be laughing than being gloomy? My sister would definitely feel the same way!"
Such a typical Barbarian response.
But Erwin remained silent, only staring at Ainar for a long time before turning away and climbing to the observation deck.
"Whew...finally got some space to breathe."
I let out a long breath I'd been holding, prompting Ainar to raise an eyebrow, perplexed.
"...Did I do something wrong?"
"Nothing. Just keep doing what you were doing. We'll be going straight into combat once we reach the island."
"Oh! Okay!"
I returned Ainar to her automatic training mode, momentarily paused, and headed towards the helm of the ship. After confirming the estimated arrival time with Auyeon, I leaned against a pillar and closed my eyes.
"The grunts will handle themselves, and if something tough shows up, they'll wake me up."
How long did I sleep?
Awakening, I grabbed my canteen and searched for Ainar. I was curious to see how she was progressing.
"Huh?"
Ainar was resting on the deck, her training abandoned. She was with Erwin.
"What's up?"
I was secretly worried, given their proximity, but their conversation was surprisingly normal.
"Ha ha, so you also have a younger sister, huh? What's she like? Is she an explorer?"
"No, not yet. She'll be having her coming-of-age ceremony in two years. I'm a little worried."
"If you're worried, just teach her things yourself."
"It's...not that simple."
"Huh? Ah, you mean because you're stuck here?"
"No, it's not that. It's just...since my sister died...and my dad suddenly disappeared, we haven't been very close."
"Ah, I see. Yeah, I guess you were constantly on the battlefield seeking revenge. It's all your fault then!"
Ainar's matter-of-fact response made me flinch, but surprisingly, Erwin calmly agreed.
"It is my fault...yes. It's all my fault."
"Ha ha, I knew it. Then just do better from now on, wouldn't you?"
"But I think it's already too late. My sister hates and resents me."
"Did she say that herself?"
"No, not exactly, but—"
"Don't think too much. Resentment? She's family. That wouldn't happen. She probably also wants things to go back to how they were between the two of you."
"Do you think so...?"
It's strange to see a Fairy receiving serious life advice from a Barbarian, an arch-nemesis.
But at the same time, the scene made sense.
"Of course, she does! Trust me on this!"
I finally understood how Ainar could easily become friends with everyone.
***
76 days into the dungeon. We finally reached the library island, leaving the Giant Isle behind.
Our task here is endless farming.
"Bellarios is Bellarios, but I hope some good essences drop for Ainar."
With that hope in my heart, we entered the building and descended a long staircase. Then...
"Yandel, someone's below."
"One person. No one else."
"He's crouched down, looks like he's sleeping..."
"What should we do?"
Amelia and Erwin conveyed unexpected news.
Someone was here before us.
"Who is it?"
The first candidate that popped into my head was...the clan that entered the dungeon's first floor with the Armin Exploration Team from the previous round. Their name was...
"...Could it be someone from the Ain Imperial Clan?"
Ah, that's right.
"But the number is strange. One person? Where did all the others go...?"
Muell frowned, lost in thought, but I wasn't particularly curious. Or rather, I didn't have time for it.
"Let's just ask him."
No matter how much we speculate, it's always better to hear it from the horse's mouth.
I immediately descended the stairs.
BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!
The loud noise we made must have roused the mysterious guest. He was no longer sleeping but awkwardly stood up as we reached the bottom.
"Oh...! You, Baron?!"
The man was startled upon seeing me. 
To be honest, I was equally surprised.
Because...
"...Matherkin Ligriam."
He was the captain of the Silver Lion Clan, who we last saw on the village island and then disappeared.
