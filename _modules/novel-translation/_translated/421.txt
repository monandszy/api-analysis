## Chapter 421: Ice-Cold (1)
**Dragon's Breath: Silence of the Soul.**
A devastatingly overpowered skill that burns the MP of all characters within its range, forcing them into a state of "Soul Exhaustion." However, it wasn't without its weaknesses. 
I recalled an old Dragonkin elder's advice about its weaknesses: it could only drain up to 40% of a character's maximum MP. In simpler terms, as long as a character maintained more than 40% of their maximum MP, they wouldn't reach Soul Exhaustion, even if their MP dropped to zero.
"That's probably why he's been saving it all this time."
My body had recovered after receiving healing from the priest following my escape from the Ice Eye, but my MP was a different story. I had already used a significant portion of my MP, exceeding half, during the battles with these goons. I had used [Gigantification] and spammed [Swing] numerous times.
That was why I had deliberately provoked him.
"I'm curious, when will you finally come? Will death be the only salvation when you reach your limit?"
[...Creak.]
If I continued at this rate, my MP would run out. While I did have [Soul Dive], it had a cooldown. Using it once would mean losing the ability to counter Dragon's Breath.
Therefore, I had to force him to use it quickly. 
And the result was...
"K-K-Cough! K-K-Cough! R-R-Roar…!"
The Dragon Slayer fell into a state of combat incapability. He had seemed to struggle every time he used Dragon's Breath in Larcaz's Labyrinth, but I didn't expect him to be this vulnerable. 
An unexpected bonus.
"Character has used [Soul Dive]."
"Character has used [Gigantification]."
On the other hand, I had recovered my depleted MP, even after dodging their finishing moves.
"H-How…?!"
I couldn't resist capturing that priceless expression for posterity.
"Behel—RAAAAHHHHH!"
It felt as if the ancestor god's energy was surging throughout my body.
"Manuare Pepeless has used [Iron Fist]."
The bald head's brutal punch came flying toward me, but I caught it with a smile.
So, it seems Dragon's Breath doesn't affect them.
"Of course. If he'd been planning to use Dragon's Breath, he would've formed a pact with the front-liners first."
The bald head, along with the other front-line Noarck forces, wasn't affected by Silence of the Soul. The backline seemed to be outside the Dragon's Breath range.
"Thankfully, our team is out of range too."
That was also why I had sent the expedition's front-line troops back. It was not just a secondary line of defense against the raiding party, but also a necessity to protect them from Dragon's Breath.
"He didn't use Dragon's Breath inside, even though it was risky. He must've thought he could finish everything by taking me out first. He probably also calculated that our team would be in danger if we fell into a combat-incapable state."
Thinking about it now, it was quite amusing.
"Yes, you've always forced me to make sacrifices."
Sacrifices like this? If he was determined to cut off an arm, he should've been prepared to sever his entire shoulder blade.  But he carelessly threw away his cards like this. 
If he'd truly been prepared to sacrifice himself, it would've become a significant variable for us.
"A good thing. But…."
While relief washed over me, I felt a sense of injustice. Or rather, emptiness.
"Just… this... pathetic excuse for a Dragon Slayer? Dwarki…."
An officer of Orcullis? A notorious criminal who killed an ancient dragon?
Ultimately, his essence hadn't changed. He was far less impressive than that one.
"Character has used [Eye of the Storm]."
"The power of the Transcendent grants access to the skill's innate abilities."
I used the grab skill to pull the Dragon Slayer toward me. The Dragon Slayer coughed up blood, dragged by the strong gale, weak and helpless.
Kwang-!
The moment my hammer struck, his left shoulder shattered.
"AAAAARGH…!"
"Damn, I aimed for the head. He dodged at the last moment."
Well, another chance will come.
Leaving behind my disappointment, I blocked the bald head rushing in to save the Dragon Slayer. 
He wasn't the only one.
"Mike Roymers has used [Ground-Leveling]."
"Reduces allied damage taken within a certain radius by half, taking the remaining half instead."
A blunt weapon user close to a tank.
"Ria Andes has used [Wave of Fire]."
"Temporarily increases all fire damage significantly, gaining additional effects as you get closer to the target."
An unusual melee-type mage.
These three seemed to be well-coordinated. They moved more tightly together, annoying me even more after the Dragon Slayer’s retreat.
"Kael Elbad Jeneker has used [Thorns of the Earth's End]."
And, of course, there was the occasional ranged attack from the backline.
I lacked armor, so their attacks pierced and cut through my body. But…
"Royta Mamender has used [Advanced Healing]."
"Benjamin Ormon has used [Advanced Healing]."
The priests were showering me with buffs, and on top of that, they were constantly healing me. 
They couldn't push me back.
"Kelbus Iron has used 4th-Grade Black Magic [Mark of Evil]."
"Reduces all regeneration effects on the character."
"Benjamin Ormon has used [Moonlight of Purification]."
"Removes all negative effects from the character."
The black mage kept bombarding me with curses, but it was easier to cleanse them than to cast them in the first place.
"Don't push too hard, just block!"
If I pushed back harder, I could take a few down, but we were sticking to a defensive strategy. 
Defense games are all about that, aren't they? You win as long as you don't get breached. The current situation wasn't much different.
"They can't escape, anyway."
To be precise, it wouldn't matter if they did. Their retreat was blocked. They were surrounded by monsters, and the boss monster was watching from above with eyes burning bright.
Even if the others managed to escape, the three who ended up behind me and got beaten up will be back in the Ice Eye within days. Their bodies will rot away.
Will they make it to the 8th floor while in that state? They seem to be out of food, too.
"Damn it, where did this guy come from…!"
The blunt weapon user, who had attempted to test his strength against me and was sent flying by a single kick, grimaced in despair.
"Didn't they say there's no one to stop us once we get out?"
Ah, so they harbored such hopes while growing up in the 8th floor, hidden from the Royal Family. 
It wasn't a completely false hope. The 8th floor has valuable essences everywhere, enough to become core essences. But...
"If they were going to do that, they should've made a proper team."
Even a Shield Barbarian's core is [Gigantification]. It's a 5th-grade essence acquired from hunting Orc Heroes, and its efficiency becomes insane when combined with [Unification].
It's not enough to just blindly equip high-level essences.
"Pepeless! L-Let's retreat!"
Seeing that I wasn’t even flinching under their attacks, the blunt weapon user requested a retreat. But the bald head wouldn't hear of it.
"Where do you think you're going?!"
"We at least need a brief moment to—"
"Don't be ridiculous! Fight!"
He knows. If they retreat to regroup, they'll face even tougher battles later. 
Ultimately, they only have one option.
"Just kill him! Kill him!"
"The rest are nothing!"
They have to break through us and make their way up.
"Behel—RAAAAHHHHH!!!"
Of course, I won't let them.
***
The battle continues. 
And once the tide turned, it never shifted back.
"...We can't hold out any longer!"
A raiding party, of sorts. The two adventurers who had tried to get past me to target the main force were back, retreating alongside our troops.
"Where's Culin…?"
"Don't you see? He's dead!"
They fought back with their backs against the wall, but couldn't hold out after one of them died.
"Good, that makes eleven now."
The enemy’s numbers had dwindled. On our side, there were no casualties. I was the focus of healing, and even the injured members were mostly just lightly wounded. But...
"This is the real test."
I tightened my guard, not daring to relax.  They would've realized by now. That they could really die if they kept this up.
"...I didn't think I'd have to risk my life here."
Humans are calculating creatures. When faced with a choice between life and death, they ultimately choose to give up. Everything except survival.
"That's the most terrifying state to encounter an enemy in."
If you're talking about boss monsters, it's the 'Enraged' pattern. They fight with their lives on the line, just to survive.
"Character's soul power is insufficient."
"[Gigantification] has ended."
Just as my MP ran out, my body shrunk back to normal.
"Yande, you go back and rest."
Amelia immediately moved to my right side.
"That's right. We'll hold this place."
To my left, it was Ravien.
"We shall take your place."
Jun and Kaislan joined from behind. 
Well, Kaislan may be uncertain, but Jun should be able to handle the main tanking role. 
It was more efficient to trust my comrades than to force myself to fight while my MP was depleted. I quickly withdrew from the front line and moved to the second line. I was ready to rush back in if any variable appeared.
"That monster's gone!"
"Now's our chance!"
The Noarck forces immediately regained their composure and charged at me, now that the thorn in their side was gone. However, it didn't take long for their momentum to falter.
"Jun Arshen has used [Divine Release]."
Even Jun turns into a monstrous tank when he uses all his skills, and…
Kaislan, Ravien, Amelia.
Hoooooong-!
It's a one-way ticket to death if you get hit by them.
"...Ugh!"
"Be careful!"
As the saying goes, the best defense is a good offense. We weren't just taking hits.  Sharp counterattacks were aimed at every opening, forcing the enemy to hesitate and stop their aggressive advance.
And...
"Pepeless, Riki Eimond is down!"
Another victory arrived soon after. The bombardment line of Erwen, Aquarava, and others had finally won the struggle, eliminating one of the enemy's ranged dealers.
This was incredibly encouraging.
"Character has the status effect [Whispers of Immortality] active."
Unlike the one who died on our side before, the Ice Eye field effect was activated, raising him as an Undead.
"Quick, push him back!  Knock him off the cliff!"
"AAARGH…!"
The Lich, a transformed mage, indiscriminately spammed his skills at our forces, but he was eventually subdued and sent tumbling over the cliff.
It was a shame we couldn't get an extra score due to our timely response, but...
"The remaining ranged attackers are two black mages, one mage, and one Karui priest."
The fierce battle continued. Kaislan took a significant blow and retreated, but a tank waiting in the second line immediately filled the gap, blocking the way.
"Hoo, hoo, hoo…."
Sven Parav.
He seemed nervous, taking deep breaths. But he was a paladin after all. He was the only one who could handle the main tanking role other than Jun and me.
Oh, and there was also a melee dealer change.
"Emily, come back!"
"..."
Amelia, with her depleted MP, retreated to the second line, and Rick Jegerstar, a warrior from the 3rd team, joined the front line.
We were using every advantage available on this narrow path, relying on our numerical superiority to face the enemy. But…
Phooong-!
The inevitable sacrifice happened.
A sharp, rock-like spear pierced his upper body. The very spear that instantly killed Might Million, who was in the tank position during the battle in Deadwood.
Creak…
Rick Jegerstar, who had joined the team not long ago, was killed.
He wasn't outside the field’s border, so [Whispers of Immortality] didn't activate. But...
"N-No! Rick...!"
Right, he was James Kalla’s friend, wasn't he?
"Puta Licorban! What are you doing! Block them!"
I quickly ordered the guide and melee warrior from the 2nd team to fill the gap, and at that moment, James Kalla rushed forward and embraced the body of his fallen friend.
But I remained cold and firm.
"...Kalla, get back to your position."
He might need words of comfort right now, but what he needed and what he had to do were two different things. 
Thankfully, James Kalla understood.
"Y-Yes..."
He muttered those two words before picking up his friend's body and moving to the backline. I couldn't say anything as I watched him clench his jaw and drag his trembling feet. I simply looked back to the battlefield.
Scurk-!
A sacrifice had been made, but another score appeared right at that moment.
"M-Mike is...!"
The blunt weapon user, a tank, was down. Ravien was the one who took him down.
He was wounded, though. 
The priest’s heals will keep him alive, but it’ll take time to recover.
"Character has the status effect [Whispers of Immortality] active."
The field effect activated again, transforming the enemy into an Undead. However, we didn't have much fun this time.
"What are you doing, all of you, retreat!"
The enemy drew our aggro and pulled back from the front line. This forced us to go through the trouble of eliminating the one we already took down.
But…
"Nine left... or ten, now that the Dragon Slayer's incapacitated..."
The enemy’s numbers were steadily dwindling. Victory was getting closer. Just as our ranged dealers were running out of MP, the enemy's resources were beginning to run dry.
"Quickly, use a curse spell!"
The black mage's curse spell, which was slowing their regeneration, was lifted, causing their bodies to rot. The black mage’s MP, which was being used to counter the priests, was finally exhausted.
"Good. We just need to keep this up."
I pulled back from the front line as soon as I saw Paladin Jun’s buffs run out, weakening his tanking ability.
“...Damn it, he's already recovered?!”
My MP wasn't fully recovered yet, but it was enough to keep [Gigantification] active.  [Soul Dive] would be back in cooldown soon, too.
"More importantly, now that the curse spell is gone, I don't have to keep dealing damage."
It was like a dam finally breaking after holding back with all its might. From now on, I just need to block them with my body and let the Ice Eye field effect do its thing. They'll collapse on their own.
"Push him back! Push him back!"
Knowing this, the enemy attempted to pull back their front line outside the field, but I clenched my jaw and held them off.
"The priests seem to have run out of divine power!"
While the heals provided a solid foundation, it didn’t matter much anymore. These guys were done. They were wielding their weapons with their rotten arms and legs, but that was it.
I was holding on, clinging to that hope.
Du-gug-!
Despair always comes unexpectedly.
"AAARGH...!"
A scream suddenly rang out. It was a sound I never wanted to hear, coming from behind us.
"Yande!!"
Kaislan yelled urgently, replacing me as I couldn’t turn around to see what was happening.
“...Enemy!  New enemy has appeared!”
A variable.
