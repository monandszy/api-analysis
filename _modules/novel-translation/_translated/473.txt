## Chapter 473: Us and Them (5)
The answer came after a long pause.
“A favor... you say...?"
Her voice was a far cry from the one she used when she’d boldly told me to get lost.
Although she tried to hide it, her trembling voice betrayed her fear.
And how could she not be afraid? She had seen enough of Baekho. This man was utterly mad and possessed unspeakable power.
"Yes, a favor," he said.
This wasn't a request. It was a demand.
“We’ve shared a bond over the years, don't you think?”
This was a threat.  
It was clear something dire would happen if she refused. That notion unconsciously dominated her thoughts.
But...
“…No.”
Misha’s words were firm.
“Not even going to listen?”
“Whatever you want, I won’t do it.”
Her eyes, though trembling, met Baekho’s gaze head-on with unwavering strength.
Baekho couldn’t hide his surprise.
“Wow..."
It was truly fascinating to him. Many people were fearless, but few could overcome their fear.
"How can someone change so drastically in a single moment?”
What could have been the driving force behind her newfound resolve? The answer was simple.
“Hansu Hyung is incredible, isn't he? How long has he been wooing her? Just look at her now.”
Baekho let out a chuckle.
Misha, although unaware of the exact nature of the change, felt a sense of relief. She could finally breathe freely. 
"I understand. Love makes everyone blind, you know. I wonder if Hansu Hyung even knows... Hmm? What's that? You want to say something?”
“….Who is Hansu?”
“What?”
Baekho's face momentarily blanked before erupting into laughter. 
“Ha! Haha! Hahaha!  Ah, right. You’re right. Of course. Silly me!”
Misha frowned at the sound of his laughter. Baekho, finally calming down, answered her question.
“Lee Hansu is your husband's real name. Got it?”
Even though Baekho seemed to be mocking her, Misha didn't react. She simply repeated the name as if etching it into her mind. 
“...Lee Hansu.”
"It's Hansu, not Hans." 
Despite improving since then, she struggled with the pronunciation, finally managing to pronounce the name correctly after a long moment.
"Lee Hansu."
“Oh, that's better.”
“Lee Hansu. Yes, that's Bjorn’s…."
Misha clasped her hands together and closed her eyes, as if safeguarding something precious. Baekho watched her with a peculiar look. 
Of course, this didn’t last long. Baekho had a long-standing rule: He only played around after finishing all his work.
“So, are you really not going to do me this favor?”
“...Why should I?”
“Well, I don't know.”
Baekho shrugged. He was known for his playful nature and willingness to lie without remorse. 
“What if Bjorn Jandel dies if you don’t?”
It was an undeniable truth.

After the Round Table ended, I immediately logged out and went to sleep. I was so exhausted from being fully immersed for 12 hours that waking up early would be impossible.
“Sir! Wake up!”
“…Five more minutes.”
“Don’t be ridiculous.  We’re almost done. We only need to pack up here.”
“…Already?”
I opened my eyes and checked the time: 11:00 am.  Ugh, I really wanted to wake up earlier today.
"Wait a minute. I'll pack my things from my room."
"Why bother? Go wash up."
"Yes. Sir, we can do it, it's not even that heavy.”
No, it’s too much. 
I rushed to wash up and returned to pack my things from my room.  Four large carts were already parked in the garden, fully loaded with belongings ready for our move.
Kuuung-! 
With the last item loaded—a steel bed designed for barbarians—the packing was finally complete.
“We’re ready to leave, Baron Jandel.”
“Alright, I’m counting on you.”
The hired drivers took the carts and left, leaving us alone in the empty mansion.
“...This feels strange."
Erwen, looking slightly forlorn at the empty living room, had lost her belongings and this home.
I couldn’t blame her. We had definitely built some memories here, both good and bad.
[It's not like we're going to go out again, anyway.]
She was so troubled at the time that I wondered how she would cope.
But she seemed to have settled down.
She was facing a much greater impact from the stats than before.
‘It must have been the mental impact that was greater than the stats.’
Erwen was a constant source of concern for me.
Well, if I had to pick the biggest worry, it would be someone else.
‘…Baekho. I wonder when he'll release her. He won't come looking just because we moved, right? Hmm, that wouldn't be good….’
“What are you thinking? Let’s go. We need to unpack everything before evening.”
I checked the house one last time to make sure nothing was left behind before leaving, lost in thought for a moment.
We hastily departed for our destination.
The driver for the single day rental cart was our clan's only navigator, Auyen.  This guy was more than just a good sailor, it turned out.
“…You’re really good with horses.”
"I used to work as a driver until I became an adult. I also know the city's roads very well.  Of course, compared to you, my skills are insignificant."
"Flattery will get you—"
Anyway, I had a sudden thought: Perhaps we could buy a cart and bring Auyen along with us.
Our new house even has a stable.
He used to drive, so he must know how to care for horses.
‘Hmm, not bad.’
It seemed like a good idea, so I asked Amelia, who responded positively. 
"Every group needs its own role.  If Auyen is willing, I don’t mind."
"Rokrok, what about you? You heard everything, right?”
"I, I would be honored! If you allow me, I’ll dedicate myself to serving you, Clan Leader!"
Auyen seemed genuinely pleased, and it wasn’t just a polite gesture. 
After all, it was better than being cooped up in his room all day.
I'll look into this separately later.
“We’ve arrived, Clan Leader.”
I was dozing off, mesmerized by Auyen's smooth driving, and before I knew it, we were at our destination.
Kommelby's main street. 
A three-story building located in the bustling district, just 10 minutes from the Alminus Central Trade Center.
“…It’s in much better condition than I expected."
"Yeah, I thought it would be much older, based on the rent."
This building was owned by the Melves Trading Company. We could rent it at a low price thanks to a previous agreement.
It would be the Clan House for Clan Anabada.
However, since we didn’t have any office workers yet, we decided to stay here until Baron Jandel's mansion was finished.
“Alright, let's get the luggage inside. Everyone’s already staring.”
Rumors must have spread that I’d moved here because citizens and explorers passing by were gathering to watch.
Is it their first time seeing a noble moving?
“Ugh…."
Anyway, since we had four explorers, we finished unpacking within the day.
The first floor had a structure that made it unsuitable for residential use, so we decided to leave it as a living room. The second floor housed Amelia and Erwen's rooms, while the third floor was mine and Auyen’s.
Oh, by the way, Auyen was assigned a room with a window, as requested by Amelia…
“A room overlooking Kommelby’s main street… I never thought I’d live in a place like this…”
This was quite an unexpected reaction. 
I thought he'd be happy to be out of the basement and in a place with sunlight, but I didn’t expect him to be on the verge of tears.
"Where did you live before?"
"Even in Lavigion, it was on the outskirts."
"You mean the slums near the city walls?"
"Yes…."
A navigator, especially one from a clan known for its frequent raiding, would have made a lot of money, wouldn’t they?
Out of curiosity, I asked him, and Auyen replied that he was practically a slave in his clan and never received proper compensation.
"Why did you stay there then?"
“You wouldn't understand, Clan Leader. There are many clans like that.  People who get sucked in without knowing, and then can’t escape...”
Clan rules and contracts.
And the crimes they committed in the maze—shackles that kept them from escaping.
It was strange, though. I didn’t feel sorry for him. 
The true victims were the explorers who were raided and killed.
"Do your best from now on. I'll be watching."
"Of, of course, Clan Leader! Please believe in me!"
I didn’t really believe him, so I decided to give him a one-hour life lesson.
"This is all for your own good, so don't take it lightly. A man needs to be as honest and steadfast as I am. Understand?"
“…Yes.”
“Voice.”
“Yes! Clan Leader!”
There, that’s better. 
***
We had a lot to do, even after moving in.
"No, the back lot is going to be the garden."
“Garden? It would be much more useful as a training ground.”
While Amelia and Erwen argued about decorating the house, I went out early in the morning to take care of some work.
I got a call from the Rabbit Baron.  
she mentioned that she found some properties for sale that met my conditions.  She asked me to visit and check them out.
Oh, and she also had a complaint.
[…I still don't understand why you want to build your mansion in District 7 instead of the Imperial City. It’s not too late, so maybe you should reconsider.]
I had decided to build my mansion in District 7, where I felt at home.
After all, even a noble family needs its head to be an explorer.
It would be better to be as close to the Dimensional Plaza as possible.
‘Building a house in the Imperial City would be nothing more than a tiny space.’
District 7 would allow for a much more impressive mansion for the same cost, so it was a more logical choice.
‘…Alright, so now that I’ve found a place, I just need to build the mansion?’
Fortunately, there was one property that I liked among the available ones, so I immediately decided to buy it.
All that was left was to discuss with an architect from the Melves Trading Company to design a blueprint and start construction.
However, it would take at least a year to complete.
‘That ends my day.’
After falling asleep in my house the next day, I visited the Dwarf’s smithy to boost my work efficiency. I then went to see Lothmiller and made a proposal.
“...Are you serious?  You want to teach exploration skills to barbarians?"
"I'll pay you handsomely. You said you had nothing better to do."
“That’s true, but… if this is out of concern for me, then you don’t need to—."
"Don't be silly. I’m not doing this for you; there’s no one else who's suitable.  Just do me this favor.”
Thinking he was being cared for, Lothmiller initially tried to refuse, but he ultimately agreed to the proposal, understanding that this was a genuine need.
"Let's go to the Barbarian territory right away. The Second Elder will tell you how to do it. If you can’t come to an agreement with him, go to the administrative office."
“...Administrative office?”
Lothmiller seemed surprised that the barbarians had such a thing. I felt a little hurt. 
This is the 21st century!
One day, two days, three days, four days.
Anyway, time passed quickly after that.
Bersiel Goulond, who had finally settled all his affairs with the church, was the first among the expedition members to join Clan Anabada.
“...You mean, as the vice-leader?”
"Yeah, you're up to the task."
“I agree, but I think it’s better to leave the vice-leader position vacant. People will gossip if I take it.”
“...I understand, but if I had to pick a reason, it would be because of this.”
“...Don't worry. It’s just the title that’s a regular member, but I’ll do the vice-leader's work.  Of course, since I don’t have the title, you’ll need me quite a bit.”
"Alright, let’s do it that way. Thanks."
"But… Are you really going to do it? The Layer Lord."
"Of course, I will. You’re coming too."
"...It's a bit overwhelming to face a Layer Lord on our first expedition."
“What, are you going to file a complaint with the Royal Family?”
"Oh come on, it’s just a joke.”
After Bersiel officially joined the clan, we began to prepare for the five-man raid.
To be honest, I was distracted and couldn't concentrate. 
‘Why isn't she coming…?’
Misha still hadn’t arrived.
Did that jerk Baekho break his promise?
My anxieties began to grow, but I could do nothing.
I could only wait and do what I had to.
“Going out again this morning?”
“Today’s the last day. After today, I’m free until the maze opens.”
“I see. You're working hard.”
"I might be late, so don’t bother making dinner. I’ll just end up eating cold food again like last time.”
With that, I headed out to the open space.
Then I tore up the piece of paper that Raviyen had secretly given me a while ago.
Swaaaa—
A magic circle soon appeared on the floor, and the light that emanated from it engulfed my body.
"Long time no see."
"Yeah, long time no see.”
I stood before the Dragon Temple after several years. As I looked at the old man on the throne, I repeated today's task to myself.
‘Deliver the Dragon Slayer's Heart and get my reward.’
It was the last quest for this month.
