## Chapter 458: Raid (3)
To truly enjoy [Dungeon and Stone], one must be quick-witted and adaptable. This isn't about active Essence setups, but the very fundamentals of gameplay.  Suddenly encountering a crack, a raider, or even betrayal from a fellow adventurer—these unpredictable situations occur in every session.
Like now, for instance.
"Sir, this…."
"Yes, it's true."
The Floor Monarch had been summoned. In other words, one of the explorers on the third floor had placed seven human corpses inside the hut, summoning the being. Whether it was intentional or accidental remained unclear. Or, to be precise, I knew it was intentional… but...
"It could be a genuine coincidence."
My reasoning stemmed from none other than myself.  My past self and Misha had been in a similar situation.  We had burned corpses out of desperation for a good night's rest in the hut.  Coincidentally, someone had already burned corpses before us, leading to the 'accident' of summoning a Floor Monarch.
In any case, that wasn't the point.
"Yandell, what do we do?"
"We escape the forest first. We can't reach the fourth floor anyway."
Once the Chaos Monarch, Riakis, is summoned, all portals on the third floor become deactivated. Simply put, the entire third floor transforms into a boss room.
"I'll handle them."
Without even needing to draw her bow, Erwen swiftly dispatched three Chaos Spirits with her Fire Spirit.
"Chaos Spirit destroyed."
"This location is being corrupted."
We only need to manage the tiles when fighting a boss, but since we're not hunting Riakis anyway...
"Grrrrrrrrrrrr—!!!!!"
A familiar howl echoed from the direction of the Witch's Forest.  It felt slightly off.  I had hoped to hear that howl again only when it was time to finish this beast off.
"Bjorn! We can't just run away.  Shouldn't we do something?"
"Are you suggesting we four hunt a Floor Monarch?"
Strictly speaking, it would be five if you included Auyen, but no one dared mention it.  Not that it would change anything.  The impossible doesn't become possible just because of that.
As we moved further away from the forest boundary, those familiar figures emerged from the shadows.
"Bjorn! Look at that ugly thing crawling towards us! What is it?"
"It's a Chaos Spirit."
When Riakis is summoned, these token-type monsters infest the entire third floor. They have a unique characteristic: they chase their target relentlessly until they die once they lock onto a target.
"Phew, it's been ages since I saw these guys."
"Bjorn, I meant… isn't there anything else we can do? I heard a lot of people died the last time, right?"
Yes… I had heard about it.  Frankly, it made me furious, as I was partially responsible for the accident.
"Oh, and also! I heard that there's a duty for upper-level explorers to step in when a disaster strikes!"
Ah, yes, that explorer's oath.  That was why the Dzarwi clan, who were present on the third floor at the time, had protected the lower-level explorers.  Large clans simply had to be mindful of the Guild's opinion.
"They might've wanted to avoid any losses, though, since they also took all the remaining money…"
But one thing was certain.  If the Dzarwi clan hadn't been there, many more people would have died.  They gathered lower-level explorers and protected them for a whole day, not to mention they held the Floor Monarch off for almost four hours after it arrived.
"W, well, I don't know what to do in these situations since I can't do anything except fight.  But Bjorn, you—."
"Einar, calm down."
We stopped in our tracks, and Einar shut his mouth.  Though he seemed to feel guilty, he didn't avoid my gaze. 
I felt it again, in those eyes of his.
"…"
Einar is a righteous man.  He only shows no mercy to monsters and raiders.  He generally approaches others with kindness, and he wants to help if possible.  And…
"Don't worry. I don't intend to stand by and do nothing either."
I don't think that's a bad thing. 
Because I found out, by chance, that being generous doesn't always result in loss.
"Oh! So that's how it is!"
"Did you think I'd just stand by and watch? There are quite a few of our kind on the third floor, you know?"
While I said that, I had absolutely no intention of standing by regardless of the issue of my kind.  My reputation score was already so high.  If it got out that I had abandoned everyone during the disaster, public opinion would turn against me.
Therefore...
"Ooooooooo!!!! So, what should we do now?!  I'll even jump into the fire if you say so!"
"We'll observe from here for now."
"………Huh?"
We kept a safe distance and watched the forest.
The reason was quite simple.
"Maybe… we don't even have to intervene?"
"It's rare for the Guild to grant permission to hunt a Floor Monarch on the third floor.  Maybe it was summoned by a clan for an unauthorized hunt."
"Ah! So if they take care of it, then there's no problem!"
"That's right."
Of course, this was mere speculation, with nothing confirmed.  And that's why...
"Grrrrrrrrrrrr—!!!!!"
We kept an eye on the forest, where the terrifying roar of the monster echoed, while Erwen relayed information in real time.
"Riakis is heading west towards the Witch's Forest. It's too far away, so I can't see clearly, but there seem to be quite a few people around."
"How many?"
"I'm not sure. It's too far away…"
"Then we'll get closer."
We then skirted the edge of the forest and moved west. Thanks to Erwen's incredible detection ability, we obtained more precise information.
“…There are about fifteen of them. They seem to be being chased by Riakis at the moment."
Well, it's more like they're choosing a place to hunt.  The Witch's Forest, with its many obstacles obscuring vision, is not a good environment for raids.
My interest, however, lay elsewhere.
"Fifteen…"
It's not the number you'd expect for a raid.  Well, I suppose they could take it down if they properly organized a raid force…
"Fifteen is probably the decoy team, and the main force is waiting somewhere else."
"Y, you think so?"
"Can you hear anything they're saying?"
"No. It's like they're using some kind of 'Voice Control' magic. I can't hear anything at all."
"Hm, I see?"
It was a shame, but at least it was one less thing to worry about.  If it truly was an accidental disaster, I'd have to run in and handle it myself…
Drip, drip, drip-
Black rain began to fall from the sky.  It was like acid, burning the skin just from touching it.  It was Riakis's passive aura skill.
"Character is taking continuous Chaos damage."
"Character's resistance has drastically decreased."
"Warning: Continuous exposure to Chaos damage may inflict the [Confusion] status ailment."
In other words, we had reached the monster's vicinity.
"We need to back off a bit."
Without a Cleric, we had no way to resist this passive skill.  We adjusted our distance, following the edge of the rain. 
How much time had passed since then?
"They're about to exit the forest!"
The third floor, devoid of the light-absorbing abyssal darkness of the Labyrinth.  Though I didn't have exceptional eyesight like Erwen or Amelia, I could see a dozen or so explorers running towards us in a group.
"Whoooong-! Whoooong-! Whoooong-!"
Ah, of course, a gigantic beast was chasing them from behind.
"Erwen, check it out quickly.  What clan is it?"
"...There's no emblem."
Huh, they removed their emblems?  Well, they're unauthorized hunters.
They were running at full speed, with Riakis in tow, before swiftly disappearing.  Amelia turned to me and asked,
"Yandell, what do we do now?"
"We follow them."
"Why?"
"If they fail, it'll be a real disaster."
Besides, you never know.  Maybe we'll get a chance to get involved.
***
We followed the group, presumed to be the decoy team, and arrived at the ‘Bramble Field’.
"Ah, this is the usual spot."
There are no obstacles, the ground is flat, and the area is wide. It's the perfect field for managing tiles.  Judging by the fact that the brambles, which reached up to our shoulders, were all burned away…
"Sir, there's the main force—."
Suddenly, the radio we were listening to cut off.
"What happened?"
"They noticed our presence.  Now, one of them is rapidly approaching."
"Can we create distance? Can we shake them off?"
"...I don't think we can all escape together.  They're just one person."
Hm, I see.  Thanks to this, even the need to think was gone.  I quickly made my decision.
"Then we'll wait here."
Why run away when we didn't do anything wrong?
In any case, I was curious.  What kind of people would be carrying out an unauthorized hunt that could lead to innocent casualties?
"Here they come."
Not long after, a figure appeared as a mere dot in the distance, rushing towards us through the burned-out bramble field.  It didn't take long for the dot to grow into a human form.
Thud.
The man stopped about ten meters away.  With a total of seven daggers hanging from his belt, it was clear that he was very agile.
"…"
"…"
The man's expression hardened as soon as he saw me, and he didn't say a word. 
It was me who spoke first.
"Why are you silent? You were running towards me a moment ago."
"To meet a celebrity like you in such a place… well, it is a rare sight."
Ah, that's why.  The reason for the pained expression.
"It's an honor to meet you, Baron Yandell.  I never expected to see such a big shot on the third floor—."
"Cut it out.  So, who are you?"
I cut him off and asked again.  The man seemed to think for a moment before opening his mouth.
"My name is Malid Kebron."
Though I couldn't tell if that was his real name or not, he introduced himself as such.  I shortened his name to 'Dagger-wielding fellow' and asked a follow-up question.
"Your clan?"
"...We belong to the Sawtooth Clan."
"Sawtooth, huh?"
One of the four remaining super-giant clans, which had shrunk from ten during the war. It was the same clan where James Kala had served as deputy leader.
"Interesting.  You being on the third floor is more surprising than me being here, wouldn't you say?"
I asked with a sly smile.  The Dagger-wielding fellow boldly countered.
"We have our reasons.  But by any chance, Baron, did you summon the Floor Monarch?"
What a bold move!  He dared to try and get ahead in this situation.
"It wasn't me."
"Really?"
"But if I were to ask you the same question, you'd naturally say no, right?"
"We truly did not."
"Are you saying the group moving with Riakis has no relation to you?"
"They are indeed members of our clan. But we were merely nearby and stepped in to resolve the situation according to our oath."
Oh, what a smooth talker.
"That's good.  We'll help from now on."
I gently offered my services. The Dagger-wielding fellow's face turned cold.
"I am truly grateful for your initiative, but I believe there's no need for the Baron's precious help."
Huh?  He doesn't even want to work with me even though I'm a noble?
For a moment, I felt the urge to smash his skull with my hammer, but I managed to hold back…
"The other noble lords would not want the Baron's actions to undermine the prestige of noble houses."
"…"
What did I just hear?
"The other lords… Are you referring to someone like Earl Alminers? One of the Sawtooth Clan's sponsors?"
I asked to confirm, and the man chuckled, confidently replying,
"Yes, that's right."
Ah, so I understood correctly.  There was no longer any reason to maintain polite conversation.
What?  Don't be greedy if you don't want to find yourself in a difficult situation?
"What are you blabbering about, you crazy bastard?"
"………Excuse me? Did you hear wrong?"
He seemed to be as clueless as a new recruit, freezing up.  I took a step forward, staring at the Dagger-wielding fellow.
"Hey, Dagger."
"...Yes?"
"Is your head filled with goblin shit?"
"Excuse me? What are you... talking about...?"
No, it's not like that.  Your arrogant tone… and the way you're constantly backing away while sweating profusely…
"Well, we'll see what's inside once we open it up, won't we?"
I slowly raised my hammer.
