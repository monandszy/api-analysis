## The Age of Exploration (1)
I first heard about the Record Stone during a conversation with the GM. 
[There's no reason not to believe it. At least the story of the Record Stone is true.]
It was the GM's response to my question about why I should believe Avil Gavius's almost prophetic words that a player would open the Abyssal Gate. 
Hearing this, I made a judgment.
I concluded that Baekho was also highly likely to be connected to the Record Stone.
The reason was that, just like the GM, Baekho was fixated on the nickname 'Elfnuna.'
But…
[Hmm, really?]
I didn't want to provoke Baekho that day, so I avoided mentioning it. I also wanted to investigate alone before bringing that question to the surface.
However, the investigation was futile. 
‘There was no such record in the library. Bercyl seemed to have never heard of it either.’
I used my spare time to look into it, but I couldn't find a single trace of the Record Stone.
Therefore, there was only one way left.
To ask the one who could give me an answer.
“….”
Baekho remained silent in response to my question about the Record Stone. 
But as he had just said to Hyeonbyeol, silence can sometimes be a strong affirmation.
‘So, he does know what the Record Stone is.’
It was worth deliberately asking vaguely, cutting off the context. Had he also judged that the golden opportunity to casually dismiss it had already passed?
Baekho continued his silence, staring at me as if trying to read my mind.
And…
“Hyung.”
He finally opened his mouth slowly, breaking the silence. He didn't even realize the smile had vanished from his lips. 
“Where did you hear about it?”
Baekho asked in a chillingly low voice. 
I felt a shiver down my spine, but I didn’t show it. After all, words always hold intentions.
Why did he first check the ‘source’?
‘He’s curious about how much I know.’
Knowing his intention, there was only one response I could make. 
“I don’t know.”
I answered vaguely, maintaining my composure and avoiding urgency, seizing control of the conversation.
“Does it matter where I heard it?”
As I shrugged and replied, Baekho's eyes turned even more meaningful. 
He seemed to be in deep thought.
Was he asking because he really didn't know what the Record Stone was? 
Or was he asking just to compare it with his own knowledge?
If so, what was the best way to answer?
Should I just pretend I don't know?
In the fleeting moment, I felt Baekho carefully choosing his next response. Deciding that giving him more time wasn't good, I continued speaking immediately. 
Even though I was aware it was an abrupt timing.
But perhaps that made it even more effective.
“Elfnuna.”
I brought up the subject that would shake him the most.
Even the strongest tree.
If you shake it hard enough, some dust will surely fall. 
“…….!”
Baekho's eyes flickered, ever so slightly, when the nickname that had never been mentioned between us was brought up.
It wasn't enough yet.
So…
“You know, don’t you? That I’m that person.”
I revealed another card I had been holding. 
Baekho’s reaction was immediate.
“…What are you talking about?”
A counter-question, neither an affirmation nor a denial. 
It was a common pattern for liars. 
They only ask back, they don't lie, making them feel psychologically secure.
I had to push harder.
“Baekho-ya.”
“……?”
“Do you know this? From the moment we first met until now. We’ve never talked about ‘Elfnuna’ once.”
As I spoke, I tapped the nickname window above my head, the one with ‘Elfnunna’ written on it.
“Doesn't it seem strange to you?”
There was no room for excuses, a dead end.
Thud, thud, thud.
The sound of burning firewood continued endlessly in the heavy silence.
I didn't press further, giving Baekho time to think. 
Usually, when things reach this point, the one who lied is uncomfortable with the silence. 
“Hyung…,” Baekho finally broke the long silence.
“What do you want to ask me?”
He still seemed to be walking a tightrope, a cowardly mindset of trying to hold out as long as possible before giving anything away. 
It was easy to solve. 
“I don’t want to ask you anything.”
I limited his information completely, giving him the choice.
At this point, it didn't matter where I heard the story.
Or how much I knew.
“I just want to hear it,” I said casually, tapping my fingers.
“What you’re going to say.”
The choice was Baekho's. 
***
Baekho made his decision faster than I expected.
“Ugh, Hyung, you’re such a pain! I can’t handle you!” 
His lively tone from before had returned, as if it had always been this way. 
It was eerie for a bystander, as if they were facing a two-faced person, but I was used to it now, so it didn't matter much.
“I’ll tell you everything. What’s the first thing you’re curious about?”
Huh, this little punk is still at it.
I almost fell for it.
“….”
When I didn’t reply and just stared at him, Baekho shook his head.
“…Were you really a company worker, Hyung?”
“….”
“No, I’m just curious. What kind of life did you have to live to become like this?”
What is he saying, as if he was a fresh-faced recruit right out of the army?
When I didn’t answer again, Baekho sighed deeply.
“Hah… alright. I’ll tell you. Honestly, it does feel like you’re just testing me… but this is making me so nervous, I can’t stand it. It’s better to just confess and find peace.”
“Go ahead.”
“Do you believe in destiny, Hyung?”
“….”
“Ugh, I can’t bring myself to speak. Should I just explain it regardless of whether you understand it or not?”
“I told you. I’m curious what you’re going to say.”
“Alright, let’s do it that way.”
Baekho seemed frustrated by my attitude, but I couldn't help it. Any question that might lead to a mistake should be met with silence.
“You know, right? That when this city was built, most ancient relics and myths were erased. One of the items erased from the world was the Record Stone.”
“The Record Stone is said to contain all the history of the world. Not just the past, but the future too.”
Sounds like something you’d hear in a myth, right?
Actually, the story I’m about to tell you feels kind of like that.
Baekho mumbled, then continued.
“Anyway, the Record Stone also has an ending. Naturally, that ending signifies the end of this world. And it's said that the ending began with the witch… I don't know much about that part either. The only thing I know is this.”
“Someone destroyed the Record Stone to prevent the ending, and that's how this world was saved from destruction.”
“The important part is this. The fragments of the Record Stone that were not destroyed are scattered throughout the world.”
That rang a bell. 
‘The Shard of Records.’
The artifact known to be the legacy of Gavrillius, the one that sent Amelia and me back to the past.
“Some of the fragments have actually been found. I’ve seen three of them myself.”
I felt a little annoyed by those words.
After all, he said he’d seen them? 
[The Shard of Records…? I’ve heard of it, but it actually existed.]
This little punk has been lying since then, has he.
I wanted to fire back, but I held my tongue, not wanting to interrupt the flow of the story. 
The important part was just beginning.
“One of the fragments had this written on it,” Baekho said, pausing for a moment.
“And thus, the Evil Spirit ‘————’ from the other world opened the Abyssal Gate, finally fulfilling its desire.”
A line that seemed like it could only appear in an ending scene.
“I couldn't say the name because there are no letters on the Record Stone. It represents people's names with unique patterns instead. It’s a name attached to the soul or something.”
“….”
“Anyway, that's not important. I saw that pattern on other fragments too. It said this.”
Thump!
“…The first one to pass the original test, ‘————’, finally opened its eyes in this world.”
Finally, the long-held doubts were cleared. 
Why Avil Gavius fawned over those who had cleared the original difficulty.
Why the GM became a fanatic of ‘Elfnuna’. 
And why Baekho was so afraid of my hostility.
“Hyung… you've been silent this whole time. If you didn't know about the Record Stone, this would be the most curious thing for you.”
Baekho’s story continued as I sat in silence, organizing my thoughts.
“What's the point of that record? It’s all meaningless anyway since it’s already broken.”
“….”
“I thought so too at first, but I was wrong. The last fragment I saw actually came true.”
“…What was it?”
I finally opened my mouth, breaking my silence, and Baekho grinned in response.
“It’s a secret.”
“…What?”
I immediately shot him a look, asking what kind of trick this was, but Baekho wasn't bothered by it.
“I’m going to keep this a secret. Whether you believe it or not, this is my personal story. It’s not really related to you either.”
I couldn't press further.
I had a hunch that ‘personal’ was not a lie.
“Ah… so, we’re done with the Record Stone now… so, it’s ‘Elfnuna’ next, right?”
When I nodded, Baekho resumed the story he had stopped.
“I created this chatroom right after I found out about the Record Stone. I waited. ‘Elfnuna’ had the highest chance of clearing the original. And that person is Korean.”
“….”
“Everything else was just as you guessed, Hyung. I’ve been hoping you might be that person since you came. And my hope wasn’t misplaced.”
Baekho stared at me with clear eyes and asked.
“Right?”
A heartfelt conversation where we had been hiding our true selves from each other for a long time. There was no point in dodging at this point, so I admitted it coolly.
“Right.”
Although I heard the answer from my own lips, Baekho didn't react strongly, as if it was something he was already convinced of.
He just nodded, his voice somewhat relieved.
“That’s all I have to say. How about it, Hyung? Have your questions been answered?”
But I shook my head.
“No, not yet.”
Most of my doubts had been cleared, but one crucial question remained.
The most important one in understanding someone.
“Why did you hide this story from me until now?”
The motive was missing.
“You didn’t seem to have any reason to hide it, from what I heard.”
I directly pointed it out, and Baekho chuckled wryly in response.
“Destiny is like a monkey’s paw, you know.”
His voice was so full of sadness. 
***
“…Monkey’s paw?”
I glared at him with eyes asking for a detailed explanation.
“Eek? You don’t know what a monkey’s paw is, Hyung?”
“I do know what it is, but I’m wondering why you brought that up all of a sudden.”
“It’s exactly as it sounds. The stories written on the Record Stone always come true. However, we can’t know if that’s what we want.”
“…Continue.”
“You’re definitely going to open the Abyssal Gate someday. But will it be a happy ending? You’re going to fulfill your desire, but will it include my desire too?”
“….”
“That’s why I didn’t tell you. I tried to keep you in the dark as much as possible. To make your desire become my desire.”
I understood what he meant.
I’ve done similar things in the past.
[Amelia’s older sister, Laura, will die.]
I used all sorts of tricks to twist that confirmed future, and I succeeded.
Baekho probably had a similar plan.
That’s why he showed his true colors right after I said I didn’t want to go home.
“Then why did you team up with the Doombringer?”
I finally asked about the thing that had been bothering me.
“You didn’t just become friends with him because you needed a mage, did you?”
Baekho stiffened for a moment at those words, then let out a dry chuckle.
“Hah… do you have a lie detector in your head, Hyung?”
A lie detector, my ass.
You’re the one carrying something like that.
“Alright, just answer. This is my last question.”
When I urged him again, Baekho slowly opened his mouth.
“Hyung, you know… I don’t know how this will sound to you, but…”
“It’s okay. Just tell me quickly.”
“Doombringer… don’t worry about him too much. He’s just Plan B.”
“Plan B…?”
“Yeah. The world doesn’t always go my way, does it?”
Baekho laughed brightly, his twisted mind’s madness not hidden.
“We have to prepare for when Plan A fails.”
“….”
“I’m going to get out of this shitty place, no matter what.”
