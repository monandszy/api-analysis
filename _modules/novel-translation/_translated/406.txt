##  Dilemma (3)
After the lottery ended, the winners gathered to form a "bond." Then, together, they marched toward the stele that stood tall in the central area.
Wooooong-!
As they placed their hands on the stele, a portal opened with a kaleidoscope of colors.
“Hmm, intriguing. The flow of magic is distinctly palpable, but it differs significantly from the usual deployment of spatial magic.”
“Is this your first time witnessing a portal’s opening?”
“Yes. A mage has no reason to tie oneself to official duties.”
Amidst the chatter of the adventurers, each one offering their observations as the portal opened, the radiating light soon coalesced into a distinct shape.
“You’ve successfully opened a portal. EXP +2.”
Sigh. I always think it’s a bit unfair that opening an 8th-floor portal is the same as opening a 1st-floor portal.
Wooooooong-!
The kaleidoscopic light, now a sphere, shimmered and pulsated. I turned around and found everyone staring silently at me.
Right. They want me to be the first to open it, the first to step through, don’t they?
“Form the battle formation!”
Worried that there might be someone waiting on the other side, I ordered the formation to be set up before stepping into the portal.
Flash-!
A blinding white light engulfed my vision. Soon, like broken pieces coming together, my vision focused.
“You’ve entered the 8th-floor Dawn Land.”
Dawn Land. The deepest level of the labyrinth, labeled “Dawn Land” in the game.
“Achievement unlocked.”
Condition: Reach the 8th floor.
Reward: Permanent increase in Soul Strength by +50.
I felt a familiar sensation, my Soul Vessel widening like when I first entered the 5th-floor Great Maze.
They called it a “ceremony,” didn't they? This mystical phenomenon where the Tower bestows its blessing upon adventurers who complete their tasks.
Wooooooong-!
I scanned my surroundings, taking in the unfamiliar landscape, as the rest of the team entered the portal.
“No enemies… for now.”
“That’s a relief. I was worried we’d face a scenario similar to the ‘Goblin Forest Battle’ where the enemy would be waiting for us.”
“Finally, I’ve made it to the 8th floor.”
“This alone makes participating in the expedition worthwhile.”
Almost half the adventurers in our team had received the ceremony. Or maybe more than half, considering we shouldn’t count the mages and priests?
Of course, the 8th floor and beyond are categorized as the depths.
“It’s an extraordinary place…….”
Erwin seemed to be experiencing the 8th floor for the first time.
The only ones with experience here would be Amelia and maybe that Ravien over there.
“Enemies, the 8th floor, whatever! Let’s eat already!!!”
“Woooooo!!!”
“I need healing first! Please, just heal me already! My fingers have been visibly festering since yesterday, and now I’ve lost all feeling in them!”
I ordered a rest period before a mutiny broke out. The food we had been hauling on the sled was all gone, but the rations stored in our dimensional spaces were still intact.
Scritch, scratch, scratch.
Chomp, chomp, chomp.
Once permission was granted, everyone immediately started consuming food from their dimensional spaces, stuffing it into their mouths with greedy abandon. Those with minor injuries, unable to receive healing, chewed on dried meat while searching for a priest.
“Uncle, let’s eat too.”
“Alright.”
My stomach was equally empty and ready to implode, so I quickly retrieved some rations from my dimensional space and joined my team, eating together in a cozy circle.
“I’ve heard about it, but I never realized how peaceful it was.”
“You mean this Dawn Land?”
“Yes. I imagined it to be a terrifying place, much scarier than the depths…….”
Well, her impression wasn’t entirely wrong.
Rolling green hills stretched before me, a picturesque sight, and the warm air carried on the breeze caressed my skin. Compared to before, when we were shivering even with thick furs, this was a stark and welcome change.
“You guys rest here. I’m going to scout the surroundings.”
After filling my stomach, I decided to leave my companions and explore. A captain has a captain’s work to do, right? I could munch on dried meat while I walked.
Scritch, scratch.
I popped five dried meat strips into my mouth at once and chewed while walking, a luxury I could never have imagined just hours ago. 
However, a sense of unease overshadowed my happiness. That was precisely why I couldn't relax and felt compelled to roam around.
‘No rifts… anywhere.’
The 8th-floor Dawn Land is a remarkably small area. Its total field size is probably the smallest of all the labyrinth floors.
And there are no monsters. At least, not before entering a rift.
‘In this situation… the most logical assumption is that they were the first to enter.’
The 8th floor always has a rift open. The type is random, and upon successfully clearing the rift, two portals open, providing a choice:
Proceed to the 9th floor.
Or return to the 8th floor.
Regardless of the chosen path, a new rift will regenerate on the 8th floor once the current one is cleared, continuing the cycle indefinitely.
And here’s the problem…
‘Those Noark bastards are definitely the ones who entered the rift.’
Will they head to the 9th floor?
Or will they choose to stay on the 8th floor and continue hunting in a different rift?
If the latter, even the fact that we’re resting here right now is a significant liability. If they’re active on the 8th floor, they must be an expedition team, and they’re likely not weaker than us.
‘Anyway, now I understand why the Royal Family is so concerned.’
After visiting the 8th floor myself, I can truly grasp the situation. The Royal Family lost many high-ranking adventurers in the war two years ago. 
Of course, they have since recovered some of their strength through policy support, abundant Soul Essence supply, and the return of retired adventurers. However…
‘The gap will only widen if we do nothing.’
Noark is basically using cheat codes. They started on the 7th floor on the first day of entry? That means they can immediately ascend to the 8th floor and extract the highest-grade Soul Essence.
If this continues for a few more years, the gap between high-ranking adventurers will grow exponentially.
‘…Still, Soul Essence can’t be erased. Even if they have high-grade Essence, their combinations are probably subpar?’
Well, most of them probably are. I've never seen anyone in this world who can create Soul Essence combinations as efficient as mine.
90% of them are likely using a haphazard approach to their stats. But as always, there’s bound to be an outlier amongst them.
‘…Regardless, it’s not something I need to worry about right now.’
I pushed away my anxieties about the distant future. While I’m under the Royal Family’s jurisdiction for now, I’m not going to dedicate my life to serving the king.
Since I’ve entered the labyrinth, focusing on what’s right in front of me is more than enough.
So, I’ll—
“We’ll be departing in five minutes. Prepare yourselves!”
The rest period, a welcome respite, was over. We’ll soon be heading to the heart of enemy territory, so it’s best not to linger.
“Goodbye, you wretched sled!”
I stored the sled and the supply boxes in my dimensional space and distributed the potions, scrolls, and various other combat consumables stored in my dimensional space to each team.
With that, we’re ready to resume our journey.
Click, click.
By the time it was time to depart, everyone had already taken their positions in the formation. At first, they seemed like a bunch of Tang Dynasty soldiers, but now they look more like an elite force.
“Depart!”
The journey through the 8th floor to reach the Dark Continent was uneventful. As long as we avoid the rifts, the 8th floor is a safe zone with no monsters, and the portal was within sight from the hill.
Thud, thud, thud.
We reached our destination after roughly 30 minutes of walking.
“Once we cross this portal, we’ll be in the Dark Continent, right?”
I could see the portal from afar, and even up close, there was nothing unusual about it. It was a relief. If the Noark bastards had left the 8th-floor portal open, we’d be stuck here, twiddling our thumbs.
‘…Well, even if no one hunted here, someone would’ve opened it for the EXP.’
As I took the lead toward the portal, maintaining our formation, everyone gulped. It’s understandable why they’re tense. We’re entering Noark’s territory, after all.
“Suiz.”
Kaislan spoke to me as I was about to step through.
“It’s not too late to give them a motivational speech before we leave. Your words would be a huge boost to the expedition’s morale.”
Hmm, not really in the mood. It feels like a waste of time.
When I gave him a noncommittal response, Kaislan panicked and quickly added, “Think about it. It’s a historic moment, isn’t it? If this expedition is successful, and you play a key role in our victory… everything you say will be documented and passed down for generations.”
Well, I’m not sure if this is a historic moment. 
Seeing his eyes ablaze with an unquenchable thirst for glory, it’s clear he’s envious of me.
‘If I ignore him, he’ll keep whining about it…’
Sigh. Maybe I should just throw something together.
“Ahem.”
I cleared my throat, and Kaislan straightened his back like a royal guard. In a solemn tone, he declared, “Hear me, comrades! We stand at a crucial juncture. Will we fail or succeed? Will we lose everything or gain it all? There may be those who doubt and fear!”
“…”
“But!”
“…”
“I, Meland Kaislan, have no doubt that we will be recorded in history as victors!”
“Wooo!!!”
While Kaislan’s team cheered enthusiastically, the other adventurers looked unimpressed.
“Who the hell does he think he is, barging in like that?”
He sensed the atmosphere, didn’t he?
“On that note!”
“?”
“Listen closely, everyone! Before we carry out the great task entrusted to us by the Royal Family, Duke Suiz will address you!”
He handed the metaphorical microphone to me, so quickly it was like he’d just taken it from a microwave.
I was flabbergasted. What the hell? He says he wants me to speak but then delivers his own speech and hands me the microphone?
‘…Is he trying to get himself documented?’
I don’t understand his psychology, but I guess everyone’s got their own priorities.  I turned around and looked at the adventurers. Unlike Kaislan’s speech, they were genuinely curious to hear what I had to say.
This is why American CEOs try to garner attention on social media, I guess.  People pay attention out of worry, thinking “What will this person do next?”
Anyway, that’s not the point.
“Ahem.”
I cleared my throat and quickly scanned the crowd. I saw the faces of the adventurers, all so familiar now after the countless days we shared on this expedition. 
Perhaps that’s why…
The perfect words came to me.
“I won’t be saying much this time.”
Right.
I’ve already said it once before: “Kill more, get richer.”
“Let’s all make it back alive.”
That should be enough for today.
***
“You’ve entered the 7th-floor Dark Continent.”
***
The Dark Continent’s late-game field, “Dragon’s Lair.” Surrounded by gigantic, fossilized vertebrae, the landscape resembled a vast, prehistoric graveyard. The ground was littered with skulls and bone fragments.
Scritch, scritch.
I carefully moved through the field, concealing my presence as much as possible.
“…”
Silence reigned among the adventurers.
Scritch.
Even the light used to illuminate the area was suppressed. However, this didn’t significantly affect our visibility. We’ve got magic to handle the darkness.
“Riard Ashid has cast the 5th-grade supportive magic [Insight].”
It’s a 5th-grade supportive magic. The magical expenditure would be immense if used constantly, but there’s no way around it. We’re in enemy territory, aren’t we?
We need to be extremely cautious in our movements—
Click.
Amelia, who had been leading the way from the very beginning, since the 7th floor, abruptly halted. Then…
Whirr, whirr.
She quickly made hand signals. It meant there were enemies nearby.
The leaders immediately joined the front, and instantly activated the “voice control” magic.  In other words, they activated team voice chat.
“How many enemies?”
“Fifteen.”
Hmm, a small clan unit. You need a decent-sized group to explore these parts.
“What should we do? Do we engage in combat?”
“Of course, we attack. They’re a threat to the Kingdom. Engage them!”
“I agree with Kaislan. The glory doesn’t matter to me, but it’s safer to reduce their numbers gradually.”
The team leaders reached a consensus in an instant, deciding to ambush the enemies we had found. 
As the captain, I didn’t have any objections either. However…
“Alright, let’s get moving.”
“Hold on. If we’re going to ambush them, we should prepare a little more. If the mages and psionics unleash their combined firepower, we can take them down more efficiently.”
“Oh, you’re right. We should have our team in the lead, considering this is our first encounter.”
What are they going on about? Why are they taking this so seriously?
“Do you guys even know what an ambush is?”
“?”
The team leaders tilted their heads and looked at me.
Geez, they’ve probably killed a lot of people. Have they never tried ambushing anyone first?
“Hold it right there, mages and whatnot. We’re waiting.”
“What are we waiting for?”
Of course, I know! 
“We wait for them to fight the monsters, then we attack from behind.”
That’s the basic rule of PK.
