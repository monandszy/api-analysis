## The Evil Spirit’s Sanctuary (3)
I picked up one of the paintings hanging on the bookshelf and examined it. The picture was thin and unframed. It was coated with a thin layer, as if it had been magically treated or coated, like a modern photograph. 
“Who is this?”
The woman in the vibrant painting was dressed in an elegant gown. While not a legendary beauty, she was a very charming woman with a bright smile.  Her distinctive feature was her black hair and black eyes, a combination rare in this world. 
The face seemed familiar somehow. Where had I seen it before? I was absorbed in the painting, trying to place the woman, when another painting, this one featuring a woman in a revealing outfit, provided the answer. 
“This woman… looks exactly like Ragna.”
Black hair, black eyes.  Even if I disregarded those features, the outline of her face and everything about her looked exactly like Ragna. 
“Could she… be Ragna’s mother?”
There wasn’t any clear evidence, but it was a reasonable assumption, given the circumstances. After all, Ragna’s middle name, “Ritanyel,” belonged not to her mother, but to her nanny. 
“And her mother? Do you know what happened to her?”
“I heard she passed away on the day I was born.”
Ragna, the Viscount’s illegitimate child.
And a woman who looked exactly like her, discovered in the Viscount’s secret study.
“If he made a room like this… he must have truly loved Ragna’s mother.”
I surveyed the paintings again, then abandoned them and searched other parts of the room.  There was nothing of interest on the desk except writing tools, so I focused on the bookshelves.
“Royal Council Records 17-18”
“02 Year Explorer Status Report”
“11th Racial Council Minutes”
“Maze Progress Plan Draft IV, Year 117”
“217th Dimensional Collapse…”
“…”
What were these books? They didn't look like regular books at all.  I opened one and found it wasn’t a publication, but a public record. The Council Records contained every word spoken during the meeting, and the plans and reports were the kind submitted by workers to their superiors. 
“Why would the Viscount collect these?”
I flipped through the books, skimming the contents. A few passages were underlined. For instance, in the “11th Racial Council Minutes”:
“All racial leaders bowed their heads in respect before the imposing figure of the Immortal King, kissing the floor.”
That passage was underlined. And in “Maze Progress Plan Draft IV, Year 117”: 
“Current explorer growth trends are progressing much faster than anticipated, so the Maze Management Department is likely to need to create a separate alternative plan.”
“Hmm…”
As I scanned the books for more underlined sections, I noticed a set of smaller books on the lower shelf, attached to the desk. 
“A diary?”
My deduction was simple.  First, these books were much smaller than the others.  There were many of them. And most importantly, the year was written on the spine of each one.
“If it’s a real diary… this would be amazing.”
Excited, I grabbed the oldest diary and opened it.  But then, a bizarre sight met my eyes. 
“…”
The pages were filled with writing, but I couldn’t read a single word. It wasn't just bad handwriting. 
“This isn’t even Laphdonian or Ancient Laphdonian?”
It was a script I’d never seen before.  It wasn't Hangul or English either.  What language was it?
These questions filled my mind. Then, I had a realization. 
“Oh, maybe it’s a cipher?”
Even in modern times, each country used its own cipher during World War II.  I’ve heard that some units in the Laphdonian Army have their own “cipher”.
“I’ll take it with me, for now.”
This could be helpful later. I quickly stashed it in my interspatial bag.
“Nothing else to see here.”
Satisfied that I had examined everything, I approached the only framed painting in the room.  It featured a woman’s name.
“Mayrin Huenbenia ——————”
For some reason, her last name was scratched out, making it impossible to read.  Beneath the name were a series of numbers, presumably her birthdate and time of death.
“What is this symbol?”
There was a symbol similar to the Taegeuk pattern in the lower left corner of the painting.  It was a sphere formed by the combination of red and blue. 
“Could it be… that this bastard Viscount is also an evil spirit?”
The thought crossed my mind, but I dismissed it as unlikely.  While the colors were similar, the symbol differed from the Taegeuk pattern I knew.
“Whew…”
It seemed I had seen everything I needed to. It was time to leave. I turned to go, but then. 
Kwaa-aa-aa-a-a-ng-!
What was that sound?  Had the Viscount already sent a military unit after hearing about my presence?  I couldn’t be sure, but I definitely heard it.
“Aaaa-ack!”
A scream. And the fact that I heard it meant something had gone wrong above.
Tada-da-da-da-da-t-!
I hurried out of the secret room and ran up the stairs.
Taa-t-!
As I reached the top of the stairs, I found myself facing a dozen figures in a standoff with my special forces team.  And, to my surprise, I recognized several of them. 
“Seems there was a bit of a variable, wasn’t there.”
The man spoke in a monotone, his eyes fixed on me. 
“It’s Bjorn Jandel again.”
The Vice Captain of Orcullis.
The Eye, Roland Vanosant.
Next to him stood.
“This is so weird. How did my brother find out we were hiding here?”
An Orcullis member.
The Screaming Witch, Rilannah Vivian.
And then there was a member standing awkwardly behind them. 
“This is a bit of a predicament.”
“Pish-sit……”
The Corpse Collector, Avet Necrapeto.
“Looks like the rest of them are Orcullis members too.”
I’d completely destroyed the Viscount’s mansion to locate any Noirarc members who might be hiding inside, so I was completely shocked.  
“Wait, why are these guys here? What are they doing here?”
Was this actually happening?
***
My arrival brought the standoff to a standstill.  
“Aaaaaack……”
The silence was broken only by a scream from one of my soldiers, who had lost an arm while I was gone. 
“Raven.”
I whispered her name, and she quickly filled me in. 
“While you were gone, we inspected the room and found a hidden door in the floor. We opened it, and these people came out.”
Right.  I could picture the events that took place while I was away, but it still didn’t feel real.  I was only hoping to “legally” loot the Viscount’s mansion, and never expected to actually find these people.  
It seems they were as surprised as I was. 
“Randolph, didn’t you say the Viscount’s mansion was safe from searches?”
The Vice Captain sounded accusatory.  Randolph, the bespectacled man, scratched the back of his head awkwardly, and chuckled nervously. 
“Haha… you’re right. I’d calculated that the likelihood of this happening was 0%.”
0% my ass.
You’re old enough to know that there’s no such thing as a 100% guaranteed outcome.
Suddenly, the Vice Captain’s gaze shifted to his comrades. 
“It’s clear that information was leaked from inside.”
Huh.
Is that how this works?
“Death awaits traitors.”
My head was still spinning from the situation, but I was a seasoned veteran, always ready with a solution.  I blurted out the first thing that came to mind. 
“Necrapeto, you’re coming with us. We’ll protect you from now on.”
He had no idea what I was talking about.  But then. 
“You’re right! Thanks to you, we found them. This is a huge contribution.  You can have a new identity in the city…”
I quickly continued, but then.
“W, w, w, w, w, w, what kind of nonsense is this?!”
Necrapeto finally grasped the situation, his eyes wide with panic. He waved his hands frantically.  
“No, no, no, no, no! I’m… Vice Captain, this guy’s just talking nonsense! You wouldn’t believe him, would you? You, with the Eye that sees the truth?”
But the Vice Captain didn’t respond, so Necrapeto pressed on. 
“I could rip that guy to shreds a hundred times over!  You… really believe him?”
“…Of course I don’t believe him.”
“Whew…”
“But seeing you panic and stammer like that, I’m starting to wonder.”
The Vice Captain’s words carried a lot of weight, even if he intended them as a joke.
“Yes, if someone hadn’t leaked information, we wouldn’t be in this situation.”
Randolph chimed in, and Necrapeto’s eyes bulged even further. 
“Just to be clear, I have nothing to do with this guy.”
Vivian, who usually called him “brother,” also drew a line, and Necrapeto was clearly about to lose it. He seemed heartbroken by how unfairly he was being treated.  
But that wasn’t my concern.
“See, you should’ve behaved yourself.”
I’m not the only one.  Do you really think our comrades would just stand by if he said something like that? They’d never blink an eye.
“I said, you’re coming with us.  Hurry up.”
“W, why should I go with you?”
“Why are you acting like this? There’s no need to lie anymore.”
“I’m not saying nonsense!”
“Are you afraid of betraying your comrades in front of their eyes?”
“Wh, what are you—!”
He was so enraged that he took a step forward, as if he might charge at me.  But I didn’t have to stop him. 
Someone else had already stepped in. 
Cha-cha-cha-t.
The bespectacled man, Randolph, moved quickly, cutting off Necrapeto before he could reach me. 
“…”
Necrapeto was visibly shocked by Randolph’s intervention. 
Randolph spoke in a businesslike tone.
“Stop your rash behavior. Acting like that makes it look like you’re trying to escape.”
“No, no, no! It’s not like that. I was just going forward…”
“You wouldn’t have any reason to approach the enemy during battle, especially if you’re Necrapeto.”
“I wasn’t… I, I wasn’t really planning to fight…”
“Aha.  So you weren’t planning to fight, is that it?”
“No, that’s not what I meant…”
“Vice Captain?”
Randolph looked to the Vice Captain for confirmation, and he nodded solemnly.
“It’s better to be safe than sorry, especially with someone who’s acting suspiciously. Restrain Avet Necrapeto. Don’t let him do anything else.”
“You heard him. Come with us.”
“But, what did I do wrong—!”
“Yes, yes, we’ll talk about that later. Come with us.  After all, losing Necrapeto won’t affect us much right now.”
Okay, so we’re taking out one person first.
