## Mystery (3)
No. 777, the Makairo's Coffer. 
It was one of the few "consumable" Numbers Items among all the numbered items. Even though it was a consumable item, it felt entirely different from the "Unidentified Statue" or "Dragon's Blood Elixir." 
While those items offered widespread healing or powerful combat buffs upon consumption, those effects were entirely one-time uses. This coffer, however, was different.
"It's kind of like the No. 7,777 Garpas Necklace, wouldn't you say?"
The Makairo's Coffer granted a random item or a permanent buff upon use. Though, there was a small chance of getting nothing at all. 
Regardless.
"We've come across several valuable items on this expedition."
From numerous expensive byproducts to the Siege Slaughterer, and now, this "Mystery Box."
If this were a normal dungeon expedition, finding even one of these items would be considered a lucky break. Yet, we had obtained them all one after another. 
Perhaps this is why humans should explore uncharted territories?
"A random outcome? How exciting! Let's roll the dice already!"
The only downside was that we had to compete with Baekho's team for every loot.
If I had led our clan here, I would have distributed them as I wished. 
"It's been a while since I've rolled the dice. It's fun."
"Baekho… What if we roll them separately this time? I want to roll too.  And you're not exactly known for your good luck, Baekho."
"….Me? My luck's bad?"
"….…"
"Alright, let's roll separately this time."
With the situation settled, we quickly rolled the dice. And…
"Hahaha! If we had rolled the dice for lower numbers, the two of us would have taken first and second place!"
Baekho and I both rolled a 5. Well, that's a combined score.
"Combined 11…. I, I won!"
In short, the GM won the dice roll and claimed the "Mystery Box."
"What are you waiting for? Open it already?"
"He, here, right now…?"
"Wow, are you being rude? You didn't want to open it then?"
"Hahaha! Sir Havellion! Don't hesitate, open it now. We need some fun like this, don't we?"
The GM seemed to want to open it when he was alone, but he eventually nodded, unable to withstand the others' insistence.
"Then… I'll open it."
The GM placed his hand on the box, his expression full of apprehension. 
He kept his hand over it for a while, and then the black, cubic box slowly rose into the air.
"Yurben Havellion has used No. 777, the Makairo's Coffer."
The box levitated, slowly peeling open like a flower blooming.
Whoosh…
Soon, the "item" hidden within was revealed.
"…Armor?"
An armor had appeared.
"Is there such a Numbers Item…?"
An armor I had never seen before.
***
"No. ????, the Aegis' Dragon Armor, is generated."
***
The armor's appearance was rather ordinary. It was a vest-like armor that covered only the torso, lacking any hint of embellishment. 
Its color was a dull gray, closer to ash than iron, devoid of any jewels, engravings, or patterns.
And yet…?
"….It looks like a set item."
It seemed to match the No. 3, the Aegis' Barrier, somehow. The color matched perfectly when I placed them side by side.
"I needed a new armor anyway…"
Currently, I was wearing a lightinium breastplate.  
For now, I had enough stats and wasn't eager to spend money on a new one. I planned to wear the old one until something better came along.
But…
Slobber…
I felt an involuntary saliva drip down my chin.
I knew nothing about the armor's true nature, but…
It came out of a "Mystery Box," so there's no way it could be worse than a breastplate made of lightinium, worth millions of stones—
"Why, why are you looking at it like that…?"
It's not like I can't look at it.
"Can I try it on?"
"….Yes?"
"There's no one else who can wear it, except for me, right?"
"Ah, no? I was also thinking that if I had a suit of armor, it would be good for emergencies—."
Hold on, a mage wanting to wear a full plate armor?
A mage should be wearing something like a chainmail, right?
"So, I'm just saying I want to try it on. Did I say I was going to steal it?"
I leaned closer, my eyes narrowed, and the GM, with a reluctant expression, nodded.
"We need to test the armor's properties anyway."
"Yes… then… you're just trying it on…?"
"Have I ever lied to you?"
It may look like I'm stealing it, but it's not a bad offer for the GM either.
After all, it's an armor of unknown origin. Someone needs to wear it and test its abilities.
"It'll be beneficial for the team if my combat power increases immediately."
The only position that can wear heavy armor is Aureus, but his skill mechanism prevents him from wearing armor.
In other words, it's mine for the taking.
"Character has equipped No. ????, the Aegis' Dragon Armor."
Oh, the feel of it is amazing!
"Overall Item Level increased by +13,600."
It feels much stronger, even if it's just a feeling.
"Two or more Aegis Artifacts equipped."
"Soul Fragments are resonating. (2/3)"
"All regeneration speeds significantly increased."
"The equipment has been bound to the wearer."
"….Huh?"
What is this?
It feels like the armor is suddenly sticking to my skin. 
"Not bad."
Anyway, it doesn't feel unfamiliar at all, even though it's the first time I've worn it. It feels like it's always been a part of me, like my own skin.
"Wow, this Baron just puts on something he doesn't even know. What if it's a cursed item?"
Baekho stared at me with disbelief as I stretched my body like I was doing calisthenics.
But I didn't know what to say.
Because I didn't feel any unease or doubt. It felt like mine from the moment I saw it.
"Anyway, I'll check the stats later, on my own.  Let's keep moving."
"Alright."
I wanted to test the new armor's capabilities, but it would be rude to waste everyone's time for my own sake.
"Come on, let's go.  If there's a time-limit gimmick, it'll be a pain."
I decided to investigate the armor later and searched the room one more time.
However, there was nothing of interest. We then descended the stairs we had climbed earlier.
Thump, thump.
The stairs that took us hours to climb up felt like a breeze to descend. 
As we reached the bottom step, a narrow passage similar to the one we had encountered before appeared, and at the end of it was a golden stone gate.
"….Golden Ruins?"
The GM seemed to have realized what this place was upon seeing the golden stone gate.
"Why are Golden Ruins here…."
"What are you surprised about? It's not like there was anything about this journey that made sense."
"Well… that may be true, but…"
"Hey, I wouldn't be surprised even if another area suddenly appeared beyond this. That's what being an explorer is about."
Baekho, saying so, stood at the forefront and slowly pushed the gate open. And…
"Oh my?"
He stopped, muttering a sound of disbelief.
I approached to see what was going on, and I couldn't help but flinch myself. Like Baekho said, another area didn't suddenly appear, but…
"Why is everything open?"
There was nothing left to conquer beyond the stone gate.
***
The "Golden Ruins" were quite simple to conquer.
Starting from a dense forest, you solve a few missions, and then a temple appears. Entering the temple, you encounter the stair section we were just in.
And…
'The next part is here.'
When you open the golden stone gate and enter the main hall, the real conquest begins.
As a 4-layer rift, belonging to the lower levels, the conquest itself isn't that complicated.
Entering the stone gates located on both sides from the entrance and activating the mechanism, a guardian appears in the main hall, and a treasure room, previously tightly closed, opens…
'The treasure room is open too.'
Furthermore…
"Whoa… what is this dust…."
"It's like we're exploring an abandoned house!"
The entire ruin is covered in a thick layer of dust, and the walls that should be shimmering gold are cracked and broken.
"Let's brighten up the view first. I can barely see anything because it's so dark."
At Baekho's request, the GM summoned several light orbs and floated them in the air. With that, we cautiously explored the surroundings.
"As expected, the treasure room has been emptied."
The first place we searched was the treasure room, which opens after defeating the Rift Guardian, Calpion.
Originally, three Numbers Items were sealed here, and you could choose one from them using a key obtained during the Rift clear process.
However, when we arrived, it was completely empty.
"Which should we check first, the Snake Room or the Mummy Room?"
Thus, the next targets were the left and right gates.  We decided to check the left gate first, where the snake-shaped mid-boss appeared.
'...Even the pieces are gone.'
From the 'Golden Marble,' which appears when you press the lion mural below, to the 'Eagle Candlestick' hidden in the trap room…
We checked every nook and cranny of the maze-like passage, but we found nothing.
The mid-boss room, where the lever mechanism was located, was similar.
"It's eerie that there's absolutely nothing here…."
The lever is turned, and the mid-boss is nowhere to be seen.
Also, the pieces here are gone too.
Unfortunately, the situation was the same for the right gate, belonging to the Mummy Room.
"It seems we've checked everything…."
"Hah! This is quite perplexing!"
We thoroughly searched the entire ruin, but there was nothing to find.
This was a big problem.
We need to find something, so we can either proceed or whatever.
This is how it works in games too.
The real bottleneck isn't encountering a difficult challenge.
It's when you don't even know what you're supposed to do.
That's when gamers get lost and waste time.
Just like now.
"I'm going to investigate the stairs…."
"Me too. I'm going to check if there are any hidden passages in the walls."
Being top-tier explorers, they didn't lose hope and found their own tasks, but it wasn't very meaningful.
One day, two days, three days, four days…
As time passed, there were truly no more places left to search, and as a result, anxiety and unease spread among the party.
"….We're not going to be stuck here forever, are we?"
"Maybe they're trying to starve us to death."
"I didn't know they could drive people crazy like this…."
They all muttered weak words, and surprisingly, Baekho was the one who reacted most intensely.
"Damn it, what are you all doing?  We should be looking for a way out instead of resting! What the hell?!"
Baekho snapped at everyone with sharp eyes and a voice laced with anger.
'This guy, is his mental fortitude this weak?'
At least, he didn't show me that kind of attitude. But…
That too didn't last.
"Baron, give me your armor."
"….What?"
"It's true that there's nothing else, right? Since it's something we got here, there might be a way out hidden in the armor."
Her attitude was a bit unpleasant, but…
If you ignore the emotion…
"….That's not wrong."
It was a plausible argument.
