## Escape Plan (2)
Day 63 of the Exploration, 3:00 PM.
We had planned our journey meticulously, arriving at the Human Island a day before the rainy season was set to begin.  Initially, we intended to spend the remaining time hunting around the island, but we altered our schedule and entered the village directly.
"It's just as I heard—truly a village of monsters."
"White, are you sure about this?"
"Didn't the Baron say to keep your wits about you?"
We had already briefed them beforehand, yet the explorers from the Hect Clan still seemed shaken by the sight of the monsters everywhere.  Of course, this was a sentiment exclusive to the Hect Clan.
"A beast that claims to be human…"
"This is... quite valuable."
"Apparently, if you speak the Ancient Tongue, you can communicate with them."
"Haha! I've always said, a vast labyrinth with not a single intelligent being capable of speech is a colossal waste of space!"
The members of the Armin Expeditionary Force, whose veins ran with the blood of explorers, expressed more curiosity than fear towards the monsters.  Naturally, the trio of mages were the most enthusiastic.
"We're staying here until the rainy season passes, yes?  I'd love to try speaking with them if I get the chance."
"Damn it, I should've studied the Ancient Tongue more seriously."
"Don't worry.  I plan to record all our conversations and create translations afterward.  This is an unprecedented discovery in the long history of the labyrinth!"
Indeed, from their perspective, the Human Island's monsters would feel like aliens.  Some would feel fear, others would be consumed by the desire to learn.
"I'll be going on alone from here.  You all stay put.  Emily, you can lead them, right?"
"No problem."
Leaving the rest of the group waiting in the houses they were assigned by the village chief, I walked alone to his home.
"Thank goodness.  You returned in time."
"Worried?"
"Of course.  After waiting all these years, finally."
Despite the circumstances, the village chief's voice lacked any emotion. It felt like talking to a machine.  But I'd seen the monster who'd become friends with Ainar—it didn't seem like all monsters were incapable of emotional expression.
"Anyway..."
The village chief finally spoke.
"It seems your companions have increased since we last met.  How did this happen?"
He must've heard the villagers talking about the increase in our numbers during our journey here.
"Well, it appears that even though we are here, time continues to flow outside."
"So, you're saying that time passed and new explorers entered the labyrinth?"
"Yes."
I nodded while voicing my own doubts.
"But you don't seem surprised."
"Isn't it already proven by you that time flows outside the labyrinth?"
Well, that's true.
But now that I think about it, a question comes to mind.
"Welcome, indeed.  Surely you are an explorer from Raphdonia?"
That was the very first question he asked me when we first met on this island.
"Yes.  How much time has passed outside?"
He must've already known that time flowed differently here.  If not, he wouldn't have asked that question.
"The more I think about it, the more suspicious this old man seems…"
I kept these doubts to myself.  Right now, I needed his strength and knowledge.  If he really had an ulterior motive, he wouldn't have answered honestly even if I asked directly.
"So, what happened outside the island?"
He asked, and I summarized what had happened.  I started with exploring the Wooden Island, then the Rock Island and the explorers we met there. I told him about rescuing the explorers on the Giant Island, the portal monolith found in the cave, and the colossal giant we saw as we left that island.
"...You've found much in such a short time."
The village chief made a non-exclamatory statement of admiration and asked.
"But why did you suddenly return to the Rock Island?"
A question I'd expected.  I had omitted the story about the Evil Spirit when recounting the past events.  There had to be a hole in my narrative.
"Chief, after carefully considering your words, I realized that time also flows outside.  I went there just in case.  Besides, we had reached a dead end exploring the Wooden Island."
"Hmm... I see."
He accepted my prepared excuse without any further questioning.  That was the end of our information sharing.
He then steered the conversation to another topic.
"A non-functioning monolith… Perhaps it holds the key to escaping this place.  What are your plans next?"
"Ah, about that..."
Before answering, I brought this up first.
"Chief, we had a deal. You'd help us explore, and we would share any information we found in return."
"Yes, we did, didn't we?"
He seemed confused as to why I was suddenly bringing this up.  He wouldn't just be nice to me for no reason.
I smirked and said.
"I need your help from now on."
The first step in the escape plan.
"My help...?"
We needed to become stronger.
***
The need for a power-up became acutely apparent immediately after leaving the Giant Island.  After all, we had seen that colossal giant at the end.
"Considering how the difficulty has exponentially increased... I need to keep in mind that the Library Island and Wooden Island may also have such monstrous bosses waiting at the end."
Of course, it was just a possibility.
Still, that giant undoubtedly served as the boss of the island.  The portal monolith was also discovered on that island.
Based on my years of playing "Dungeon & Stone," that giant is highly likely to hold the key to escape.
However…
"I need time to think about this."
He gave a lukewarm response.  Despite being trapped here for eons, he must be eager to leave just as much as we are.
"The rainy season starts tomorrow, so give me your answer before then."
"Understood."
That topic was put on hold for now.  The conversation moved on to less important subjects.
"With so many more people, that one house might be a bit cramped.  I'll arrange a new place for you all to stay by tomorrow. Bear with me until then."
"It's just for a day.  We're used to sleeping on the bare ground, so we won't mind the discomfort."
"That's good to hear."
"By the way, where did those guys go?"
"If you're referring to the Silver Lion Clan, they left the island shortly after you did.  And they haven't returned yet."
Hmm... is that right?
The rainy season will start soon.
"I wonder if they went to some strange island and got wiped out."
It wouldn't be surprising, considering their capabilities.  Even we started actively recruiting members because we felt short-handed for the end-game content.
"I intend to wait as long as possible.  Once the rainy season begins, I'll lock the village gates immediately."
"That's only natural."
There was a chance that they were on their way back to the island, so I decided to end the discussion about the Silver Lion Clan.
Then...
"Anything else you want to talk about?"
"No.  Let me know your decision regarding what I said today."
"I will."
We had covered everything, so we headed back to the lodging where the rest of our group was staying.  What was once spacious during the last rainy season now felt like a refugee camp.
Well, it was natural, considering we'd gone from seven to 39 members.
"Hect, Muel.  Bear with it a little longer. The chief said he'll arrange a place for us to stay by tomorrow."
"That's good to hear."
While White Hect, whose priority was survival, simply expressed relief, Armin was different.
"I don't care about the lodging.  But... I've heard something about the chief…"
"What?"
"Is it true that this chief is the dragon knight, Cornelius Bruengrid?"
"...Who told you that?"
Muel flinched at my question, fixing his gaze on a particular spot.  Ainar, sitting at the end of his gaze, avoided my eye contact.
"Sigh..."
It's my fault, isn't it?  I hadn't explicitly told them to keep it a secret this time.  If I had, Ainar wouldn't have blabbed.
As I sighed, Muel quickly tried to protect Ainar.
"I apologize.  I shouldn't have asked."
"It's alright.  There's no need to hide it anyway.  The truth is...  what you heard is partially correct."
"Partially...?"
"Yes.  He claims to be Bruengrid, but it hasn't been officially verified."
"I see..."
Since we're already at it, I decided to hear Muel's opinion.  This old man had been searching for the labyrinth's secrets for almost his entire life.  He might know something.
"Muel, what do you think?  Do you think that claim is true?"
"Well… I haven't met him personally, so I don't know.  However, if it's true, one thing bothers me."
"What is it?"
"The part where he is currently possessing a monster's body and enjoying eternal life."
"Why?"
"The Great Sage's life story is famous, but… there are surprisingly few records about his companions.  At one point, I was curious about their private lives and diligently collected their records, but—"
"Alright, get to the point."
"Once, I found a record about Bruengrid at an antique market."
"What was it?"
"Before I tell you, let me be clear.  After analysis, I confirmed that the record was written during that time period.  However, the authenticity of the record itself remains inconclusive."
I told you to get to the point.
"Of course it would.  So, what was the content?"
I pressed again, and Muel Armin cautiously opened his mouth.
"It stated that the dragon knight, Cornelius Bruengrid, was obsessed with eternal life and constantly clashed with the Great Sage because of it."
An ancient secret, whose authenticity I wasn't even sure of, told to me for the first time by Muel.
But why?
"Eternal life…"
Why do I feel so uneasy all of a sudden?
***
Day 64, 9:00 PM.
The village chief visited our lodging.
He had two things to tell us.
One was that he had prepared a new place for us to stay, solving the housing problem we had because of the cramped space...
"I've decided to accept your proposal."
And the second was that he had finally made his decision.
After hearing about eternal life, I had a strange feeling about the chief, but I didn't mention it.  Confronting him at this point wasn't wise.  It was better to get what I wanted first and then investigate later.
So...
"All the village warriors are ready."
He left with us, accompanied by the village warriors he had mobilized.
The reason was simple.
Floor 1, Record Vault.
Escaping from here is beyond our capabilities at this point.  We needed to get stronger.  And hardship is a necessary part of human growth.
"We have about two hours left.  Let me know if you change your mind.  There's nothing stupider than facing a catastrophe with bare hands."
"My mind won't change, no matter what."
He spoke as if persuading me, but I wouldn't budge.
Then, how much time had passed?
"..."
Almost 300 troops, including the village warriors, stood ready with solemn expressions.  
Finally, that time had arrived.
"Woof!"
"Grr, grr, grr..."
"Woof! Woof! Roooaaaar!"
Howls of countless monsters resonated from above, harmonizing as one.
Crack!
Monsters slammed into the hard ground, headfirst, disintegrating into light.
Whoosh-!
From that dazzling spectacle, the surviving monsters, their bodies battered and bruised, charged at us.  The waiting explorers and monster warriors unsheathed their weapons and met them head-on.
And...
"Catastrophe my ass."
I raised my shield high and roared.
"Behe—laaaaaaar!"
Rainy season.
This event, where monsters rained down from the sky, was like a catastrophe.
But as I expected, this event was exactly as I planned.
"Killed the Rituere Amulet Magician. EXP +4"
"Killed a Werewolf."
"Killed a Wall Bat."
"Killed an Akeletas. EXP +5"
"Killed an Underground Dragon. EXP +4"
"Killed an Iantrole."
"Killed an Orc Warrior."
"Killed a Garrison Guard..."
"..."
"..."
Monsters that rarely appeared in rifts, hidden fields, or even general fields were raining down from the sky.
"Your character level has increased."
"Soul Power +30."
"Maximum absorbable essence increased by +1."
If this isn't a burning event, then what is it?
