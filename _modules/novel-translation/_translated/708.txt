## Chapter 708: Summoning Order (3)
After the selection of the vice-captain, I had a private meeting with Versil Goulard. As the captain, I had some things to say.
"Well, congratulations. You’ve finally gotten your hands on power," I said with a chuckle.
"Don't be ridiculous," Versil replied.
I was just trying to lighten the mood, since she seemed so overwhelmed by the vice-captain position. It's natural for someone in the number two spot to be serious.
"Versil Goulard," I said, calling her name.
"Yes, Captain?"
"From today onward, you are the vice-captain of our clan. When I'm not here, you must lead the clan in my place. Everyone will help you, but ultimately, you are the one who must make the decisions, and you are also the one responsible for the results."
"I understand..."
Her expression suggested she wasn’t simply giving a rote answer. 
That reassured me. 
I knew Versil would never compromise and would diligently fulfill her duties as vice-captain.
'No need for a long speech,' I thought.
I decided to scrap the advice I had prepared. 
Someone who already understands the gravity of the situation doesn't need anything more than trust and encouragement.
"You will do well," I affirmed.
"..."
"Let’s go, everyone’s waiting," I said, ending the meeting with a few pats on her shoulder. Then, I returned to the rest of the clan members and started the real discussion.
Actually, ‘discussion’ might be too formal. 
To be honest, it was more like criminals coordinating their stories before a police interrogation.
"With the preparations we made, this part shouldn't be a big problem," Versil said.
"Preparations?" I asked.
"Since we didn’t know how long it would take to return, I purposely leaked some information before we left. I told everyone that the clan was going on a special training retreat," she explained.
The idea that the entire clan was going on a special training retreat for over two months would seem suspicious to anyone, but what could they do when we said it was true?
In fact, many clans do similar things, utilizing private training facilities built underground. 
While using ‘skills’ in the city without permission is illegal, official training grounds are exposed to public scrutiny.
Most clans use private training facilities to practice strategy and tactics, and the city tacitly allows it, as an unwritten rule…
"Honestly, it doesn't matter what explanation we give. As long as we answer the summoning order promptly, they won't have any grounds for interrogation. It’s not illegal for us to be anywhere for two or three months, right?" Versil said.
That was the logical argument.
This city respects freedom, as long as taxes are paid and laws are obeyed.  You can do whatever you want behind closed doors. 
The key is to avoid getting caught leaving the city walls.
'Okay, that part is settled…' I thought.
The discussion then turned to our future plans.
"This is where your role becomes crucial, Captain," Versil said.
"Me?" I asked.
"Since our clan will have a voice within the military headquarters," she explained.
"You mean, I should try to influence them to place us in a safe rear position?"
"Yes.  Of course, your disposition is the most important factor," she said.
"Disposition?" I asked, confused.
I'm just an ordinary person, you know? 
If anything, I prefer hitting over getting hit—
"There are those who might see this war as an opportunity," Versil continued.
Ah, I understood what she meant.
"They might try to place us in a position where it’s easier for us to gain merit.  Though it may be slightly riskier than the rearguard—" 
There was no need for her to continue.
"Stop," I interrupted, cutting her off. "I have absolutely no desire for that kind of ambition."
"My priority is the survival of everyone, without any major injuries. That’s all I want.  Don’t do anything reckless. Understand?" I said firmly, making eye contact with each member of the clan, as if to drill the point home.
Then…
"Don’t worry, Captain. I understand your intentions completely," Versil replied, meeting my gaze with a determined look.
"Good. That’s all I needed to hear." 
That relieved me somewhat.
***
Finally, we emerged from the sewers and entered the city. 
The streets were empty, as the evacuation had been completed. 
However, as we headed towards the city walls, near the border with Bifron, we began to see people.
"..."
"..."
Not ordinary citizens buying and selling fruit or whatever, but explorers or soldiers—those who lived for ‘struggle’.
They didn’t need much time to start whispering when they saw us.
"Bjorn, son of Yandell."
"That’s the Ananada clan…"
"Rumor has it they were on a training retreat…"
"So, they've just returned and are joining the war effort?"
The explorers didn’t approach and speak directly to us. Instead, they made way for us to pass and whispered among themselves.
Most of them seemed friendly.
"It’s good they’re assigned to the 7th district," one said.
"I’m already feeling reassured, knowing they’ll be defending the front lines with us," another chimed in.
In times like this, the most reassuring thing is ‘strong allies’. 
Even those who would normally have looked at us with jealousy now offered welcoming smiles.
"They’re not the kind to abandon their comrades, are they?" someone inquired.
"I hope their reputation is true."
"The higher-ups wouldn't bat an eye if a thousand of us died. It’s all part of the game," one man said, before another cut in.
"Still, we can be relieved knowing Lord Yandell is here."
It was a natural reaction, when you thought about it.
As a titled noble and former explorer, I was one of a kind in this generation. It was only natural for me to be concerned about the 7th district, where my clan members resided. 
It felt like I had a powerful patron.
"Nia Lapdonia!"
As we walked toward the city walls, a group of knights rushed towards us, having apparently heard the news. They saluted me.
"Greetings, Lord Yandell!"
"Your affiliation?" I inquired.
"I am Mueuln Bail, captain of the 7th Wall Defense Unit, belonging to the 4th Royal Knight Order," he replied.
The knight didn’t bother with pointless inquiries in front of the crowd. 
"If it isn’t an inconvenience, could you please come with me?  The Legion Commander was overjoyed at the news of your arrival."
"Legion Commander? Who is that?"
"It is Lord Eltora Tercelion, Commander of the 3rd Legion."
Ah, the Duke’s son.
Or more accurately…
[My son… Eltora Tercelion is dead. An unnamed evil spirit has taken over his body.]
The evil spirit possessing the Duke’s son. The same one who abandoned us in the Ice Rock expedition.
'With a degenerate like that still as Legion Commander, is there any hope for this country to get back on track?'
"Lord Yandell?" 
"Very well. Lead the way."
There was no way to have a conversation in the middle of the road, with everyone watching us.  I accepted the knight’s offer and headed towards the command headquarters located in the center of the encampment below the city walls.
It looked like they were using the largest inn near the city walls.
"Would the rest of you please wait on the first floor?" the knight said to the others. 
"Versil, come with me. We’ll go up together," I said.
"But… um…"
The knight seemed to want to prevent Versil from entering, but he shut his mouth after I continued.
"She’s the vice-captain of our clan. It would be better if we had a conversation together."
"Yes, this way…," he said, leading us to a room on the third floor. The Duke’s son was there.
"Welcome, Lord Yandell," he said with a haughty air.
Oh, you little shit.
You’ve gotten a bit cocky since the last time I saw you, haven’t you?
"Have a seat," he said, motioning to the sofa.
He acts so arrogant, despite not even having a title, just because he has the position of Legion Commander.
Crack-!
The sofa collapsed beneath me as I sat down, fueled by annoyance.
"I’ll just stand behind you," Versil said, doing as she promised.
The Duke’s son—or rather, that bastard—noticed her presence for the first time and frowned at the knight who had brought us here.
"I told you to let no one in," he said, his voice dripping with annoyance.
"Well, I thought it was important since she's the vice-captain of the Ananada clan," the knight replied. 
"Hm, vice-captain," the bastard said, stroking his chin thoughtfully. I guess I finally understand why middle-management promotions are so quick in small businesses.
Even an empty title like ‘vice-captain’ is better than having none.
"Anyway, the vice-captain and I have nothing to hide from each other, so don't worry about it. Just tell me what you need to," I said. 
"Nothing to hide…?" he echoed, looking back and forth between Versil and me.  His expression was unreadable, but he nodded. 
"Hm, very well. Miss Goulard? Feel free to stay," he said, offering a curt nod.
"Thank you for the consideration," Versil replied.
"Now, tell me… have you been through a lot?" he said with a subtle note of mockery in his voice.
What the hell is this guy talking about?
Didn't he forget about the last time I beat the shit out of him? 
He’s acting like a complete dickhead, now that he’s got a little power.
I wasted no time in getting to the point.
"So, why did you call us here?" I asked, cutting through the bullshit.
"Since the Lord Yandell, who had been missing, has reappeared, how could I not call you here?" he said. "And, of course, didn't you also answer the summoning order?"
"Well, yeah. We were in a secluded location and just found out about the summoning order," I said.
"By secluded location, what do you mean?" he asked, probing for more information.
"It was nothing special. We were on a training retreat at a private training facility," I said.
It was a suspicious answer, but in the noble circle, outright questioning someone like that is considered an enormous offense.
"Ha-ha, really?" he said, trying to cover his skepticism with a laugh. 
As expected, the bastard didn’t say anything else, so that topic was finished.
"There’s something I need to ask though. I’ve never been in this kind of situation before.  Can you tell me what happens next?" I asked.
"Ah, well, your situation is a bit unique, Lord Yandell," he said, his words laced with thinly veiled mockery.
"It seems I’m a bit out of the loop," I said, playing along.
"First, due to the Explorer Special Act, all of the Ananada clan members will be temporarily incorporated into the 3rd Legion.  You will be under our command."
"What about me?" I pressed.
"You will be temporarily incorporated into the Military Headquarters in Cardon and then assigned a position. Most titled nobles are transferred to the rear Strategy Department, but sometimes, they are deployed to the front lines."
"Oh, so it’s possible?" I said, surprised.
"It’s possible if the noble in question wants to, or if their skills are needed at the front."
It was a detail I hadn’t heard from Kaislan.
"So, I can stay here with the 3rd Legion?"
"Hm, then you would have to follow my orders.  Are you okay with that?"
"I don’t care."
"Well, then, I’m happy to hear it… but it’s best to go to the Military Headquarters directly to discuss this. I don’t have the authority to incorporate Lord Yandell, a titled noble, into my legion."
Ah, so I’ll have to make a detour to Cardon for a bit.
"They’ve already contacted the Military Headquarters.  Just go there directly. There’ll be someone waiting," he said.
"Alright, but what the hell happened here? I rushed over here as soon as I heard the news, but I haven’t gotten any information yet," I asked, trying to sound casual.
"Well…  Where do I even begin? In short, the Noark forces that had occupied Bifron have come out on their own.  They marched towards Cardon, and we mobilized all our troops to stop them.  We successfully pushed them back to Bifron using magical weapons, and that’s what happened today," he explained.
"Magical weapons?"
"Ah, you wouldn’t know that, Lord Yandell, since you’ve never been in the military. They are, in a way, the true power of our Royal Family.  They say that if one is fired, it can split the heavens and shake the earth.  I saw it for myself, and it’s no exaggeration," he said.
Like, some kind of nuclear missile that the Royal Family has?
I didn’t have a clear picture from his description, but…
'Was that the vibration I felt underground?' I wondered. 
I couldn’t shake this feeling of unease.  It was like an onion, where you keep peeling layers and finding more secrets. If the Royal Family is considered ‘the enemy’, then I’m in for a very difficult time. 
Of course, there was one positive aspect.
'If they’re this powerful, then they should be able to handle the Noark guys,' I thought.
Maybe the ‘incident’ recorded in the memory stones refers to this present situation.  Maybe the Royal Family will easily defeat and wipe out the Noark forces, restoring peace to the world.
'…That’s a bit too optimistic, isn’t it?' I thought.
If not for the goblin's intuition, I would be clinging to that hope and taking a bit of a break.
"Ah, the Military Headquarters is calling.  They seem to be asking you to come to Cardon right away. Take the military magic circle; someone will be there."
"Alright," I replied.
The bastard stood up, acting as if he were my superior.
"Is there anything you want to ask or say before you go?" 
Ah, yes.
"Of course there is," I said.
I’d been wanting to say this before I left.
"Eltora Tercelion."
I approached him and whispered in his ear.
"I know what you did in the Ice Rock expedition."
He had abandoned us as the commander of the front lines, whether on the Duke's orders or for some other reason.
"!"
He seemed surprised, as he hadn’t expected me to call him out in front of him. 
I continued, ignoring his reaction.
"So, do your job well." 
"…"
"There’s no second chance."
