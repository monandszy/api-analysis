## Destination (1)
The goddess had delivered a prophecy in the form of a precognitive dream. It revealed that I would die in the near future, killed by the very exploration force I had come to trust. 
My heart, a warrior's heart, pounded violently, sensing impending danger. Yet, I remained calm, first seeking confirmation.
“Are you sure?”
“…Yes?”
“I mean, are you absolutely sure I die in that dream?”
It was a cliché, at least in modern media. 
Hadn't we all seen it before? 
A protagonist seemingly shot dead in a heart-wrenching scene, only to emerge from the ashes, revealing bulletproof armor and a happy ending.
“I don't know for sure,” replied the young man cautiously, his voice laced with uncertainty.
“Even when I sprayed countless potions on the Baron's body, even after he closed his eyes, the potions didn't react.”
Potions wouldn't work…?
This was a little troublesome.
Could I… truly die…?
To be honest, it felt unreal. My mind was simply a tangled mess.
What should I do?
One solution immediately sprang to mind: deceive him, just as I had deceived Amelia’s sister. 
But, even then, a lingering question gnawed at me.
If this was a prophecy I could easily evade, why would the goddess reveal it in a divine revelation?
No, the real question was… why was this happening?
Was the exploration force not aiming to bring me back alive?
Ugh, what a bolt from the blue, first thing in the morning— 
“…Baron!”
The young man urgently shook me, interrupting my troubled thoughts.
“Didn't you hear? This is no time to stand around! You need to run!”
“Run…?”
“The goddess said it herself. This is not a predetermined fate. The future lies in our hands.”
It meant the future could be changed, depending on our efforts. 
“Why are you only telling me this now…?”
“Um…? I… I don't know either…?”
Ugh, he should've told me this first!
Now I understand why he gets scolded all the time.
Anyway, since it's not a predetermined fate, it means the fate stones aren't involved.
I quickly assessed the situation.
Leathralas is one of the three deities who represent this world. And since she said so, it must be true that the future can be changed.
This changes everything.
See? It's not as bad as I thought.
Just a ‘Fate Tracker’ red alert, right?
It means a negative event will occur, but if it's something that can be altered, I can definitely overcome it.
Right, so… 
“Thank you for letting me know. But, I’m staying here.”
I politely declined Parav’s advice to flee.
The reason was quite simple.
“I'll handle this myself. You just tell me everything you saw in the dream, no detail left out.”
Because running away has never solved anything.
