## Coming Out (2)
Ragna Ritaniel Peprock. The illegitimate child of the Chancellor, Duke Tercesrion of Lapdonia. Well, the name ‘Ritaniel’ is omitted in the name I actually use now, but anyway.
“You don’t look good. I heard you were quite the beauty.”
Well, I know that. But that’s not the issue now. It’s not just about this marriage proposal causing unnecessary awkwardness between friends.
“Countess Peprock is the Chancellor’s illegitimate child.”
“I’ve already confirmed that. The Chancellor made a bold move. It just shows how impressive your growth has been.”
“Despite that, you think I should marry her? The moment I get married, a leash will be around my neck, unseen but undeniably present.”
“You don’t have much choice. Imagine what would happen if the Chancellor actively starts to obstruct you.”
Obstruct me… I didn’t need to imagine deeply, countless sabotage plots were already painted in my mind.
The reconstruction project in the 7th Ward will be hindered. The Bipron-born retainers will be unable to pay taxes, leading to their mass execution by next year. Maybe the Barbarian hearts will be reclassified as research materials.  Perhaps our warriors will be subjected to stricter inspections and false accusations.
“...”
Seeing my grim expression, the village head spoke, attempting to persuade me.
“Don’t make marriage too sacred. Just bow down for now, and build your strength later.”
This guy is funny. Hearing him talk, I feel a sense of dissonance, to say the least.
“But you…,” I hesitated for a moment, but asked, as I always did, without any sugarcoating. “Why do you keep trying to persuade me?”
“It’s because you—”
“I mean, why are you worried about this? Whether I'm ruined or not, it’s none of your business.”
I asked directly, wanting to know his reason for meddling, and the village head paused before speaking.
“I can’t help but worry.”
“...”
“Because I need you to fulfill my desire.”
It was clear that he was sincere, but understanding him was a whole other story.
“You need me for your desire?”
I don’t know why so many people are seeking me for their desires. I'm honestly curious. What is it that this guy ultimately desires?
“Just tell me plainly. I hate people who play tricks behind my back.”
“I know you have that kind of personality. But it’s not the right time yet.  Just one thing:  you and I might share common interests.”
“Is that so? Then I guess I have no choice but to listen to your opinion.”
My tone was threatening, but the village head was calm, as if he didn’t care.
“Do as you please.  I think marrying the Countess is a better option, but that’s my perspective.  No one knows what the right answer will be when we look back from the future.”
“...”
“More importantly, it’s getting late. If we stay any longer, we’ll surely attract attention.  Let’s end our meeting here for today. I’ll contact you again.”
Following that, the village head truly turned his back and left the garden fountain without a moment’s hesitation.
Whoosh—!
The wind rustled the shrubs, scattering the leaves. I stood there, staring blankly at the fountain, organizing my thoughts.
‘Marriage….’
I didn’t need much time to make a decision.  No, the decision itself was the same one I made at the Dragon Temple.  But…
‘The Duke went so far as to take such a drastic measure….’
To retaliate, I had no choice but to prepare an even bolder move.
‘…Is that really the only way?’
For the first time in a long time, I wished tomorrow wouldn’t come.
***
The next morning, an hour before the Royal Council was scheduled to begin.  I had to get up early, considering the occasion, and quickly finished getting ready.  Just when I was about to leave, 
Knock knock knock.
A visitor came early in the morning. I wondered if it was another street vendor or socialite, like yesterday, and considered ignoring them.
Knock knock knock.
Knock knock knock!
The knocking, spaced out at intervals, grew louder.
‘Who is it?’
I decided I had to see their face, so I flung open the door, only to find a completely unexpected guest standing before me.
“…Hwaak!”
The woman with blue hair yelped in surprise at the sudden opening of the door. Her attire screamed “I’m nobility” from head to toe, but somehow her sleepy eyes lacked any aura of authority. 
The woman I was supposed to be introduced to during the upcoming council.
“Ragna…?”
“…!,”  Ragna flinched, avoiding my gaze.  I could tell why.  I felt the same way.
“...”
“...”
For some reason, it was hard to meet her eyes. I blurted out something, wanting to break the silence before I missed the golden opportunity.
“Long time no see, Ragna. I should have visited you earlier, but I’ve been busy lately.”
“Yes… It’s been a while.  And… it’s fine that you didn’t come. I know you’ve been busy, I heard about it.”
“That’s a relief.”
“...”
“...Shall I invite you in?”
I said it because it seemed awkward to keep her standing outside, but Ragna startled and took a step back. Seeing her reaction, I looked at her curiously.
“No, no! That’s not what I meant…,” she said quickly.  “It’s just, if I go inside, someone might get the wrong idea. It would be bad if rumors started spreading…,”
“What kind of wrong idea?”
“I, just, that! If I go inside, people might think that’s…,” 
We both fell into an awkward silence, the silence we both desperately wanted to avoid.  Thankfully, Ragna broke the silence first.
“Well, actually, I came today because I have something to tell you in advance.”
“Tell me something?”
“You see…,” Ragna hesitated, unable to speak easily.  I could sense what she was about to say. 
“Something unexpected will probably come up at the council. I don’t want you to be surprised, so I thought I should tell you beforehand.  Bjorn Yandel, you and I are both nobles, right?”
“So?”
“When you’re in a position like this, things can progress without your consent...  You know, right?”
She seemed to struggle to say it, and her words became unnecessarily long. I wanted to get to the point, but for the sake of the plan, I had to pretend I didn’t know what she was getting at.
“So, what do you want to say?”
“I, I can’t tell you now. But my father… well, he’s been pushing things forward. S, so whatever you hear at the council, please… please don’t misunderstand.”
“Okay, I understand.  Whatever comes up at the council, I won’t misunderstand.”
“Ah!  Of course, I don’t mean that I don’t want to... You understand, right?”
“I understand.”
“Yes… Good.  I’ll see you later then…,”
I nodded, and Ragna scurried away from the door. Was she really alone? Her familiar, Hyeonbyeol, was nowhere to be seen.
‘I should get going soon.’
I checked the time, then left for the palace, following a servant’s guidance.  
‘…They don’t use a round table here.’
The interior had a long, rectangular table, and most of the seats were empty. This was the tradition of the Royal Council.  Every participant is assigned a number, which serves as their unspoken ranking.  And in my case…
“This is where you’ll be holding the official meeting today, Baron Yandel.”
The furthest seat from the head of the table.
I sat down, and after waiting for about two minutes, another noble entered the room. 
Thud.
He sat down in the seat directly opposite mine.  He was one rank higher than me.  After another two minutes, someone else came in.
‘What kind of nonsense is this…?’
They could all just enter at once, but seeing them enter one by one every two minutes made me want to tear my hair out.  The epitome of inefficiency.
‘The Royal Council’s total capacity is 50, so…,’
If this continues, the person in the last seat will have to sit and wait for almost an hour and a half.  This humiliating last seat… it’s a coveted position for some, I guess.
“...”
“...”
Anyway, as the room started filling with nobles, a heavy silence filled the air, regardless of how many arrived.  I was so bored that I tried to chat with the noble next to me, but he startled and only looked forward.  I gave up on trying to chat.
‘I’ll just get some sleep.’
I leaned back in my chair and dozed off.  Time flew by, and soon the 20s were starting to enter.  And...
‘What the hell is this?’
When I came to my senses, there was a noble man standing there, staring intently at me.
One, two, three, four...
Counting, I realized he was supposed to be the 27th in this council. He looked at my seat and me, then…
“Pfft.”
He sneered, then walked past me.  Of course, I wouldn’t just sit there and take it.
“Hey, wait a minute.”
“...Hey?”
“Ah, my apologies. I can’t remember your name.”
“It’s only natural you would forget, given who you are.  Welcome. I am Count Huteiler.”
“Nice to meet you, Count Huteiler.  But why did you laugh just now?”
“Is there a problem?  I simply laughed because I was happy to see the most famous hero in the city.”
Translated from noble language into regular speech, it meant he was enjoying seeing me, someone everyone praised for being famous and successful, stuck in the last seat.
‘What, he’s just a regular idiot?’
Satisfied with the answer, I coolly nodded.
“Ah, is that so?  Then go ahead.”
If he had some devious motives, I was going to probe him, but if he didn’t, then fine.  It wasn’t worth paying any attention to him.
“Baron Yandel, as a senior, I would advise you—,”
“Ah, I understand.”
“...It would be best to drop that kind of attitude here at the Royal Council.  Or you’ll pay a heavy price.”
I nodded and idly dug at my ear with a finger. Count Huteiler looked at me as if I were crazy, then went to his own seat.
And after some time, the familiar figures started appearing. 
Count Maxiland, the Chancellor’s right-hand man and the 25th in this meeting, whom I’d met at the recent race meeting, first, then…
“...”
Countess Ragna Peprock, 21st, lightly bowed her head when our eyes met, then went to her seat.
Thud, thud.
The village head, 14th, was different. He didn’t even make eye contact with me and sat down silently in his seat.
“It’s a pleasure to see you here.”
Count Kaislan, the older brother of Meland Kaislan and the leader of a relatively large noble alliance, 11th.
“Haha, long time no see, Baron. I heard about you. You made a big contribution this time, too, right?”
Duke Alminus, 6th, someone I’d had a difficult relationship with but who’d taken a photo with me and bought the title ‘long-time friend’ for money.
And...
“The emergence of a new sacred being is always welcome.  Remember, there are always other choices.”
Duke Kearlunas, 3rd, who, as soon as he saw me, left me with those ominous words.
“...”
Chancellor Tercesrion, 2nd, sat down in his seat in a dignified manner, without even acknowledging me with a nod.
The seat for the 1st is empty.  Of course, that’s the king’s seat, which even the Duke, who acts as the king’s representative at all sorts of events, could not occupy.
‘One less seat means a total of 49, right?’
The Chancellor, sitting on the right side of the head of the table, stood up.
“Firstly, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to all of you for attending, on behalf of His Majesty Martanux.”
He began with those greetings, naturally getting all the nobles to stand up, and then, as everyone knows, they bowed to the empty seat.  A ceremony similar to the pledge of allegiance in Korea.
However, since these are nobles, the formal introduction continued for a while. The Noarke invasion, the Bipron incident, and so on.  He discussed the recent events and the current state of affairs, praising the attendees for their contributions. He celebrated the successful completion of the exploration of the 1st floor underground, claiming that it was all thanks to Lapdonia’s blessing.
He wasted time, dragging out pointless talk, and only then began the official meeting.
“Now, let us discuss the first agenda item.”
The first Royal Council had finally begun.
