## Night Companion (3)
Strictly speaking, “we” wasn’t quite right. 
The two-man team of Ttung Ttung-i and Bisil-i weren’t interested in me, but in Erwen.  I nudged Erwen’s shoulder with my foot again. 
“Uuumm…” 
“Uuumm” my foot. Get up. I know you’re awake. I saw you sneak a peek when you heard their voices, then hide your face under the blanket. 
“Kyaat!”
There was no time to waste arguing, so I grabbed her shoulder and forced her up. 
“Why were you pretending to sleep?”
“That’s… ”
Erwen trailed off, avoiding my gaze.  This was a frustratingly evasive attitude, especially since I needed to get information and make a decision quickly. 
Flick.
I gripped her chin and forced her to look into my eyes.  Reluctantly, Erwen finally spoke. 
“If I wake up, you’ll leave… ”
So that was it? 
I had sworn an oath.  If a conflict arose between an explorer and a night companion during their shift, they had to fight together.  Unfortunately, this incident occurred during my final shift. 
Well, I didn’t care about honor, but…
She didn’t know that. 
That’s why she was trying to hold on.  
The moment she opened her eyes, the night companion oath would be over.  
“Huu.”
I let out a deep breath. 
If a grown man like Hans had done this, I would have been furious. But she was barely twenty years old. A feeling of pity welled up within me. 
Of course, that was that, and this was this. 
“What happened with those two?”
“Nothing.”
“Then why were you hiding?”
“…The emblem on their clothes was the same as that of the man who tried to harm me. They must be from the same group.”
A group, huh?  Damn, this situation just got more complicated. 
The thought of just leaving this elf girl and going our separate ways began to creep in.
“Let’s talk while we move.”
“Are you going to help me?”
“After I hear the rest of the story.”
I took Erwen out of the place where she was hiding.  We practically ran, gathering more information as we moved.
“Tell me everything that happened.” 
Erwen, sensing the urgency, relayed only the most important information, concisely.
“On the first day, when I was sleeping, someone I met as a night companion attacked me. Later, I found out he was a high-ranking member of a group that operates mainly on the first floor.”
Incidentally, the group’s name was ‘Crystal Alliance.’
“I managed to escape, but after that, every time someone from the same group saw me, they attacked. That’s how I got injured.”
I paused for a moment.
“Wait, how did they know about that?”
“Message stones.”
Message stones, what the hell are those? My game didn’t have anything like that.
“More details.”
“It’s a magical device that allows you to communicate with other message stones that are already attuned. It’s said to have a range of 300 meters.”
“I see.”
It’s like a walkie-talkie. If you tune to the same frequency, you can communicate within a 300-meter radius.
The situation was starting to make sense.  With such a device and numerous members, even in this closed environment, information could be easily transmitted.
But the real problem was…
“Why are they going to such lengths to chase you?”
Erwen had done nothing wrong. 
So why were they so determined to pursue the victim?
“Could it be a cover-up?”
“…I don’t think so.”
“There’s more?”
“That’s… ”
Erwen hesitated, unsure of how to answer my direct question. This hesitation meant I couldn’t find a way to help her.
Just as I was thinking that, she spoke.
“W, when I escaped, I was swinging a knife around.  And I accidentally hit… ”
“…Accidentally hit what?”
A chill ran down my spine.  I felt a draft brush against my groin.
“T, th, there… ”
It was true, huh.
“Ahem, anyway, from what I heard from the people chasing me, it was completely cut off so they couldn’t even fix it with a potion… that’s probably why… ”
No wonder they were so obsessed.  
“I, I, I’m sorry… ”
There was no need to apologize.
The one who caused it was the guy, wasn’t it?  It was karma.  The problem was that there were too many people in this world who didn’t even understand that simple logic.
“Hey, I think we have pursuers.”
“What?”
“Don’t look back.”
I focused on my hearing, but I couldn’t hear anything.
“They’re about 150 meters behind us.”
It was a distance that would be hard to sense even with senses, but she didn’t seem to be lying.  She had no reason to.  
So was this the elf’s natural perceptiveness?
Suddenly, I saw her in a different light.
“We need to pick up the pace. Can you handle it?”
“Yes. I can still manage for now.”
Even though her bandage was soaked with blood, Erwen didn’t even moan.
Good spirit.  
My mind was in turmoil, though. 
“How far behind are they?”
“…Still about 150 meters.”
Even though we increased our speed, the distance wasn’t closing.
This was not good.
By now, the pursuers must be using message stones or whatever to inform their companions of our location.
We had to take them out.  
If they were targeting me, I would have made that decision.
But I kept running.
Because if I killed them, I couldn’t turn back.
So let’s check before I get too involved.
“Hey… ”
How much risk would I be taking, and what would I gain in return?
I needed more information.
“Erwen.”
“Yes?”
“What are you good at?”
“Laundry, cleaning.  I, I can’t cook very well, but… ”
What the hell was she saying?
“I mean in combat.”
“…Bow, bow!  Oh, and spirit magic!”
A typical elf archer. 
“What’s your element?”
“…Fire.”
Hmm, the most valuable element. 
A picture was beginning to form. 
“Have you ever killed a person?”
“No… But I can.”
Well, we won’t know until we try.  
“I see.”
I asked her one final question.
“Erwen, will you be my companion? We’ll be companions until we get out of the labyrinth.  The loot split is 9 for me, and 1 for you.”
“I, I will!”
Now I had a reason.
***
“—I swear by the name of my clan.”
“I also swear by the honor of a warrior.”
Like before, we made a mark as a symbol of our trust, evolving our relationship from one-night companions to temporary allies.
Of course, while running like hell.
“How far?”
“About 100 meters!”
Despite running at our top speed, they were still closing in.
I made up my mind.
“Let’s head towards the outskirts.”
“Yes!”
We turned and headed into a dark tunnel. 
The glowing crystals on the walls and ceiling grew fewer, and soon, pitch black darkness enveloped us.
My heart was heavy.
Huu, I never thought I’d be back here willingly.
“Erwen, summon your spirit.”
A watermelon-sized ball of fire rose from her palm, illuminating our surroundings.  I watched my feet carefully, moving quickly through the darkness.
And… 
“Dismiss it.”
We hid in the darkness.
“What about their presence?”
“You’ll be able to hear them soon, too.”
“I see.”
I focused on my hearing, maintaining my composure.
The best-case scenario would be for the pursuers to miss us.
Then, I wouldn’t have to kill them, and I could still retreat later.
Tada-da-da-dat—
Soon, I could hear their footsteps too. 
But contrary to my expectations, their steps didn’t just pass us by.
They stopped right where we had turned.
Thud.
Damn it…
It seemed that the guy had a way to track us.  Smell, sound, or maybe something magical.
Thump, thump.
The guy changed direction, walked slowly, and stopped about 30 meters away from us.  At the edge of the abyss-like darkness.
“…”
He tilted his head, peering into the darkness.
We watched him from our hiding place, holding our breath.
“They’re here.”
After sniffing a few times, the guy mumbled to himself.
Then, he pulled something out of his pocket.
It was something I had never seen before, but I instinctively knew what it was.
A message stone.
The moment I saw it, I whispered a signal.
To Erwen, who must have been holding her bow at the ready.
“Shoot.”
Phoo—
Before I could finish speaking, an arrow shot out and struck the man in the middle of his forehead.
Thump.
Even after the man fell to the ground, I didn’t immediately emerge.
“…”
I felt Erwen tremble uncontrollably beside me.
“Well done. You would have been in danger if you hesitated.”
It wasn’t just empty praise, it was genuine.
Had I not hesitated when I slammed my shield into the guy?  Erwen didn’t even have that time.
Even if I didn’t tell her, she must have known.  
That she couldn’t hesitate.
“Yes… ”
“You take a rest for a bit.”
I consoled her, and then emerged from the darkness to search the corpse.
It seemed he had left his backpack with his companions for faster movement, because the pursuer was lightly equipped.
‘To feel regret in a place like this, I’m becoming one of them.’
I stripped the guy’s gear from head to toe, then sorted through each item.  A belt, leather upper and lower clothing, two daggers, a heavy pouch of magic stones, a potion in a pocket tied to the belt, and a message stone.  
“Good haul. Come here.”
After a rough classification, I called Erwen over. 
I removed her bandages and used a potion to heal her wounds.
“Ssssh, ssssh” The wound began to heal with a hissing sound.
“Kuuugh… ”
She could have let out a sound, but Erwen gritted her teeth and endured.
She’s got a tough side to her.  Or maybe her mind is just gone?
I hope it’s the former.  I’m not good with counseling.
“Are you feeling a little better?”
“Yes.  Much better.”
“Then put these on.”
After a few minutes of treatment, I handed her the leather upper and lower clothes I’d just acquired. 
I figured these would be more practical than her fluttering cloth clothes.
“I’ll change right away.”
Did she think following my instructions would increase her chances of survival?  It must have been a little off-putting, but Erwen immediately grabbed the clothes and went into the darkness to change.
“There’s a little extra. Come here.”
I trimmed the hem of the pants and sleeves with my own hands.
“Wear this too. It’ll help.”
They looked a little baggy overall, but when she put on the belt, she looked quite comfortable.
But maybe because she changed clothes, her whole vibe shifted.
Before, she was like an elf girl out for a stroll, but now she looked like a full-fledged warrior.
Even her expression.
“…This feels weird.”
“You’ll get used to it.”
“I gue… ss… ”
“Yeah, you will.”
I stuffed the rest of the loot into my backpack, then dragged the naked body into the darkness and hid it.  
I picked up the message stone.
“How do you use this?”
“Give me a minute.  I’ll try.”
Erwen examined the message stone, then clicked something.
[…The message from Serdin, who was pursuing the elf and the Barbarian, has been cut off. All those who receive this message are to assemble at the Goblin Zone.]
So far, this was all going according to plan.
