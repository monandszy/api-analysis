## Chapter 599: The Third Record (2)
The fifth layer of the Labyrinth, the Great Maelstrom. This layer held a significant, almost monumental meaning for explorers. For it was here that explorers began to form groups, truly operating as clans...
“Their treatment changes.”
For human starts, the fifth layer essentially meant no more tax worries. This is why the residents of Laphdonia consider fifth-layer explorers the best marriage prospects. It's like getting hired by a large corporation, isn't it? In fact, most fifth-layer explorers climb the Labyrinth like it's their daily commute. Upon reaching the fifth layer, they'll continue mining magic stones in their usual hunting grounds until the Labyrinth closes, and then they'll be paid based on their performance. 
Well, there are also many people who don't like that and choose to form their own team instead of joining a clan...
"Those types are like successful self-employed entrepreneurs, I suppose."
Whatever the case, they remain the top candidates for husbands. But...
“It’s quite ironic, isn’t it?”
The preference for marriage partners is highest in the fifth layer, but it actually gradually decreases from the sixth layer onward. Oh, this information comes from the library, by the way. They conducted a survey of over ten thousand residents and compiled it into a book…
The reason for this declining preference is quite interesting. 
1. It's too dangerous. 
2. It's unrealistic to actually meet them. 
3. They probably have weird personalities.
The third reason might seem odd, but it isn't entirely unfounded. Explorers live by a different clock than ordinary people. Their mental state erodes differently, and the stress levels they experience during exploration escalate dramatically from the sixth layer onward. That’s why many famous explorers are known for having eccentric personalities. 
"Baron, what are you thinking so hard about?"
The village chief's voice roused me from my thoughts.
"Oh… I was just checking my surroundings."
It wasn't a lie; I was genuinely looking around. I was lost in thought while observing my surroundings.
The fifth layer of the Labyrinth, the Great Maelstrom. Despite its intimidating name, this layer is relatively safe. But...
“This doesn’t feel quite like the place I know.”
The spot where we woke up was slightly different from the familiar fifth layer we often passed through. The terrain and overall atmosphere were identical, but there was one crucial difference. 
“There's no way a third-grade monster would appear in the Great Maelstrom.”
A third-grade monster was blocking the path down, staring at us with a menacing glint in its eyes.
"Old Man, is that a Bandemon?"
Bandemon. A rare species of monster, difficult to encounter due to its specific spawning conditions. I haven't even gotten to level up using it yet. 
‘I don’t need the essence, and there’s no need to waste our time trying to take it down with just the three of us.’
I was initially quite tense when I saw the creature, but for some reason, it just stared down at us from below and didn't approach. 
"Kahi’en, do you have any idea which way we should go?"
"…No, I have no intuition at all.  It's like my abilities vanished the moment I came here."
Hmm, I see…
“But even so, I can't shake the feeling that this place is our final trial.”
"Oh… Isn't that just wishful thinking?"
"Baron… You’re being a little…  unreasonable.  Well, I can't deny it, but…"
Kahi’en sighed and grumbled.
"It's about time we finished this. We've been here for over half a year already!"
I couldn't offer any consolation, having woken up in chapter 11 right after finishing chapter 2. Besides, my playtime was less than 24 hours.
“Enough. Let’s put our heads together. We need to find that Evil Spirit here, but which way should we go?”
Jerome cut through the tense atmosphere and summarized the situation. Then...
“Of course.”
“It’s a no-brainer.”
Kahi’en and I answered Jerome simultaneously.
What is this? 
“Kahi’en, you go first—.”
“Baron, you go first—.”
We both tried to concede, but our words overlapped again, making things awkward.
“…”
“…”
We were both trying to give way to the other. Should I just speak up? Hmm, what if they're thinking the same thing and we overlap again?
Just as I was hesitating and trying to read the room, I saw my chance.
‘Alright, now!’
I pointed to one of the paths blocked by the Bandemon and opened my mouth. 
But…
"I—."
"I—."
Why does this old man keep doing this?
It’s so annoying. 
“Kahi’en, are you doing this on purpose?”
"I, I wouldn't do that!"
Kahi’en met my gaze with an indignant look after I glared at him. 
The village chief, unfazed by this absurd farce, calmly tried to calm us down.
"Don't be childish about this. You both pointed to the same place just now, so you must be thinking the same thing. Right?"
"Well… I think so…."
"I agree."
Kahi’en and I spoke simultaneously again.
“Of course—.”
“Of course—.”
No, even our lines are the same now. This is getting really frustrating…
Ah, I don't know.
I decided to ignore it and speak up, and to my dismay, Kahi’en did the same.
"We should go that way."
"We just need to avoid that path, don't we?"
We paused for a moment, our gazes colliding in the air.
“…”
“…”
Ugh, I really don’t get along with this old man.
***
"There's danger that way, so it's wiser to take a different route, don't you think?"
Surprisingly, Kahi’en’s logic began in a similar way to mine, but his conclusion was entirely different. The reason lay in his thinking process itself.
“No. We need to go there first because there’s danger.”
This chapter is about finding the Evil Spirit Karui. 
And in my opinion, Karui is more likely to be in one of the four types of ravines. It’s the usual way treasures are hidden. 
“There’s even a signpost for you. Why would you waste your time going elsewhere?”
"It's too early to assume that’s a waste of time.  Maybe the other three spots need to be searched to find something, like an item or something!"
"What if the challenge becomes more difficult the longer we wait? The wrong choice could lead to irreversible consequences."
"T, that’s going too far!"
"Kahi’en, you need to be prepared for every possibility in a rift.  Especially when it’s your first time entering.  Considering your naive words…."
“…”
"You're still a magician, not an explorer."
“What?! ”
Seeing Kahi’en's red face, I couldn’t help but think back to our debate in the Library Island about which 1st-grade monster to summon. It was exactly like this. 
“We can talk all day, but the Count will be the one making the decision anyway. Count, you decide.”
There was no point in wasting time, so I left the decision to the village chief. 
Of course, the result was already predetermined. 
“Hmm… I think it's best to follow the Baron’s suggestion.”
The village chief pretended to ponder for a moment before siding with me. That ended the discussion on this topic. 
“T, that’s just…!”
Kahi’en seemed displeased with the decision, but he couldn't openly contradict the village chief, who held the ultimate responsibility. 
‘Alright, so the route is decided.’
Kahi’en retreated with a wry smile. 
Our relationship might have become slightly strained, but it didn’t matter. 
In fact, it felt somewhat satisfying. 
I approached the Archbishop, who had been on my mind.
"Archbishop, why have you been keeping to yourself since earlier?"
“Ah… Ah! I was just thinking.  About the Evil Spirit, you see.  Maybe this is how I can meet it here.”
“Why are you hesitant about meeting it?”
"Well… I don't know."
The Archbishop’s expression looked troubled. 
Well, is this some kind of religious dilemma?
As a non-religious person, I can’t understand, but it isn’t something I need to be concerned about.
“I don’t care what you’re worrying about.  Don’t get distracted and end up tripping over your own feet. Got it?”
“…Of course I’ll manage just fine.”
Ugh, he’s so sassy. 
Anyway, after confirming the Archbishop’s mental state, I had a quick session about the Bandemon.
It wasn't me who played the teacher role, but Kahi’en. He might lack the explorer mindset, but he isn’t lacking in knowledge.
‘He’s missing a few details, though.’
Well, it’s fine. If I explained in detail, they might just think I’m weird.
…Plus, I’m too lazy.

「You've defeated the Bandemon. EXP+7」
***
The battle with the third-grade Bandemon wasn’t particularly difficult. After all, we were all wearing OP buffs. 
The Priest's infinite divine power.
The Knight's doubled stats.
The Magician's powerful ancient magic.
Even considering that I couldn't play the tank role as effectively as before, these bonuses made taking down a third-grade monster a piece of cake.
‘Maybe we should have taken it on as a group.’
The Bandemon only dropped one magic stone, but I wasn’t disappointed. 
It’s not like those minor details mattered. 
I was more concerned about something else. 
“That wasn’t even difficult. Such a big old man, scared of everything.”
”…Baron, what did you just say?”
"Nothing?"
“Nothing?! You just said it to me.”
“But you’re not exactly young yourself.”
It might have been a little childish, but I shot back at Kahi’en without missing a beat.
Besides...
‘He’s been getting a little too big for his britches lately.  He might be a nobleman, but he doesn’t even have a title.’
It was time to put him back in his place. 
“Old Man….”
Just as I was about to retort further, Erwin interrupted me.
“…Why?”
“J, just….”
“Just what?  Speak quickly.”
"W, well… you’ve been acting a bit out of character today…."
For some reason, I couldn’t help but chuckle at his cautious words.
"What do you mean by out of character?"
All of them always had such high expectations of me. 
Erwin, Amelia, even Misha…
"Ah, is it because this isn't your usual, more ‘noble’ side?"
I took a step forward, and Erwin took a step back, looking at me with an expression of fear I had never seen before.
“What… is this?”
The moment I saw that expression, I snapped out of it. 
At the same time, I clearly felt the rush of emotions that had been swirling around me, without any hint of dissonance.  It was such a natural transition that I hadn’t noticed it until now…
“Damn it.”
Realizing my current state, I dropped the hammer I was holding. Then...
KWAANG-!
I bent over and slammed my forehead hard against the hammer. 
"Ugh… I can finally think straight now."
Something was wrong with my head the moment we entered the Great Maelstrom. 
Or maybe...
"You’re being barbaric…"
“…”
“Why, why are you looking at me like that?”
Maybe it wasn’t just me who had a problem.
