## The First Clear (5) 
A considerable amount of time passed after the raid on the Hamsik House.  There was nothing particularly worth investigating beyond the stone door, contrary to our expectations.
"These are objects from the first place we discovered, they can't all be ordinary. Commander, please trust us. Through research, we will surely uncover everything that has been hidden," one of the mages who had been tasked with examining the looted objects from the Hamsik House, pleaded.
"I will leave this library tomorrow. Make sure you find the clues before then," the Commander responded, his voice laced with a subtle hint of urgency.
"Yes sir!" 
All the mages in the exploration force, with none of the other specialists or fighters, gathered and examined the loot during the rest of the exploration team.  
‘Even if they find something, I can just ask Raven.’ 
Raven, with her scholar's gaze, could be seen performing various experiments in a makeshift laboratory that the mages had conjured in an instant.  She wore a rather amused expression. 
‘Does she really enjoy this so much…?’ 
As a Barbarian warrior, I couldn't comprehend such a preference, but as a friend, I had to respect it.  Besides, having someone like her around could be helpful.
‘Bersil, being a player, seems to have little interest in scholarship itself.’
Anyway, we had free time until the next day, so I simply rested without any worries. 
How long had it been?
“The squad reassignment is complete.  All members are to check their new unit affiliations on the posted notices!”
The exploration force had undergone a personnel redistribution. After seven people were lost during the library raid and another 27 perished during our recent encounter, the team needed to rebalance its composition.
“There are no changes in our Unit 4.” 
Our unit, with its smaller number from the start, had no changes in personnel, whereas Units 1, 2, and 3 had seen some adjustments.
Unit 1: 49 members.
Unit 2: 49 members.
Unit 3: 48 members.
The initial 60-member units had dwindled considerably. With 37 of us remaining, the gap had narrowed to a mere 10 members.
“A meeting will be held! All unit leaders and commanders are to attend!”
Following the personnel redistribution, another meeting was convened.
Ugh, these guys really hold meetings morning and night.
I arrived at the barracks last, just as the meeting began. 
“Your efforts and loyalty have allowed our expedition force to successfully complete the library raid, Nia Raphdonia.”
"Nia Raphdonia!" 
Jerome, the Commander, for a change, didn’t delegate the meeting to the Vice Commander and instead took charge directly.
"The mages are diligently researching, but no clues regarding escape have been found yet. Therefore, we will discuss this matter again after the research is complete."
“So, today…”
"Today, I have called you all together to discuss future plans."
With that, the topic for today's meeting was announced.
Having cleared the library, where would we head next?
Naturally, all the commanders' gazes turned towards me.  Being the one who had stayed here the longest and provided the map, they clearly considered my opinion crucial.
‘…Where should we go next?’ 
Three potential targets immediately came to mind.
1. Giant Island.
Here, we can farm essence from the Hipramagicent and encounter a boss monster, a colossal Giant. 
Plus, there’s also a portal stone connected to the second floor.
2. Rainbow Island.
The island in the direction of the rainbow we observed at the end of the rainy season.
Everything about this island remains unknown, but my gamer intuition is telling me… 
This island is the key to the first floor.
3. Village Chief’s Island.
No need to elaborate.
As I suspected, this is where the portal stone to the first floor is located.  Even if that’s not the case, the Village Chief is hiding a significant secret.
If we can capture him and find out what it is, it will be incredibly helpful for our journey. 
‘Ugh, what should I do?’ 
While conquering the library, I observed the expedition force’s overall strength.
Honestly, it’s not without flaws, but it’s undeniable that they are a formidable force.  
Also, considering the composition of this group—knights, mages, and priests—they are more specialized in PvP than monster hunting. 
Essentially, I judged that we could raze the Village Chief’s village in a single night. 
‘But for some reason, I feel uneasy…….’ 
I decided to follow my gut feeling once again.
Therefore, I unfurled the map I had obtained earlier from the Hamsik House and pointed to a location.
“…I think our next exploration target should be here.”
It was the one remaining unvisited island, excluding Rainbow Island.
"Let’s first confirm what kind of place this island is. If there is nothing of value, or it seems like it will take a long time to conquer, we can head straight to Rainbow Island." 
Essentially, we’d just survey the map before proceeding to Rainbow Island.
After clearing Rainbow Island, we’d decide the next destination based on what we learn there.
But…
"Understood. I understand the Baron’s opinion." 
Jerome merely nodded, acknowledging my suggestion without offering any concrete response.
"What are you all waiting for? I didn't call you all here just to hear the Baron’s opinion. Feel free to express your thoughts on anything."
Following Jerome’s prompt, the other commanders shared their own thoughts, and Jerome listened intently to each one. 
How long had it been?
Finally, the destination was determined through Jerome’s words.
"Tomorrow morning, we will head towards the island where the Village Chief resides.” 
Even if I was curious why he asked my opinion, I couldn’t solely blame him. After all, he did follow my advice when we came to the library island.
‘Ugh, I guess it had a big impact that we didn’t get anything from the library.’
We came here based on my judgment, but ultimately lost troops and gained nothing.
So Jerome made his own decision, it seemed. 
First, we’d capture the Village Chief and extract information before moving on to the next location more efficiently.
‘Is this how things will end up...?’ 
Apart from the unease, I couldn’t offer any convincing arguments to contradict his decision, so I simply agreed.
Oh, I had a question, of course. 
It was something I had wanted to ask from earlier.
“Tomorrow? It’s still the rainy season. Where are we going?” 
It’s not even like the rainy season is ending soon.
It’s just two days away, the dangerous monsters are still falling.
But Jerome dismissed my concern.
"Didn’t Baron Yandel also move during the rainy season? Why can’t we do the same?”
“Uh… but we were almost at the end of the rainy season then… ”
"A comprehensive investigation of this layer is also one of the expedition force's tasks. Therefore, wouldn’t it be good to experience this rainy season properly, once and for all?"
“…”
As always, these guys were tougher than I imagined.
***
It was the wee hours of the morning, with the mages busy researching and only the night watchmen patrolling, vigilant for any unforeseen circumstances.
I was currently lying in my blanket, staring blankly ahead.
I’d taken a nap after the meeting, but couldn’t fall asleep properly.
“…” 
Even if I tried to force myself to sleep, I didn’t think I’d be able to.  So I just spent the time organizing my thoughts.
The first Rank 1 monster kill.
The dozens of casualties.
The disappearance of Hamsik and the Golden Book.
The next destination determined during the meeting.
So many events had happened today, and with them, many things to consider.
‘Jerome Saintred’s words were meaningful.’
The Commander of the expedition force said today…
No matter how many people die, if we complete the exploration of this place and bring me back alive, the mission will be considered a success.
Thanks to that, the uneasiness I had been experiencing, wondering if something similar to what happened in Ice Rock might happen here, had lessened.
‘If he was planning to kill me, it would have been advantageous for him if more people from Unit 4 died.’
But Jerome’s actions were the complete opposite. 
It was an action he wouldn’t have taken if he was scheming behind the scenes.
That’s why I have more questions.
‘Why is the Royal Family… trying to rescue me?  Wouldn’t it be beneficial to them if I died here, a thorn in their side?’
…I don’t know.
The more I think about it, the more contradictions seem to emerge. 
So I decided to clear my head, getting out of the blanket and changing my location.
“Baron?”
“I can’t sleep, so I’m going to stretch my body a little.”
“Ah, I see.  Understood.”
After explaining the situation to the night watchman, I went for a walk, like a stroll, towards the edge of the vast library.  
Perhaps I might encounter Hamsik by chance.
Around 10 minutes later, I heard a familiar sound from somewhere.
[Beep…!]
“…Hamsik?”
[…Come this way! This way! Come up this way…!]
After looking around to check if anyone was observing me, I climbed the staircase to the second floor bookshelf as quietly as possible.
Hamsik was hiding in an empty space where the books had been removed.
[Why did you come now…!]
“Oh, I waited until nightfall.”
[Are you… are you alright? You looked pretty hurt earlier….]
Oh… I didn’t expect that to be the first thing you’d ask when we met.
“…I’m fully healed, don’t worry.”
[How can I not worry…! Finally, someone worthy has appeared…!]
Hamsik’s words left me with a tilted head, unable to understand.
“Worthy? Are you referring to… the Golden Book?”
Previously, Hamsik had told me…
That he would never give me the Golden Book. It was an item he had to give to someone worthy someday.
[That’s right…! The moment you defeated Kashan, you became worthy!]
…So the conquest was the requirement for qualification after all.
As a player, my expectation had been met, but I had another question.
"Wait a minute, so everyone here has been granted qualification?"
[What? No way!  Only you are worthy!]
"Hmm, really?"
Then what is the condition?
Is it being the top contributor in battle? Then it makes sense that I’m qualified.
Ah, that's not important…
“So? You became qualified, now what happens?”
With anticipation for a reward, I asked Hamsik, who replied firmly. 
[Here, take it!  This book is yours now.]
The Golden Book, where a story with an abrupt ending was written.
I wondered if I would be able to see the subsequent content after becoming qualified, so I quickly opened it.
But…
“It’s the same as when I saw it last.”
[Really?]
“It’s not ‘really’—you should also tell me how to use this book now that I’m qualified. You just give me the book and that’s it?”
[Uh… why?]
"Ugh…"
Looking at his expression, he seemed to have absolutely no knowledge of how to use this book.
It wasn’t a strange situation though.
[Dungeon & Stone] is an inherently unfriendly game.
It doesn’t properly explain how to use things, even if it gives you something, forcing players to experiment and figure out the rules themselves.
‘…If I put this book back on the altar, maybe something will happen.’ 
I had a few ideas on how to use it, but I couldn’t test them right now.  If something appeared, the reward would go straight to the Royal Family.
Ultimately, I had one option left.
“Anyway, I’ll take this, thank you.”
I put the Golden Book that Hamsik had given me inside the subspace.
“Is that it?  Is there nothing else?”
[Huh?]
“Well, you know, blessings or special equipment, there’s usually a lot, right?”
[You already took everything. My fountain pen, the books I cherished…!]
Ah, right.  
“…”
[… ]
An awkward silence fell between Hamsik and me, and I quickly changed the subject.
“Speaking of which, you might not know this, but we are leaving tomorrow morning.”
[Leaving…?]
“We have things we need to do.  I don’t know when it will be, but we will come back again, so don’t be lonely.”
[Who’s lonely? Don’t be ridiculous. I’m actually happy about it.  Humph! Finally, I can get some proper rest at home!]
I gulped at Hamsik’s words.
Judging by those words, he still seems completely unaware of what happened to his home.
“…”
[…Why are you suddenly quiet?]
“Oh, nothing. I’m going now. I’m hungry!”
I quickly made a natural excuse and returned to the camp and lay down.
The next morning.
The entire exploration force was packing up the campsite, preparing to leave the library.
“Baron?”
Sven Parav, the Goblin Paladin, came to me with surprising news first thing in the morning.
"Last night… he showed me the future again."
“What was it?”
“It’s… ”
Parav hesitated for a moment before closing his eyes tightly, describing the scene he had seen in his dream the previous night.
“I saw… you being brutally executed by the exploration force surrounding you.”
The Goddess has given me a death sentence.
