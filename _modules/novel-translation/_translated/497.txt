## The Quest (2)
Some people possess an aura so potent, a presence so commanding, that they can overpower others with merely a glance. Master Tesulun Lengman Kealunarus, the Archmage of the Tower, was one such individual.
"Archmage…!"
Standing at a height slightly above average, his physique was a typical mage's, lean and frail, with age etched deeply into his wrinkled skin. Truthfully, were it not for the imposing staff he held, reaching his shoulder, he could have passed for an ordinary elderly gentleman.
The Archmage descended the stairs, his steps measured and deliberate. No one dared to speak, not even the warriors, until he stood in the lobby. His gaze, however, held a youthful sharpness that belied his years. But that was not the reason for their silence.
The warriors instinctively felt it – the unspoken power dynamic, even though their realms differed. The Archmage, though a mage, stood as the embodiment of dominance, a force to be reckoned with.
"Baron Bjorn Yandell."
The Archmage, having reached the bottom step, finally spoke, his gaze fixed on me for a moment. “Indeed, you are as the Master described. Welcome.”
His greeting was unexpected. For the master of the tower to greet a barbarian, a barbarian who had invaded his very home, with such cordiality? I'd expected accusations, maybe even insults.
He took a large stride, closing the distance between us. The Archmage responded by retreating a similar step. This solidified my suspicions.
"He’s deliberately staying out of my range."
The Archmage was clearly aware of the 'Unaligned Trust,' and avoiding its influence. Yet, I pretended not to notice, and spoke.
"I wouldn't call it a welcome, seeing as I'm in the middle of interrogating traitors."
My words, dripping with hostility, were met with a wry smile from the Archmage.
"Let's put aside our emotions for now, and engage in an open and honest conversation. What say you, Baron?"
His voice was calm, laced with an air of control, as if he held all the cards.
"Open and honest? Please."
This old man… does he even know? 
I knew that acting so casually with a barbarian would only fuel their stubbornness.
"I refuse! As I said, I'm busy interrogating traitors."
"However, Baron, you must know that they will not speak a word with me present."
He wasn’t wrong. The moment the Archmage arrived, a glimmer of hope ignited in the eyes of the three captured mages.
"If all else fails, I'd use force to intimidate them. But, now that he's here, that's out of the question."
"Take your time, Baron. But if you delay any longer, the royal forces will be here soon."
I made my decision.
"Fine. Speak your mind."
"First, will you release the captured individuals?"
"The warriors, yes. But Marco stays."
"Marco? Is that the young man?"
The Archmage glanced at Marco, who was diligently filming the encounter. He flinched, understandably so. It’s not every day you find yourself under the scrutiny of such a powerful figure.
"The royal family has the right to know everything that happened here."
"Hmm, is that so?"
"Are you denying this right?"
"Of course not. As one who lives in this city, I wouldn't dream of obstructing royal affairs. However..."
The Archmage trailed off, his gaze lingering on Marco once more.
And then, it happened.
"Bang!"
"Ugh! Oof!"
The crystal ball shattered, sending Marco sprawling on the ground.
"Oh dear, it seems it malfunctioned."
Ah, here we go.
"It was bought from the Tower. Must be a defective model."
"Even the most meticulously crafted magical devices can malfunction. I apologize on behalf of the Tower. If you mention my name at the point of purchase, you'll receive a few new ones free of charge."
Interesting, this old man.
"Ainar, take Marco and everyone else down to the lower level."
"Are you sure…?"
I nodded slightly and gave her a nod. Ainar led the warriors down to the lower floor. And then…
"Now, you three, off to dreamland."
The three mages, who had been kneeling on the floor, simultaneously collapsed. A basic sleep spell, nothing more.
Just the two of us remained.
"Now, speak your mind. What did you want to say after getting rid of everyone else?"
"I'll be brief, as time is of the essence."
The Archmage took three steps, crossing the boundary of 'Unaligned Trust.' He looked at me and spoke.
"The Tower will forbid all research using the 'Barbarian Heart,' effective immediately. Any future research will be deemed a violation of forbidden magic and will be punished accordingly."
"And?"
"Those who attempted to acquire the Heart from the black market will also face disciplinary action."
"What kind of discipline?"
"They will no longer be recognized as mages affiliated with the Tower."
In simpler terms, they'll be fired.
"Baron, you might find this punishment inadequate, but it's the best we can do considering their offense."
The Archmage sounded persuasive, but honestly, this was enough for me. I’d played the role of the outraged barbarian to inflate their crimes, but there was no chance of them being acknowledged.
"Of course, if they try to acquire a Barbarian Heart through the black market in the future, the gravity of their offense will be entirely different. As it would be a blatant attempt to obtain forbidden goods."
Okay, consequences covered.
"And?"
"We will not pursue the matter of your illegal entry and unauthorized occupation of the Tower today. You merely came to reprimand us, and the Tower has accepted its wrongdoing and taken corrective measures, thus seeking your forgiveness. That is the story that will be disseminated to the public."
I was speechless.
"Are you… serious?"
What the Archmage had just said was tantamount to the Tower admitting defeat to the barbarians.
But…
"I am."
I felt less joy and more unease. There’s no such thing as a free lunch in this world.
"So, what do you want in return?"
I asked directly, in true barbarian fashion. The Archmage named a single person.
"Master Lorendel Gallinbarret of the Triten School."
The mage who’d placed a bounty on my heart in the black market.
"Clear her of all charges."
Ah, so that’s why her name hadn’t been mentioned.
I took a moment to process this information before asking,
"Is she worth that much to you?"
"She is a truly remarkable mage. While she made a foolish, reckless decision due to a moment of greed, her research holds the potential to revolutionize our world. I have no doubt about it."
"No doubt, you say?"
Clearly, there was more to it than that.
"Lorendel Gallinbarret… she might be a bigger catch than I realized."
Anyway, I'll ask Amelia to investigate her later.
"So? What do you say to my offer? I want an answer."
"Fine. I accept your proposal."
I ended the negotiation there. It was a shame to let go of the woman who’d tried to steal my heart, but even with that consideration, I’d gotten more than I’d hoped for. There was no reason to push my luck.
But, was he still anxious about something?
"Well then, Baron, are we now free of animosity towards each other?"
The Archmage was subtly trying to gauge my intentions, using the activation of 'Unaligned Trust' to peek into my true feelings.
"And what about you? Are you free of animosity towards me?"
I evaded his question and fired back. To my surprise, the Archmage readily responded.
"I have no animosity towards you, Baron. I never did. You are the leader of your people, simply doing what you must."
A true businessman, I see.
Regardless, it was difficult to refuse his offer. There was nothing to gain for me by doing so.
"Then I believe it’s time to hear the Baron's true thoughts."
"True thoughts, huh?"
"If you say you have no animosity, you'd be lying. So many have died in the labyrinth because of the Heart. Of course, I hate you. But…!"
I trailed off, turning my wrist subtly to conceal the 'Unaligned Trust' compass.
"Don't worry. As long as you don't mess with us, we won’t attack the Tower!"
It was a trick only possible when I was the one using 'Unaligned Trust.'
"And moreover, you seem like a good guy after all!"
The compass wouldn’t work if I was lying.
***
The events that followed were uneventful. 
The royal forces soon arrived at our floor, taken aback by the standoff between a national baron and the master of the Tower. However, the Archmage stepped forward, taking responsibility and defending me, saying the Tower was at fault.
"So, you’re saying Master Kealunarus apologized, and Baron Yandell accepted?”
"That’s right."
The military commander, a seasoned veteran, was skeptical but didn't probe further. What did it matter to the royal family? As long as the situation was resolved peacefully and a wider conflict was avoided, they’d be happy.
"Get a move on! Finish it up already!"
The military forces dismissed everyone, including the barbarians. The Archmage surrendered the 36 mages who were accused of collaborating with the black market to the royal forces.
"But I don't see the mage who supposedly wanted the Baron's Heart in this group."
While contacting the black market was a misdemeanor, attempting to assassinate a noble was a serious crime punishable by death.
But, it was easy to let her off the hook.
"Ah, that? You know, I can't recall if that was the right name. I might be mistaken, and we can't arrest the wrong person. If I remember correctly later, I'll let you know."
"...Understood."
Master Lorendel Gallinbarret of the Triten School.
The royal investigator seemed to have noticed that she was the key to this entire ordeal, but he didn't say a word. As I said before, they were not interested in such matters.
"I’m relieved this has concluded so peacefully. And, Baron Yandell, you’ve caused a disturbance involving more than a thousand people in the city without the King’s permission. We’ll have to fine you, albeit a symbolic one. Please pay up."
After that, the military forces departed, taking the mages with them. 
So, it was time for me to leave as well.
"I'll ensure they are punished as promised once their guilt is confirmed, so don't worry, Baron."
"Okay, I’ll be off then. I'm starving."
I was about to head home, but Ainar, who had been waiting for me, dragged me to the holy ground.
“Boom! Boom! Boom!"
The holy ground was already in the midst of a victory celebration. The warriors were drinking, dancing, and singing, even though there weren't any formal arrangements. This was the biggest festival I'd ever seen. It felt like every barbarian in the city had gathered here.
"Bjorn!"
"The chieftain."
"Chieftain! Give us a speech! We're all waiting!"
Eventually, Ainar pushed me towards the stage, forcing me to deliver a speech. It was, of course, a brief barbarian-style speech.
"We—!"
"Woohoo!"
"Have won—!!"
"Behel—laaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!"
Even a single, short declaration ignited their already frenzied atmosphere.
"I can't miss this opportunity for publicity."
I commanded Caron to dispatch the 'Comrades' to spread the word about real estate amongst the tribe. And they did an excellent job, promoting it throughout the festival.
"Did everyone hear? This victory is just the beginning!"
"Our tribe will prosper, and property prices will skyrocket!"
"Only a foolish warrior wouldn't buy now!"
"What? You’re saving for a new weapon? What era do you live in? When are you going to buy that new weapon?"
This is the kind of publicity that will fuel the real estate market.
After a bit of revelry, I quietly slipped away and returned home. Amelia was sitting on the sofa in the dark living room.
"Yandell."
"...Yeah?"
"Are you sick or something? You never have a quiet day."
For some reason, Amelia was annoyed. She hadn't even commented on my plan to smash the black market. Why was she so upset?
I thought for a moment and found the answer.
"I'm sorry. I acted without consulting you."
Amelia’s expression softened, perhaps my answer was correct.
"...You know."
"Huh? Did you just smile?"
"What are you talking about?"
"You did smile! I saw it!"
"...Don’t fabricate things."
Fabricate? I saw it clearly.
I chuckled and took a seat on the sofa. Amelia casually spoke.
"So, are you feeling better?"
Oh, she’s really hitting me hard. 
I felt strange but decided to be honest.
"Yeah. Much better."
Amelia nodded.
"Good to hear."
"..."
After a brief silence, we discussed the events of the day. Erwen, who had apparently been woken up by our voices, joined us, rubbing her eyes. We chatted for a while.
The next morning…
"I… I’m here… Bjorn…"
The guest I’d been waiting for finally arrived.
