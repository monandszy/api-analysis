## Level Up (1)
The chief's eyes narrowed, his gaze sharp and menacing. "Where did you hear about soul branding? It's not something young warriors should be privy to."
Of course, the original source of the information was the game. It was unthinkable that I, an old hand, wouldn't know something so basic. However, I met his gaze with unwavering confidence and said, "I read about it in a book."
Having already verified that the information was readily available in the library, I had nothing to fear. "The book mentioned that soul branding was instrumental in the Holy Artifact War, when the elves fought—"
"Hahahahahahaha!"
The chief burst into a loud, boisterous laugh, cutting me off mid-sentence. I was terrified, but the sound of his laughter held a hint of amusement, which emboldened me.
"Read it in a book? How fascinating! First Einar, and now you, two such inquisitive youngsters! "
Fortunately, it seemed the chief saw the young barbarians' thirst for knowledge in a positive light. 
"…If what the book says is true, I'd like to receive the branding."
"Indeed, we have no reason to deny a warrior's request for soul branding! However, young warrior, there's one small matter."
"Matter?"
"It's quite expensive."
Oh, so that's all. I'd been needlessly worried. Was he serious about this? Of course soul branding required expensive materials. For higher-grade brandings, it was often not money but the scarcity of the necessary components that posed the real hurdle.
"Hahaha! It's commendable that you read a book and traveled all this way, but it seems you didn't look into this aspect of it!"
"I have the money. How much is it?"
The chief looked at me, his eyes twinkling with amusement. "The cost for the Immortal Branding is, hmmm, about 800,000 stones!"
I furrowed my brow. Ugh, 150,000 stones more expensive than in the game. Still, I could manage. 
"I'll pay."
"What?"
"Really?"
The chief and Einar both gasped. Before they could press me further, I opened my pouch and produced a 500,000-stone pouch and three 100,000-stone pouches.
Doubt clouded the chief's eyes. "Bjorn, son of Yandell, where did you get so much money?"
I’d been anticipating this question. I'd even come up with a scenario beforehand. I embellished my encounter with Erwen, claiming I had found an elf in the first floor of the dungeon, forced her into servitude, and stumbled upon an essence, for which the elf’s sister had paid me a hefty sum.
"Hahahahahahaha! Good for you, pointy ears!"
"To fleece those pointy-eared scoundrels, you are truly one of a kind! Bjorn, son of Yandell!"
The barbarians seemed to genuinely enjoy the story.  The elder even came over from his spot, joining the chief and Einar, their smiles wide. Were they just that starved for amusement? 
"Hahaha! I can't remember the last time I laughed this much!"
The chief then took 600,000 stones from my hands.  Wait, he said 800,000 stones, didn't he?  As I tilted my head in confusion, he gave me a friendly pat on the shoulder. "This is a gift from me, for the young warrior who shows such great potential!"
My shoulder throbbed as if it had been dislocated, but the reward was sweet. Damn, 200,000 stones just for a few words! Our chief, he's as fiery as any barbarian. I shouted with genuine enthusiasm, "I will continue to humiliate those pointy-eared bastards and become an even greater warrior!"
"We shall see! Young warrior, Bjorn, son of Yandell!"
This must be what they mean when they say a person grows on you. I’m starting to like the barbarians.

Soul branding is a kind of enhancement technique. The principle is to imbue the flesh with ‘soul energy’ contained within magical materials, bestowing special abilities. This is also why all barbarians are tattooed.
It was supposed to be set up so that the soul circuit was visible even when they were adults, which is why they got tattooed as infants when their souls were comparatively pure. 
"Think carefully. If you choose this path, you cannot receive any other soul branding. Are you sure?"
"Of course."
I knew every path. I wouldn’t change my mind.  Not only did the Immortal path's higher-grade branding contain the core of my training method, but even without that, its abilities were top-notch.
"The elder has arrived. You may leave now."
Once Einar left, the chief took me to the shaman’s tent.  Then the procedure began. 
“Hmm, your circuit is exceptionally clean. If you continue to maintain a pure heart, the soul will grant you immense power.”
The blindfolded shaman muttered something incomprehensible and started poking needles into my upper body, following the pattern of my tattoos. Then…
"Khhhrrrgh…"
“Young warrior, feel free to scream. It’s normal for all warriors."
“Aaaaaaaaaaaack!!”
The pain felt like a tenfold increase in potion effects. Damn it, I’d been expecting something like a tattoo. Does this mean I'll have to endure this every time I move to a higher path?
"Alright, that’s it. You look tired, so go out."
When the shaman finally uttered the words I'd been waiting for, the sky was already dark.  The chief, who’d brought me here, was nowhere to be seen.
“Thank you.”
“Kkkkk, this is the first time I’ve heard a warrior thank a shaman."
Huh? Did I do something wrong?  I didn’t know, but I quickly left the tent, desperate to avoid any further trouble.
“Immortal Branding Stage 1 activated. Natural regeneration significantly increased.”
“Body stat increased by +20.”
I was mentally exhausted, but my body felt inexplicably energized. Is this the power of the soul? It was a strange feeling, as if an unknown force was coursing through my body.  I'll have to check on this later.
"Open the gate!"
I left the sanctuary and returned to the inn, where I tested my new ability a few times before collapsing onto the bed and falling asleep. 
***
Another day passed, and morning arrived. I visited the commercial district I had previously explored with Erwen. This was a trip to invest the 900,000 stones I had left after the chief’s generous discount. 
“You’re the one who came here before, yes?  Selling again?”
"No, I'm here to buy."
I needed a new weapon. I’d sold the hammer I’d taken from that man last time, along with the others. It felt great to wield, but the handle was too long for a one-handed weapon, making it awkward.
"I'd like to see some one-handed blunt weapons."
“One-handed blunt…."
After sparring with Einar, I had decided that blunt weapons suited me better than edged weapons. I needed practice to master swordsmanship.  Sure, I could train and eventually learn, but…
It wouldn’t be very efficient to use a weapon that I’d only use in the early game. Besides, after obtaining that ‘essence’, I planned to focus on shields.
“Hmm.”
The merchant gave me a quick scan and presented me with a one-handed blunt weapon. It didn’t look like a one-handed blunt weapon at all.  Even the lightest one felt at least three times heavier than the two-handed hammer that man had been using. 
Is this really a one-handed blunt weapon?
“This is a one-handed blunt weapon favored by the barbarians.”
Ah, they’d probably love it. My shield was also a massive piece of equipment, forged entirely from solid steel. 
But…
"I want something more ordinary."
"Alright."
There was no need for me to buy something so ridiculous.  A weapon like that would probably increase my damage by severalfold, but…
The monsters on the first floor were already mostly one-shot-kills.  And this wasn’t a fight against a giant monster.  There was a high possibility that a weapon like that would just be cumbersome.
“How about these?”
The merchant presented some new weapons.  Sure, they were still far from standard size, but they’d probably suit a barbarian’s body perfectly.
I settled on a mace of reasonably outrageous size. 
“How much is this?”
“250,000 stones.”
250,000?! The six weapons I sold last time were only worth 350,000?
I frowned, prompting the merchant to add, "The manufacturing difficulty isn't that high, but it's made of high-grade steel, so it's expensive."
Ah, I get it now.  I accepted, though not without a little grumbling.
"I'll buy it if you adjust the price to 220,000 stones."
The merchant stared at me with a curious expression.  …How much of a sucker life do those barbarian bastards live?
"Anyway, those weapons don't even sell that well."
"Barbarians do come looking for them often, though."
Well, maybe if it was the first one they showed me.  The barbarians I know wouldn’t go for something this awkward.  Besides, most barbarians prefer axes and other edged weapons over blunt weapons.  
I added these points, and the merchant agreed to my price with a surprising lack of resistance. 
"Fine. I'll sell it for 220,000 stones."
…I should have asked for 200,000.
"Total item level increased by +85."
Anyway, I continued to browse, eventually buying two more pieces of equipment. 
First, it was half-armor.
"Total item level increased by +57."
It was a simple, flat piece of armor made of steel.  It was basically a bulletproof vest.  It cost 360,000 stones, and I got lucky as I found one that fit perfectly.  If I had to have it custom-made, it would’ve probably cost twice as much.
Second, I bought a helmet.
"It will take about three days. Leave your address, and we’ll have someone deliver it."
Helmets needed to fit perfectly, so I had no choice but to order one custom-made.  I opted for a completely basic design, and the merchant agreed to make it for 170,000 stones.
“Total item level increased by +47.”
As a result, I had about 50,000 stones left.
…I guess I won’t be eating meat for a while.
***
My daily routine was set.
Wake up at 7 AM.
Have breakfast with Erwen.
“Wow, there are potatoes in the stew today!”
“Why do you always eat breakfast here?”
“Because it’s delicious and cheap.”
After breakfast, I’d head straight to the library. If I walked slowly, I would arrive just in time for the 8 AM opening.
“Parsitieve.”
The chronically tired librarian got used to me getting magic from her.
“Alright, see you later.”
“.....”
Of course, I’d never actually had a proper conversation with her.
Grrrrrr.
After reading until 4 PM, I’d grab a simple meal at a restaurant I’d never been to before.
Hmm, this place is expensive and not very tasty.  It’s good for eavesdropping though, as it’s always full of adventurers. 
"Is Einar here yet?"
"Not yet!  I'll spar with you until then!"
Around 5 PM, I’d head over to the barbarian dorms. 
Since the seventh day of training, I’d been sparring with other barbarians.  We fought hard, like them, shirts off, throwing punches, choking each other. 
It wasn’t exactly the kind of systematic martial arts I’d envisioned…
But sparring with the barbarians, with their highly developed instincts and intuition, was ultimately very beneficial.  I was a barbarian too, after all.
“Bjorn, son of Yandell, has won!”
“The greatest warrior ever!”
I was even occasionally winning against Einar, even without the help of new gear.  He’s definitely skilled, but his fighting style is predictable.  I’d tried to advise him, but it was so ingrained in him that it was difficult to break the habit.
“I’m tired! I’m going to sleep!”
"Me too!"
"A wise warrior knows when to rest!"
By 9 PM, the intense, real-life sparring sessions would be over.  Then I'd head back to the dorms, my body covered in sweat and dirt.
By the time I got out of the shower, Erwen would be there. 
“Hey!  Hurry up, the food will get cold!”
“Alright, alright.”
It wasn’t every day, but we’d have dinner together five nights a week.  Most of our conversations would be about Erwen’s day and her feelings — silly, everyday stories.
“Doesn’t it bother you to walk here for an hour every day?”
“Not at all. The food here is cheap and delicious!”
Delicious, my foot.  Why she wouldn't stay with her rich sister, I couldn’t understand.
“Thank you for the meal!”
Once we finished, it would be around 11 PM.  Erwen would always go back to her own lodgings around then.
“Good night. Oh, and I won’t be able to come tomorrow.”
“You wouldn’t have been able to see me anyway. We’ll both be busy tomorrow.”
This was my routine. Day after day.
Checking the time, I hurried up to my room and immediately collapsed onto the bed.
A month had already passed. 
And…
[23 : 41]
The dungeon opens in about 24 hours.
