##  To the Future (6)
“You mean I can go back tomorrow? What are you talking about?”
Amelia avoided my gaze.
“I’m not sure, but I’ve had a hunch from the start.”
“From the start…?”
My head went numb.
“Could this be why she seemed awkward every time we talked about how to go back?” 
I realized the discomfort I’d felt during our previous conversations wasn't a figment of my imagination. However, I still couldn’t grasp the reason behind it.
“If you had a hunch from the start, why didn’t you tell me before?”
Amelia glanced at me once more before averting her gaze. I had no choice but to ask directly.
“Are you… maybe not wanting to go back?”
“That’s…,” she hesitated, shaking her head. “That’s absolutely not true. It’s just… I thought it wouldn’t be bad to stay here a little longer.”
“What? Why?”
My head tilted in confusion, but upon considering Amelia’s perspective, I understood.
“It’s just…,” she mumbled.
“Ah, I see. I get it.”
“You get it…?”
“You were worried about leaving your sister behind,” I said. “If we leave, Laura will be alone for the next twenty years. You probably wanted to help her live a better life. You likely wanted to make sure she would have a good life before leaving.”
“I should have just told you,” Amelia said, her voice tinged with regret. “I didn’t think you wouldn’t trust me that much.”
“We’re comrades, Amelia. Just tell me things like that.”
“Yes… I’ll be sure to tell you from now on.”
“Good.”
Having cleared the misunderstanding between us, I moved on to the next matter. Perhaps the most crucial aspect of our current conversation.
“So, what was your hunch? What made you so confident that we could go back tomorrow?”
“Oh, right. That,” she said, snapping out of her daze. “It’s about that.”
Amelia then explained her method, and I listened attentively, occasionally asking questions.
“Hmm, it certainly seems plausible.” 
To be honest, I had a gut feeling about it the moment she started speaking.  Yes, this was it. Our final task. 
***
The next morning, we checked out early and headed to a nearby restaurant. Amelia had a place she wanted to try.  While I was eager to finish everything and go back, I couldn’t resist her pleading.
“It’s a restaurant that will be gone in twenty years. I mean… if you’re too tired, we can go straight back. I just…,” she trailed off, unable to meet my gaze.
How could I refuse?
“She’s been working so hard that she probably hasn’t had time to go out.  I’ll bet she’s been eating the same thing every day,” I thought. 
Even while asking, Amelia seemed embarrassed.  It seemed like she was ashamed of expressing such a simple desire.  A positive change, worthy of support. 
“It means we've formed a strong bond, that she feels comfortable enough to ask for these things,” I realized.
“If there’s anything else you want to do, just tell me.”
“Well… would it be alright if we went to the Arandeje Art Museum in District 9?”
“The Art Museum?”
“There’s a painting I’ve always wanted to see. I… really wanted to see it, but then it was sold to some wealthy noble.  I won’t get another chance to see it.”
After our meal, we went to the museum. Amelia stood before the painting for over thirty minutes, silent, gazing intently.
“…Is it alright if I look at other things too?” she asked.
“Of course.”
We spent the rest of the day exploring the museum, admiring paintings and sculptures.  To be honest, I was surprised.
“I never knew she was interested in art,” I thought.  I could tell just by looking at her eyes that she was genuinely enjoying herself.
“Amelia, it's great to look at these, but we should get something to eat,” I said.  It was already noon, and we had been walking for hours.  
We found a restaurant nearby and had a quick lunch. 
“Jandel, would it be alright if we stopped by just one more place?”
As if compelled by a hidden desire, Amelia asked, and we boarded another carriage.  We arrived at the Leastrass Orphanage.  The very same place where Dwaki had spent his childhood.  
“This place holds a lot of memories for me.”
We didn’t go inside but instead sat on a bench across the street and watched Laura through the window.  Recovering from her illness, she sat at her desk, working on paperwork.  
She’d gotten a job at the orphanage, thanks to a kind priest.
“I thought she was just helping with odds and ends, but seeing her handle all this paperwork, she’s probably already learned to read,” I said.  “Maybe her memories haven’t been completely erased.” 
I asked Amelia, but she just chuckled wryly and shook her head.
“No, that’s not it.”
“Why are you so sure?”
“She… couldn’t read.”
“…What?”
So she’d become proficient in administrative work in just a few weeks of instruction from the priest?  It was mind-boggling, but not impossible.
“…She’s a prodigy.”
“I had no idea she was this capable. I knew her memory was exceptional, but…”
“What about the priest? Didn’t she think it was strange that Laura learned so quickly?” 
“That woman simply believes that Laura’s memories are returning,” Amelia said.  “Laura seems to believe the same.”
Perhaps the sisters’ true talents weren't in killing people.  Perhaps they were simply shaped by their environment. If they had been born into a normal family, how would Amelia have grown up?  She seems to like art, maybe she would have become a famous painter—
“What’s with that look?” Amelia asked, noticing my gaze.
“Nothing, really. But how long are we going to stay here? It looks like your sister is about to leave work.”
“I guess… we should go.”
We left as Laura finished her paperwork and donned her coat. Then, we headed for the locked sewer grate.
“We’re going back through the sewers again. Don’t you think something is going to happen?” I asked.
“We should be fine. There’s another hidden way into Noark, even if we don’t use the graveyard.”
In the past, we’d needed a Noark identity and had to go through a broker for entry.  However, now we didn’t have that requirement, and Amelia knew of a back way into the city.  A passageway that connected to the Duke’s mansion.
“What’s going to happen to Noark in the future?”  We talked about Noark as we walked.  We had been involved in such a significant event involving the royal family, the Duke of Orculis, and our own group, that we were curious about the future.
“The Duke of Chate will likely be busy cleaning up the mess.”
“Cleaning up?”
I knew the outcome, but I wanted to know the details.
“How can he clean up a mess after getting ambushed by the royal family and losing the battle?”
“Well, Orculis also needs this city,” Amelia said.  “They wouldn’t just let it go.”
I thought about that.  If they wanted the city, they could just take it.  But there was more to the story than that.
“For the portal connecting Noark to the Labyrinth to open, they need the blood of the Duke’s family.”
So, once Duke Chate realized his father had been murdered, he killed off all the other bloodlines in his family. He feared that they might use a weak sibling as a puppet to rule the city.
“What a cunning bastard. He made that decision on the spot,” I thought.
The Duke of Chate managed to negotiate a truce with Orculis by giving them a part of the city, and he gradually stabilized the city’s state.  That was the story of the next twenty years.
“We’re here,” Amelia said.
We left the Duke’s mansion, dodging the guards, and walked through the streets, still smelling of smoke.  We arrived at a modest house.
“Jandel, would you wait here for a moment? I’m going to take a look inside.”
“Sure.”
It was Amelia’s childhood home. 
***
I didn’t need to knock.  Amelia wouldn’t lock her door in those days.  It was a time when she’d just given up.
The door creaked open, and Amelia stepped inside.  She looked around.  The house had only the most basic furniture, but it felt familiar to her.  
The alchemist had given her this house, and it had always stayed like this. Until she left for good when she became an adult.
“…,” she muttered.
A young girl huddled against the wall, startled by Amelia’s presence.  Her eyes, void of color, flickered with a sudden spark.
“Amelia…?”
Amelia lacked telepathy, but as this girl was her past self, she could sense the girl’s thoughts.
“I, I…,” the girl said, a flicker of hope lighting up her eyes.  “Is… Is she…?” 
She hoped.  Hoped that her sister might still be alive.
“Your sister is dead,” Amelia said, her voice firm.
“Ah…” The girl nodded, her eyes returning to their dull state. 
Amelia gently nudged the girl up, forcing her to stand.
“You’ll soon be entering the Labyrinth again.  You’ll be living in the gutter just like before, meeting and killing people.”
“…So?”
The girl’s defiance was a welcome change.  Her empty doll-like form was now showing signs of life. Amelia outstretched her hand.
“Make a promise to me, don’t kill the Barbarian.”
“…Why should I?”
Amelia answered without hesitation.
“You’ll come to realize later that keeping this promise was the biggest blessing in your life.”
The girl clenched her jaw.  She had no outward expression, but Amelia knew her thoughts.
“I don’t know why you’re saying this, but you don’t seem to be lying.”  The girl thought.  “No, you seem to be giving me genuine advice, like my sister would have…”
With a firm grip, Amelia clasped the girl's hand, her fingers intertwining.  She held the girl’s hand tightly, then opened and closed it three times.  It was the action they always used when making a promise to each other.
“How… How did you…?” 
Amelia ignored the girl’s question.  She turned and walked toward the door.
“You’ll come to realize later that keeping this promise was the biggest blessing in your life,” she repeated, her voice echoing in the silence.
Amelia stood at the doorway.  The girl’s voice, weary and strained, filled the air.
“What if…,” she began.
“What if… I don’t kill the Barbarian, but something happens to me?  Do I still have to keep my promise?”
It was a question worthy of her younger self.  She would never make a promise she couldn’t keep, especially because her sister had repeatedly emphasized the importance of promises.
But Amelia responded confidently.
“You can do whatever you want then,” she said.  “It’s not going to happen anyway.”
Amelia opened the door and stepped outside.
“Oh, one more thing,” she called back to the girl.
The girl looked up, her eyes filled with curiosity.
“Lock the door before you leave,” Amelia said before closing the door.
She turned, and her eyes met the Barbarian’s who was waiting for her in the alleyway.
“Did you finish talking?” 
“Yes.”
The promise will be kept.  Even if the girl doesn’t understand our intentions, and even if we couldn’t save her sister.  She received our help.  And her sister taught her to always repay kindness.
“Amelia, there’s a blonde kid staring at me from a distance. We should probably deal with him,” the Barbarian said.
Amelia followed his gaze and saw the familiar face of a boy.
“Oh, he’s Guardweaver Drowes, right?” she said.  “I guess that’s him.  He has another name, though.”
Even as she spoke, a sense of unfamiliarity lingered in her mind.  That boy would later reveal the existence of the Shard of Record, a valuable treasure.  He would betray her and flee, becoming her enemy. 
The scar on her ear was a result of that encounter.  Their pact, forbidding them to kill within the Duke’s mansion and Noark, came into being as a consequence of that betrayal.  It only lasted for a specific period, though, so it wouldn't be applicable in this era. 
None of that mattered, however.
“He looks so familiar.  Am I angry at seeing him?” I thought.  The sight of him doesn’t ignite any rage in me.  It’s as if anger and hatred have vanished from my heart.  
“Maybe we should do something about him,” the Barbarian said, voicing his concern.
Amelia understood the source of her calm. It was a necessary stage in her journey.  Even the pain of her entanglement with that boy was just a part of the process. It was all part of a path leading to this moment, to meeting this man.
“No, it’s fine. Just leave him be,” she said.
“Leave him be?”
It had all been a journey, a sequence of events.  Even the pain she’d endured in her interactions with that boy had been a part of it.  It was all leading up to this moment, to meeting this man.  
“What are you laughing at, all of a sudden?”
“I’m not laughing.”
“You are!”
“…,” Amelia said, choosing to ignore the Barbarian’s persistence.  She began walking again.  The Barbarian quickly followed.
“Hey, why isn’t this working?” he asked, referring to the Shard.
“I don’t know. It’ll work soon.”
“What if it doesn’t?” 
“Then we'll just live here together.  I don’t mind.”
“Um… well, I don’t mean that I don’t like you… or anything,” the Barbarian said, stumbling over his words. 
Amelia couldn’t help but smile, a genuine smile this time.  Not the awkward smile she’d used in front of the mirror.  
She stopped and turned, bumping into the Barbarian, their bodies merging.  
And at that moment.
Flash!
The world was engulfed in white light.
