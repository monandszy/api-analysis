## The Third Record (5)
As I hugged Erwin tightly, bracing myself for the fall, the ground beneath our feet crumbled. A surge of weightlessness coursed through my body, a sensation vastly different from the plummeting I had expected.
A powerful force, defying gravity, lifted us all from the collapsing terrain. It was a levitation spell.
"Is everyone alright?"
Swiftly scanning my surroundings, I saw Gahyeon and the village chief, also suspended in mid-air. For once, I genuinely praised them.
"We're alive thanks to you. Well done."
My mind was racing so fast I couldn't even give proper orders, but they had managed to react accordingly.
"It's not something to be commended for," Gahyeon said.
The old man, so easily embarrassed.  Perhaps he was feeling awkward after our recent scuffle? Whatever the reason, I had to prioritize the essential check-up.
"How long will the spell last?"
"Until we reach the ground. It will be more than enough."
Good. That's what I wanted to hear.
"Excellent. Now, slowly... no, let's just descend quickly, but make sure we don't take any major injuries."
The levitation state left us vulnerable to unforeseen dangers, leaving no room for proper resistance. This decision was based on that.
Following my instructions, Gahyeon finally regained his composure and began the descent.
KWAANG! KWAAK! KUREUREUREUREU... 
The scene around us was, quite literally, hell. Everything was collapsing and disintegrating, giant rocks threateningly whizzing past us.
And… 
"This is truly an adventurous feeling," the village chief said, his eyes wide with curiosity as he looked around, even while plummeting downwards. 
I'd never seen him look so alive. I wasn't sure what was going on in his head, but I didn't have time to analyze his eccentricity.
"What was that back there?"
The floor lord had plunged downwards, hugging the archangel who was on the verge of a massive explosion.  This foe, who we thought was our enemy, had somehow acted as our savior...
"Erwin, did you control him?  Did you make him grab the archangel and dive?"
I wanted to confirm the first possibility that came to mind, but alas, the answer was no.
"No. I tried, but it didn't work."
Huh. So, the floor lord had acted out of his own will?
"Perhaps that monster wasn't our enemy after all," the village chief said, as if he could hear our conversation.
Not entirely wrong, I guess. 
The moment I saw the floor lord, I assumed he was the boss monster.  But…
"Maybe he was actually helping us," I mused.
The Hamsik we met in Chapter 2 gave me a similar feeling.  It also gave us a hint that the higher-ranking beings might be friendly towards Erwin.
KWAANG-! KUUNG-!
As we descended with these thoughts, a massive rock crashed onto Gahyeon's head.
The situation was terrifying, but Gahyeon's protective barrier had shielded him, leaving him unharmed.
The problem was...
"Ah..."
A sound that carried an ominous foreboding. My unease proved well-founded.
"What's wrong?"
"Th-the spell calculations for the levitation magic... they're breaking."
"The calculations are breaking? Explain it in plain language—"
Before I could finish my request...
"Ah..."
Our descent stopped. We levitated briefly before...
"KYAAK!"
We plunged downwards.
***
My head pounded. My lungs felt constricted as if pierced by something, and my spine was screaming in pain.  But…
"We're alive."
What about the others?
The last thing I remembered was falling, seeing the ground beneath us, hugging Erwin, and taking the impact on my back.
"...Ah, Ah...Sir!  Sir! My...  L-L-Lise...?"
Erwin's panicked voice crackled like a broken radio amidst the ringing in my ears.  I also heard the village chief's voice.
"Don't...  move...  wait...  The potions should kick in... soon."
"...Sir!  Sir!"
"He can't hear anything…"
Gradually, the voices became clearer, and I slowly opened my eyelids.
"Sir...!"
"I'm... alright, so... stop."
"Ah, Ah! I'm sorry!"
Finally, Erwin climbed off of me, making it easier to breathe.
"Just hold on a little longer. The way you're recovering, you should be able to move soon."
"How long… was I out?"
"About five minutes."
"Gahyeon...?"
The village chief pointed to a spot as I tried to assess the situation. I struggled to turn my stiff neck, and saw Gahyeon lying there, his leg shattered.
"He's not dead. He must've used some magic to slow our descent. He's taken the potions, but... I'm not sure when he'll wake up."
Right.  Of course.
"And you?"
"I'm fine. I managed to keep my wits about me and cushion the impact properly."
Lucky. 
If only my defense stats were intact, I wouldn't be this messed up.
“…The enemy?”
"Don't worry, everyone's clear.  Focus on recovering."
"Understood.  But your tone…"
"I'm older and have higher rank.  We went through hell together, so I can relax a bit."
Fair enough. 
No one would suspect anything even if I suddenly changed my tone.
"I'll... rest a bit longer."
After that, I closed my eyes and stayed lying down. Soon, my body recovered enough for me to move on my own.
"Do you want some water?"
"Ah, thanks."
The village chief asked as soon as I sat up after drinking water.
"What should we do now?"
From Team Half-Baked to Clan Anabada, it was a question I always heard whenever something went wrong.  People always expected an answer from me. It used to be frustrating, but now I just see it as my fate. It's not like I want to blindly follow someone else's orders either.
"Should we wait until Lord Besil wakes up?"
I have no clue what the best course of action is.  This is our first foray into this rift, after all. From the unusual progression to the existence of Archangel Carui's priest... honestly, my head is pounding.
But…
"No. Let's get Gahyeon and start a perimeter search."
We'll start with what we can do. If we linger, things might get worse.
"Erwin and Gahyeon are with me.  Count, you take the lead."
It was the most dangerous task, but the village chief readily followed my order.  He wasn't just going along with it; he knew he was the best person for the job.
"Keep your promise."
I had promised to bring the Heart of Carui back to the city in exchange for his full cooperation in this rift.
"Don't worry.  I have no intention of breaking my word."
"Good. And if things go wrong, check the notebook."
"Notebook?"
"I put it in your backpack when I gave it to you. It has everything you need to know, so it'll be helpful for your journey ahead."
I didn't realize there was a notebook. I received the backpack right before entering the rift, and I left it outside due to the village chief's warning.
"I'll check the notebook as soon as we get out."
We traversed through the fallen debris for quite some time.
"..."
"..."
Then, all sound vanished, replaced by a chilling silence.  By now, everyone knew the reason.
「The character has entered the range of [Silence].」
「All Soulstone skills are sealed.」
There's a floor lord nearby. 
Should we try to avoid them?  There's no right answer.  I sent a signal to the village chief who seemed to be awaiting instructions.
'Continue.'
We know absolutely nothing about this chapter. We have to get information firsthand, and…
'We can't discount the possibility of them being an ally.'
Even if they were hostile, they had dived down with the archangel on the verge of an explosion.  That was enough of a reason for me to keep going.
"..."
We continued in the same direction, refusing to deviate, and finally found Silent Lord Siliat. 
"..."
"..."
Half-buried in the rocks, the lord was silent and still, surrounded by a suffocating stillness.  They weren't in good shape.  Two of their three exposed arms were broken, bones visible.  The creature lay helpless, half-buried in the rubble, only blinking their eyelids weakly.
"..."
I felt a sense of relief that they weren't a threat, but a shiver ran down my spine.  I knew their strength, but to be reduced to this state by a single blast...
If we had been directly caught in that explosion, what would've happened to us?
'I don't... see the archangel.'
Scanning my surroundings, I had Erwin climb off me and slowly approached the creature.
Silent Lord Siliat.  They didn't even flinch as I approached.  Only their weary eyes met mine.
"..."
I reached out, cautiously touching their face.  Even with contact, they remained silent, as if they had no reason to be hostile towards us.
'Why did you help us?'
I wanted to ask, but my voice wouldn't come out.  Even if it did, I doubt they'd give me a proper answer.  So, I decided to answer for them.
"Maybe you have a story, too."
I now knew something about this labyrinth. Rift guardians and floor lords were real people, each with their own stories.  Or maybe, it wasn't just them.  Perhaps every creature within this labyrinth was the same.
In a way, they were more pitiful than me, who was dragged here and forced to fight for my life in this strange world.
Swoosh.
I withdrew my hand and stepped back. The village chief sent a sign with a glance.
'Kill it.'
A simple gesture, but one that clearly conveyed his intention.  I silently shook my head, gesturing for us to retreat.
"..."
The village chief seemed puzzled, but he followed my instructions, presumably due to our agreement. 
The moment we left their domain...
"Why didn't you kill it?" he asked.
"It looked too weak to pose a real threat."
I'm not sure.  Why did I choose to spare them?
"Still, it did help us.  I thought killing them might backfire somehow. We can kill it... after we gather more information."
It wasn't a complete lie.
But...
"Hmm, I suppose that makes sense."
Unlike the village chief, who readily accepted my reasoning, I was confused. I knew there were other reasons.
The floor lord's Soulstone. 
Their Floor Loot.
The Floorstone used to open rifts.
I'm not sure, but maybe killing them would've allowed us to easily obtain those rewards.
But I didn't.
'Compassion… definitely not that.'
I can't explain it.  I can only say it was an impulsive decision.
[Come closer...]
A nameless voice interrupted my thoughts. It came from a completely different direction than where the floor lord was.  I now knew for sure.
"It wasn't them…"
The creature that used those provocative lines to call out to us, tempting us into their trap, wasn't the floor lord.  Honestly, it did feel strange, considering they didn't even have lines in the game.
"Then, we should head towards the sound?"
I nodded. The village chief took the lead, and as Erwin and I followed at a distance, we soon found the source of the voice.
[Right...]
[Come closer... I'll hold you tight.]
It wasn't what we expected at all.
"A Soul Eater...?"
A 5-star rare species.  It only spawns in the Great Magma at the opening of the labyrinth and grants a random amount of EXP between 100 and 200 upon defeat.
[I'll grant your wishes...]
What the heck?  Shouldn't there be a boss monster or something?
「Soul Eater has summoned [Soul Knight].」
The skills they used seem to be pretty much the same.
[KYAAKK—!!]
The Soul Eater was cut in half by the village chief's casual slash and instantly defeated.
「Soul Eater defeated.」
This part was shocking, but not a problem.  
It's like a McGuffin in a novel.  It seems important, but it's actually just a meaningless common mob.
It could be interpreted that way, but...
'What the heck is this?'
The next scene made my head spin.
「Guardian defeat bonus. EXP +3」
Not only did a rainbow Soulstone representing a guardian appear in the air where the Soul Eater had been, but...
WHOOOOSH!
A portal representing the rift's completion appeared.  Red and blue.  And two of them.
