## Chapter 637: Political Marriage (1)
"Marry and produce an heir."
Upon hearing this condition, I momentarily lost my composure. But when I considered it further, it was a perfectly reasonable demand from the Patriarch's perspective.
"What Baron Yandel has achieved in these few years is something even the greatest heroes cannot surpass. I, or anyone else, cannot deny that. However," the Patriarch paused, flicking his fingers, "it's a matter of time before it all disappears."
Baron Yandel's family still lacked an heir. In simpler terms, the moment I died, our Baronate would plummet into the abyss of obscurity. It wasn't a false statement, even to my ears. I had no children, not even close relatives.
"Should the Baron perish now, the Yandel Baronate would vanish that very day. Most of the Baron's possessions would be reclaimed by the royal treasury."
As the Patriarch, who was planning to actively support me, this was undoubtedly a cause for serious concern. Risk management, at the very least? My demise would disrupt all his plans, but if the Baronate remained, then, from Melbes' perspective, which valued the number of affiliated families, it would at least minimize the losses.
"What if I say I don't have any immediate plans to marry?"
"Then, unfortunately, this proposal must be put on hold. If even such basic conditions cannot be met, even I, with my influence, cannot convince the other families."
My tentative probe was met with a more resolute response than anticipated. There was no sense of negotiation or compromise.
"Nevertheless, our Welbeit Earldom will support the Baron.  However, as I mentioned earlier, securing the full support of Melbes will take a considerable amount of time."
"I see."
I simply nodded, needing time to consider the situation. The Patriarch added soothing words.
"Furthermore, the heir does not have to be a Barbarian. While Melbes prefers a non-human race due to its nature, I have no intention of forcing that upon you. The priority is to prevent the Baronate from falling into the hands of the royal family."
In essence, my future spouse didn't have to be a Barbarian.
"Of course, taking a woman from your own race as your partner is the most ideal choice. If the first child inherits your bloodline properly, there will be fewer succession disputes when you have multiple heirs."
Having lived amongst the aristocracy until his hair turned silver, I wasn't surprised by these words.  Rather than thinking he was being nosy, I found myself thinking, "This man is truly rational."
But...
"I'll handle that matter myself."
"Should I take this as your acceptance of the proposal?"
"I said I would consider it."
A typical Barbarian's evasive tactics, always leaving room for escape.
"I see."
The Patriarch seemed satisfied with my response, and with a smile, continued.
"If you lack a suitable partner, we could consider our granddaughter—."
This old man, where does he come up with this?
"No."
"If you dislike beastfolk, I can also help you find a suitable daughter from another family..."
"I said no, didn't I?"
I sighed, exasperated, and the Patriarch's eyes took on a meaningful glint. It wasn't disappointment at my unexpected response.
"You have a partner, don't you? Someone you have already considered in your mind when you heard the proposal."
The Patriarch nodded, a kind smile spreading across his face.
"That's enough for today."
...As expected, age and experience are truly formidable. 
***
After the marriage discussion concluded, the door opened and a servant entered, carrying a tea tray. As if waiting for the conclusion of this topic, we sipped our tea and shifted our conversation to a new subject.
"Baron, have you checked the status of the Yandel Baronate that was under construction in District 7?"
"I have."
Even now, the scene remains horrific in my mind.  It was evident the construction was nearing completion, with the roof flawlessly installed.  If only it hadn't been shattered.
'So, my move-in date has been pushed back again...,' I thought. 
When will the construction of my Yandel Baronate finally be complete? The prospect seems daunting, but I decided to think positively. If it had been completed according to the initial plans, the space would have been extremely cramped in its current state.
"It's best to buy more land nearby, now that you have a larger family, unintentionally."
"I suppose we must. But didn't you already promise to buy me land knowing I needed more space?"
"Haha, it's not easy to read Baron Yandel's mind. I wanted to hear it from you directly."
"Just ask me straightforwardly next time. It'll be easier for both of us."
"Oh, if that's the case, then how much land do you desire? Considering the current situation, we should be able to purchase it at a very reasonable price."
We spent the rest of the time discussing and adjusting minor details, casually conversing as if we were simply chatting. And then...
"Let me know as soon as you have a decision. There are many things to prepare for a grand wedding."
After concluding my meeting with the Patriarch, I boarded a carriage and returned to the village. As we rode, I stared blankly out the window.
"Marriage...," I murmured.
It was a topic I had never contemplated before. Or rather, I had thought about it a few times, but always dismissed the idea as being beyond my reach.  There was only one occasion when I had truly considered it...
But that ended badly.
"Sigh...," I sighed, my mind racing.
My chest wasn't tight, but somehow, I couldn't stop sighing. It felt like I was facing a mountain I would have to climb someday.
Marriage, marriage, marriage.
The two-syllable word that the Patriarch had left me with at such a random time kept echoing in my mind.
Clunk.
Even in the swaying carriage.
"It's the Chieftain! The Chieftain has returned!"
Even in the village, where I was greeted with cheers from the warriors.
".....And the Bifron residents are settling in well, with no major issues so far. However, it seems a waste to have so much manpower sitting idle, so I'm thinking of deploying them to various tasks within the village starting tomorrow. What do you think?"
Even while listening to the Administrative Chief's work report in his office.
And...
"Hehe, sir. Have some of this too."
"Thank you."
"What do you think? I added a little more lemon juice than usual today. Does it taste alright?"
"It's delicious."
"You don't look too happy. Was something unpleasant happening there?"
"No."
Even during a meal with my colleagues.
The two words kept getting stuck in my throat like a thorn, preventing me from fully focusing on the conversations.
"Marriage...," I muttered.
What should I do about this?
Should I do it, or should I not?
I had no intention of getting into a political marriage, but that thought kept nagging at me.
"!!!"
"??!!"
"???!!"
If I never planned to return to Earth...
And if I planned to continue living in this world...
Would I eventually have to marry someone?
'Then, I can have children, grandchildren, and live a peaceful life—.'
Well, even that…
"It wouldn't be so bad, would it?"
It was at that moment when I inadvertently uttered those words aloud.
Suddenly, I snapped out of my thoughts, and a strange silence descended upon the room.
"..."
"..."
Not everyone was looking at me. Some were frozen, holding their spoons, while others dropped theirs.
"Hicc!"
One of them even choked on their food and let out a hiccup.
".....Oh?"
Someone, who had been diligently chewing their food, swallowed it and muttered an unintelligible exclamation.
And from that point, ...
"Bjorn Yandel."
"Yeah?"
"What did you say just now?"
As if someone pressed the play button, the momentarily paused time resumed its flow.
"Mar, mar, marriage! You, you said, you said marriage?!”
The gazes that had now converged on me were filled with curiosity.
"I, I also said it wouldn't be bad."
Realizing that I had just uttered a soliloquy, I was speechless, unable to respond. That's when Auyen, who was sitting beside me, cautiously spoke up.
"Indeed, it is time for you to find a partner. In fact, everyone in the city wonders why you haven't done it already. However,"
"However?"
"To suddenly bring up such a topic... Could it be that you have someone in mind to be your wife?"
Everyone at the table gulped at her direct question, which sounded like a statement of responsibility.
I understand their reaction.
Regardless of how things might unfold in the future, we were bound by a common fate.
Yes, so...
'I might as well be honest.'
I placed the spoon I was holding on the table.
Taking a deep breath, I recounted the proposal I had received in Melbes.
It wasn't a long story.
Marry and produce an heir.
Then Melbes will lend its full support to the Yandel Baronate.
The spouse doesn't have to be a Barbarian.
It was a proposal that could be summarized in just a few lines.
However, describing my colleagues' reactions would take dozens of lines, if not more.
"Ah... s, so that's, that's what it was?"
"It's just an old man's foolish rambling."
"So, so what? What are you going to do, sir? If you need a partner, then..."
"Ooh! Bjorn's son! He'll surely possess extraordinary qualities! I'll raise him to be a formidable warrior!"
"Ainar, what do you mean?"
"Yes. I can't just let it slide. Ainar says she'll raise your son."
"Huh? What's the problem? Bjorn's son is practically my own child."
"No, I mean..."
"C, cut it out! It seems she didn't mean it that way."
"Sigh...,"
A situation too chaotic for words.
However, it was resolved in the most unexpected way. 
Well, to be precise, it wasn't resolved but rather entered a temporary lull.
"So... did you accept the proposal...?"
Amelia's direct question silenced the room.
"..."
"..."
"..."
Even a seasoned recreational instructor, accustomed to public speaking, would find it difficult to speak up in such an intense atmosphere.
I gave a bitter smile and, as always, answered honestly.
"I've decided to think about it."
"...T, th, think about it?"
"Yes, think about it."
"But why? Why are you only thinking about it?"
It was a bizarre question, even upon reflection.
After all, Barbarians aren't hermaphrodites.
"Well..."
"...Well?"
"You'd need the other party's consent, wouldn't you?"
My half-hearted, spontaneous statement once again plunged the table into an awkward silence.
One, two, three seconds.
How much longer would the silence last?
"Th, then that means you're considering getting their consent in the future..."
"Y, yes."
"Th, this might be my misunderstanding, but, what you said earlier... It sounded like you already had someone in mind."
Auyen's question prompted me to rise from my seat.
After all, my life as a warrior had taught me one thing:
A clever warrior chooses their own battlefield.
Therefore...
"My stomach is full, and I'm feeling sleepy."
"...Yes?"
"I'm going to bed."
I quickly rushed to my room, escaping in a typical Barbarian manner.
I immediately locked the door, laid down on the bed, and wrapped myself in blankets. It brought a little peace of mind. 
It was embarrassing to show my colleagues that I was running away, but I couldn't help it.
A warrior is someone who overcomes any obstacle.
Even if Barbarians value honesty as a virtue.
As a K-Barbarian with Confucianism ingrained in their soul, how could I speak?
"You have a partner, don't you? Someone you have already considered in your mind when you heard the proposal."
Oh, I can't tell anyone this.
'Come on, Hansoo...,' I thought.
I have to admit, more than one person came to mind.
