## The Shifting Fate (2)
A dusty clearing, with ash-grey clouds looming overhead. This place was where the barbarians usually gathered, holding council or announcing important news.
Other races, obsessed with decorum and security, usually built such spaces indoors. However, barbarians found this inefficient. Why congregate indoors to discuss matters when you could simply stand on your sturdy legs and listen, without the need for chairs? 
Therefore, the Barbarian sacred grounds had no dedicated meeting room. When Bersil requested space for a gathering of several dozen, the administrative secretary directed her to this clearing.  Naturally, she couldn't comprehend how a group of this size could possibly lack such a basic facility.
"[Don't try to understand everything. Just accepting it as it is is much better for your mental health.]"
Hearing the secretary’s words, uttered with a detached air, Bersil nodded involuntarily.  The advice felt genuinely sincere, and when she thought about it, it wasn't entirely wrong.  A large meeting room would actually hinder communication when a large group was trying to converse.
'Bringing everyone together like this naturally creates a more horizontal atmosphere,' she reflected. 'Perhaps this is the very strength of the Barbarians.' 
It was surprising how easily benefits became apparent after understanding the rationale behind them.  It seemed, however, that the leaders of the various clans summoned to the clearing hadn't reached that stage yet.
“Ahem.”
“What is the reason for calling us to this clearing so early in the morning?”
“How can we discuss important matters here? Don’t the Barbarians have any sort of meeting hall?”
“No, we don’t.”
“Haha… for all their progress, they still… ”
“Stop it.” 
To Bersil, these individuals seemed entirely unaware of their current circumstances. After all, they weren't guests. 
‘I need to address this first,’ she thought.
Before the official meeting began, she addressed this point directly.
“You all seem unaware of the situation. We are refugees, fleeing a war. The Barbarians have graciously given us shelter.”
“Ahem.”
“As such, wouldn’t it be fitting to take a moment to express our gratitude for the safe haven and provisions they have provided?”
“... ”
“You never know, right? What if they decide to banish us? Then we’ll be forced to return to that dreadful Zone 7.”
Finishing her statement, Bersil glanced at Einar, who immediately stepped forward with a sly smile.
“Alright, you bug-eaters! You saved us, housed us, fed us. If you were truly people, wouldn’t you express your appreciation with a battle cry?”
“... A battle cry?”
“You, you mean, Behe… Behela?”
“Of course!! If you don't want to, you can refuse! We Barbarians respect free will!”
“Well… I… I would like to refuse due to religious reasons… ”
“Oh! Then why don’t you leave the sacred grounds right now!”
“You said you respect free will!”
“Free will comes with great responsibility. Don’t you know that?”
Einar’s look of utter disdain silenced the man who’d attempted to refuse, and the same reaction spread throughout the clan leaders. It was time for Bersil to offer a carrot.
“Einar, please stop. That gentleman was simply refusing for religious reasons. He undoubtedly feels grateful to the Barbarians.”
“Oh, really?”
“Of, of course. Isn't that what any decent person would do?”
Seizing the opportunity, the man nodded eagerly. It was more advantageous to express gratitude than to shout a battle cry in front of everyone, and this sentiment seemed shared by the leaders of other clans, who each offered their own insincere words.
“Pnellin, I am truly grateful for your kindness.”
“Our Parthia clan feels the same way. We will never forget the kindness we have received.”
Observing this scene, Bersil suppressed a pleased smile.  It might seem like a simple 'expression of gratitude,' but these small acts accumulated, eventually forming a patron-client relationship.
“Gowland Deputy.”
“Yes, Erta Commander.”
“But what is the reason you have called us here this early morning? Surely you didn't gather us all just for words of thanks.”
“Ah, about that?”
As if relieved to have been asked, Bersil stepped forward.  She addressed them all in a loud voice, as if making an announcement.
“The barrier that has been protecting the sacred grounds from Zone 7 since this morning has been weakening.”
The casual mention of the barrier, which had allowed the explorers to relax since arriving, was enough to send shockwaves through their minds.
“... W, what do you mean?”
“Those Noirark bastards must have put up that barrier! They have no time for us with their war against the Royal Family!”
Technically, it wasn't 'us,' but the Barbarians stationed within the sacred grounds. Regardless, it wasn’t important.
“But why now? What is the reason…”
“The reason isn't important.”
Bersil firmly cut him off and got to the point.
“The barrier is weakening. After checking, it seems that the magic supply is being cut off, causing it to dissolve naturally.”
“Deputy, how much time remains?”
Bersil’s question was answered by a calm voice.  Was it the leader of the Lavraim clan? Unlike the other leaders, who had expressed irritation both before and after arriving at the sacred grounds, he had remained calm and rational throughout.
“It’s not certain, but I estimate about an hour.”
“An hour...”
“Anyway, we need to prepare. In my opinion, there are only two possible reasons for this sudden barrier weakening.”
“May we hear them?”
“The first is that something truly went wrong, causing the magic supply to be cut off.”
“And the second?”
In response, Bersil looked at the man who had yelled earlier.
“It means the Noirark side has gained something.”
“... ?”
“The ability to deal with us.”
Bersil considered this possibility the most likely, and could she feel it in her voice?
“... ”
“... ”
A heavy silence fell over them.  The clearing was unnaturally quiet, considering the number of people present.
It was a woman who broke the silence.
“Then… what do we do now…?”
Well.
In her heart, Bersil desperately wanted to respond with “I don’t know,” but…
“[You are the deputy leader of our clan starting today.]”
She couldn’t.
Taking a deep breath, Bersil closed her eyes and then opened them again.
“We all need to prepare to fight.”
“Can we hear your strategy?”
“Our initial priority is defense. If we build a fort near the gate and defend it, the enemy won’t be able to break through easily.”
“If that’s the initial priority, then there must be a follow-up?”
“Yes. If we see an opportunity, we need to push forward, right?”
“P, push forward…?”
The various leaders widened their eyes, seemingly taken aback by this unexpected strategy.  Bersil shrugged. 
Although her position was ‘mage’ and ‘long-range attacker,’ she now understood. 
“Yes. Attack is the best defense.”
To protect something truly precious, you need to know how to strike.

Shabin Emure, the administrative secretary of the Barbarian tribe, was busier than anyone else in the tribe at the moment. 
It was only natural.
This cursed sacred grounds, with its unfortunate location, had once again been caught in the throes of war.  Worse, she was the one responsible for (temporarily) overseeing all administrative work within the sacred grounds. 
Therefore, she had to keep her wits about her. 
“Emure, I brought you some tea. Take a moment to rest and have some.”
“... Yes, yes? But I don’t have time for… ”
“You can spare some time for a cup of tea, can’t you? Don’t feel burdened by everything yourself.”
“... I, I understand. But the enemy is about to attack! How can I relax…?”
Emure felt like she might lose her mind. After all, her expertise lay in administration and bureaucracy, not war.
“Well, if you feel that way, I won’t insist.  But I’ll leave it here. Do me a favor and sip on it occasionally, as a show of appreciation.  Sometimes, you need to force yourself to calm down for work efficiency.”
“Ah… yes… Thank you, Lotmiller.”
Was it truly just for a cup of tea? After that, Lotmiller turned and left, and Shabin Emure finally realized the change in his appearance.
“Lo, Lotmiller? What is that outfit?”
Lotmiller, usually impeccably dressed in casual attire, was somehow wearing armor. It was as if he was about to enter a labyrinth.
“Ah… you’re seeing it for the first time, Emure.  I didn’t get rid of my old gear just in case.  I think it’s a good thing now.”
“Are you… going to fight…?”
“Isn’t that necessary?  We need every hand we can get.”
“But Lotmiller, you were a scout!”
A potentially rude remark.
Lotmiller, however, smiled gently without any sign of offense.
“Haha, don’t worry too much.  Even though I was a scout, I was also an explorer.  I entered the labyrinth to protect what is precious to me.”
Looking at Lotmiller, Shabin Emure was speechless.  After all, she couldn’t really stop him.
“Anyway, I came by to say hello.  Once I head to the front lines, I won’t be able to see you until everything is over.”
In the end, there was only one thing she could say.
“... Stay safe.”
She spoke those words with genuine concern, and Lotmiller responded briefly.
“... I will return safely.”
After that, Lotmiller left the room.  Left alone, Shabin Emure blushed.
‘Re, return safely… how…!’
Even as she sipped her fragrant tea, her heart wouldn’t settle.
***
The Lion King.
There was only one person who used that title in the Round Table. 
This was the one who had been so eager to showcase his importance in the Round Table, acting as if he were the spokesperson for Auril Gavius.
‘Wolf.’
Coincidentally, the Hirkumuta mask worn by the man before him was also of a black wolf. However, this wasn’t just a coincidence.
‘He must have been part of that group from the start.’
He probably chose the wolf mask for this reason.
“Haha, don't be so wary. I am not your enemy.”
“Then why did you block my path?”
“I didn't block anything.”
“Really? Then move aside.”
Though his tone was cold, the man had no intention of stepping aside.
“I told you not to be so wary.  I’ve only come with a message from the Elder.”
The Elder was undoubtedly that old geezer, Auril Gavius.
“A message…?”
The Chinese characters for 'help' and 'words' combined.  In other words, a helpful message. 
But why did a simple message make him feel even more wary?
As if understanding that he was willing to listen, the man began his 'message.'
“Coming this way, you must be heading for the sacred grounds, right?”
“... ”
“Go that way instead.”
The man pointed towards the burning Zone 7.
He was so dumbfounded, he couldn’t even laugh.
“You said you weren’t blocking the path, but that was a lie.”
“I have no intention of blocking you. If the Lion King proceeds to the sacred grounds along this path, I will step aside.”
“Really? Then move aside.”
“If that’s what you want.”
Though he hadn’t expected it at all, the man actually stepped aside, pressing himself against the edge of the wall.
Therefore…
He slowly stepped forward, keeping an eye on the man in case he did something unexpected.
And…
He was about to step past the man when…
“Oh, and one more thing. Killing the Jester was not a good choice.”
“Does my choice matter?”
“It does. To the Lion King, at least.  The Elder said you would have been greatly helped if the Jester had lived.”
“I don’t know if it would have helped, but I know your Elder is a busybody.”
“He’s a merciful and noble man.”
Well, no wonder he’s such a big fan of Auril Gavius.
No longer seeing the value in further conversation, he continued walking, passing the man.
And…
He took one step.
He took another.
He took a third, his mind full of thoughts, when…
‘Oh, this is getting ridiculous…!’
He finally turned back and asked.
“... Why?”
He didn’t like the way the man’s eyes seemed to warp behind his mask.
“Are you telling me not to go to the sacred grounds?”
He finally spat out his question, and the man responded as if he’d been waiting for it.
“The lives of people depend on where you go.”
“... ”
“So go to Zone 7 instead of the sacred grounds. That’s the best choice for the Lion King.”
“A choice for me…?”
He chuckled and asked a single question.
“And did your Elder tell you about this future?”
“I don’t know what you're asking, but that’s all the advice I’m allowed to give you… ”
He didn’t ask for more advice.
He grabbed the man’s throat with a swift movement and shoved him towards the edge of the wall.
“Are you going to live here, or are you going to die?”
If he hits him, maybe he’ll believe it.
