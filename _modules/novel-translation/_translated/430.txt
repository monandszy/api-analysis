## The Lion's Return (1)
After the dust settled, I borrowed a dagger from Amelia and sliced open the Dragon Slayer's abdomen.
*Swoosh-*
The gash, like a line drawn with a surgical scalpel, revealed his insides. After completing the impromptu surgery, I calmly extracted his heart. Despite the frigid environment, it was still fresh.
"So, dragon hearts are different from human ones, huh?"
The surface resembled a bumpy tropical fruit, except the bumps looked more like the scars of a rusty chain.
As I continued to examine the curious organ, Ravien, who had been watching me intently, spoke, "The chain marks are probably from Fen's curse."
Hmm, is that so? But the bumpy texture… that must be natural, then?
"Goul, prepare the preservation and distortion magic."
I distorted the heart before placing it in a suitable chest for safekeeping. Ravien seemed eager to take charge of it, but I intervened.
"I'll keep this for now."
"…Why?"
"It's a bargaining chip."
"You won't return it right away?"
"That's right. After things have calmed down, I'll meet with the current Ancient Dragon and negotiate a pact before handing it over. We need to be discreet about this. Spreading rumors about this heart could be disastrous."
Ravien, though slightly concerned, surprisingly agreed. 
"I understand. I'd rather you handle this. You'll likely get a much better deal than I could. Of course, it's a bit unfair to Fen, but it's not like he'll have to wait for long…"
"I appreciate your understanding."
Okay, that's that then.
After securing the heart, we held a funeral.  Though we no longer had any priests to conduct the rites, we stood in solemn silence, like we had before, and cremated the fallen members. Then, we moved on to the more practical task of collecting the spoils of war.
"Gather all our fallen comrades' equipment. We can't use the pocket dimension, so cram everything into the bags."
We collected the fallen comrades' gear, our mementos.
"Space is limited, so choose only the valuable equipment from the Noir arc's side."
I decided to take only a few of the Noir arc's belongings.  After all, we'd killed so many of them before reaching the Ice Eye.  Those spoils are already safely tucked away in our pocket dimensions. Even if they ask where we got them, there's no way to prove whether they're from this mission or not.  The gear from the Rose Knights is a different story.
"Keep the Rose Knight's gear separate. We need to manage it carefully."
Their equipment and supplies are mostly military grade. Selling them or using them ourselves is restricted.  The moment these goods hit the market, the royal family will get wind of it.
'Or, worse, if they start snooping around our pockets immediately, claiming to be checking for leftover spoils, the entire plan will fall apart.'
It's not a 100% certainty, but the risk is there.
"Well, we definitely earned enough for our war chest…"
Kaislan, a former soldier, seemed satisfied with the substantial increase in the clan's budget.  Although, seeing him tear up over the fallen comrades was a bit humorous, almost manic.
"Don't let guilt consume you, Jandel. Fulfill their desires. That is what matters."
"What are you talking about? My nose is just running because of the cold."
Ugh, back to different thoughts… different thoughts…
I abruptly stopped, turning towards the pile of Rose Knight corpses and equipment.  I had no intention of taking anything, but…
'Just a quick look at what they've got, right?'
Perhaps I could find something that might be a weakness of the royal family, or some crucial information… I thoroughly inspected their belongings, and my greed grew with each discovery.
'Wow, all the daggers are made of Mistium. The leather is all Ogre hide…'
How could I leave this behind?
Maybe I could sneak some out, melt them down, and make some new gear?
The desire was overwhelming, but…
"Let it go. This one."
I couldn't take even a 1% risk.
I could explain away the Dragon Slayer's heart as loot acquired during our chase through the Ice Eye, but not this.
"……Huh?"
As I rummaged through the Rose Knights' bodies, I tilted my head in confusion.
'These rings… what are they?'
I noticed identical rings worn on the middle fingers of every fallen Knight.
'Were they wearing rings? Why don't I remember that?'
I tried to recall the fight against this woman, Six, but she wasn't wearing them.
'What the hell?'
Immediately, I removed every ring from the corpses. They weren't numbered items.
Could they be magical tools?
"Marone, Goul."
I asked the mages to identify them.  The results arrived quickly.
"They're subordination magic tools. The moment you put one on, your physical form disappears, and it binds to your soul."
"Subordination magic tool?"
"You know, the summoning inscription we used to summon a ship from the 6th floor abyss. That's one of the most famous subordination magic tools."
"So… this ring…?"
"It's a pocket dimension ring. And not your average magic tool. This is on a whole other level."
No wonder there weren't any Knights wearing pocket dimension rings or bracelets.
"Normally, subordination magic tools leave marks like tattoos, but this one doesn't. It seems like a detection cancellation circuit is engraved on it too."
"Does that mean even the royal family wouldn't be able to detect this pocket dimension?"
"Yes. Probably."
Jackpot.
***
I don't know what's inside this bonded pocket dimension.
But one thing's for sure.
It's a huge win, even if I don't know what's in it.
With this ring, I can ditch all the Rose Knights' gear and still have enough space.
"Take it all!"
I collected all the Rose Knights' gear and stuffed it into my bag.
If I pack it all up and dump it into the pocket dimension as soon as we reach the city, those bastards won't have a clue.
'The problem is, we only have seven pocket dimensions…'
We have a total of ten people in the squad now.
Three of us won't get the ring.
Surprisingly, the distribution of the pocket dimensions went smoothly.
"…It's too big a prize for me to receive, considering I couldn't participate in the fight."
James Calla, who had been sidelined due to his blindness, declined the ring.
"I'll pass as well. I already have a subordination pocket dimension."
"Me too."
Akuraba and Ravien, who already had similar items, also declined.
And so, the owner was decided.
[The character has equipped the Rose of the Liar ring.]
[The Rose of the Liar ring binds to the character.]
The moment I put it on, the ring shone and disappeared.
"How do you open the pocket dimension?"
"It's brainwave recognition. Just think about opening it, and it'll open."
Wow, is this the latest technology of the royal family?
This is going to be super useful.
"Okay, we've pretty much wrapped things up."
We finished collecting the spoils and mementos.
[The frozen wall melts away.]
The moment the sealed room opened up after a day, we all left the battlefield together.
We did find some food in the Rose Knights' bags, but it was nowhere near enough for ten people.
[Versil Goul has cast the 6th grade space magic [Upper Distortion].]
[Lilys Marone has cast the 6th grade space magic [Upper Distortion].]
We maximized our monster meat haul, and I headed towards the Ice Eye.
But…
"What a shame.  If I could have brought back everything down there, I could have even afforded a mansion in the Imperial Capital."
We had to turn back because the Ice Eye mage, Kariadea, was standing right there.
How much equipment is buried down there?
I don't know, but it'll all vanish when the dungeon closes.
"Alright, let's rest here for the day."
Collecting meat is important, but it's better to take frequent breaks rather than rushing.
After all, we have enough time before we starve to death, and…
The members are still in poor shape.
"Kaislan, are you alright?"
"I'm fine. Don't worry. I can hold out until we leave."
We didn't have any priests, and only four potions.
Everyone survived, but several members suffered serious injuries, and their effects are still lingering.
Erwen is completely drained, both in mana and nature, and can't even cast a single skill.
Only a handful of us are fully combat-ready.
"But… despite everything, I feel strangely energized…"
"Oh, I agree."
"I always thought I'd experienced enough in life, but looking back, it all seems so trivial compared to this."
We exchanged idle chatter during our rest, but mostly, we discussed the future.
"Will you create the clan right away?"
"Probably. But everyone joining will come later."
"Of course… Lord Kaislan is from the military. He can't just leave so easily."
"It wouldn't be different even if it wasn't Kaislan. It would be strange if we suddenly coalesced as a group. We need to give it some time. They'll probably reject us first if we wait long enough, and it's not too late to form a group later."
"Hey, I thought of a clan emblem."
"Wow, Lady Marone, you have some real talent!"
We went over the scenarios, discussing the clan we'll create and everything from the beginning of the expedition to now.  We fine-tuned the details, ironing out any inconsistencies and resolving any concerns together.
"Jandel, I have one worry."
"Tell me."
"No matter how much we coordinate our stories, will the royal family really believe us?"
"…"
"We all resisted the verification magic, but there are other ways to uncover the truth, you know."
This was something I'd been pondering myself.
What if they didn't believe us?
What if they had doubts and wanted to confirm the facts before they moved on?
"Like I said before, the royal family wouldn't go that far. They don't want to stir up trouble for no reason."
"Yes… usually, that's the case. Asking those questions themselves would be like giving us something to be suspicious of… But what if they choose to take that risk?"
"Even so… it doesn't matter.  After all, the core of this plan wasn't to deceive the royal family."
Plan A is the best, but even with Plan B, it's not like everything is completely doomed.
"Huh? What do you mean?"
"The fact that we coordinated our stories and kept silent is a signal to them. We're telling them we'll just let it go, so don't bother us anymore. It's like a plea from the weak."
This incident involves the Duke, the Marquis, the alliance of minor nobles, the Alminous Corporation, the Explorer's Guild, and even the adventurers guild.
Even if they suspect what happened in the dungeon, they won't bother to confirm it. And even if they do, they're unlikely to take drastic measures.
I'll make sure to create a bigger fuss before that happens.
Once everyone's eyes are on me, they'll be a little more cautious.
Just like when they granted me a noble title without verification.
That's how the royal family works.
"We need to grow stronger within that timeframe.  Make them see that it's better to overlook us than to attack us."
"But wouldn't that be more dangerous?  The bigger we get, the more they'll fear us."
"I doubt it."
"Why?"
"Because no matter how big we get, we're just a small candle flame compared to the royal family."
Their power is immense.
Sane people don't consider taking up arms against the royal family.
That's why...
"They'll just think we're struggling to survive. They won't think we're prepared to stick a knife in their throat."
Just one dungeon expedition.
Before this, we were all strangers.
Who would think we'd defy the royal family in order to avenge them?
Sadness and anger are fleeting emotions.
People are usually grateful to be alive and make pragmatic decisions.
But…
"What if, hypothetically..."
Akuraba, who seemed to agree with me to a certain extent, brought up the worst-case scenario.
"What if… they see us as a threat and try to eliminate us?"
The answer is simple.
What are we going to do?
We'll go with Plan C then.
***
The 75th day of entering the dungeon.
Or more accurately, [22:10].
Only four hours left until the dungeon closes.  We've been looking forward to this moment for so long.
"What's going on?"
Versil Goul sat beside me during our rest and asked, seemingly out of the blue.
"Jandel, Naria was a demon, wasn't she?"
"She was likely one, yes."
"I see… I knew it…"
Versil muttered, and I remained silent, having no suitable response. Versil spoke again after a brief silence.
"Jandel, what do you think of Naria?"
A question filled with cautiousness.
"I think of her as a comrade who died tragically. But… what are you trying to ask?"
"I'll rephrase the question. If Naria had lived until now, would you still consider her a comrade?"
I could see the implication behind the question, but I answered honestly.
"Of course."
"…Even if she was a demon?"
"Are we really going to care about something like that after choosing to oppose the royal family? Demon or not, I don't care.  All that matters is whether I can trust someone or not."
"I see."
Versil nodded with a peculiar expression before resuming our light-hearted conversation and leaving shortly after.
Hmm, what was her goal?
Was she just curious about me as a person?
'Could it be that she figured out the Goblin was a demon? And she was trying to gauge my reaction to that?'
It seemed like a plausible theory.
At least, until Amelia pulled me aside two hours later.
"Jandel, can I have a word?"
"Did something happen?"
"It's about that task you gave me."
Ah, that?
I had indeed requested a favor.  I couldn't help but feel uneasy about Sven Parav's reckless behavior at the Roundtable.  I planned to keep a close eye on him and manage him closely.
But…
"That was about outside, wasn't it…?"
It wasn't even a request to investigate.  It was a gentle plea to keep an eye on him.
What's this about?
"I should be grateful for that misunderstanding."
Amelia chuckled and shrugged her shoulders, her manner suggestive of a strong hand.
My mind instantly went into overdrive.
"You found something, haven't you?"
"…If you're curious, find out for yourself."
Amelia unfastened her belt.
I was surprised by the sudden move, but then Amelia fidgeted with her belt and pulled out a small crystal ball.
"This is…."
"A recording crystal."
As if I didn't know that.
I was just surprised to find such an item hidden in her belt, which she wore all the time.
'…Is she a peeping tom?'
I suppressed the urge to tease her and activated the crystal ball Amelia handed me.
First things first, I needed to see this.
[…Chew, creak, chew.]
The video began with Sven Parav secretly munching on jerky, hidden under his clothes, away from the group.
Anger boiled over in my heart.
"This bastard, he told me he didn't have any jerky stashed away…."
"Quiet and watch. You'll see soon enough."
"…"
Amelia's stern tone silenced me, and the video changed.
[Sven Parav.]
A woman approached the man, who had his back turned.
[Hick!]
The man was startled, caught red-handed while eating jerky.
[Can I talk to you for a moment?]
The woman speaking was, surprisingly, Versil. Sven Parav just kept looking around nervously, not answering.
[I'll tell you upfront, I have no intention of telling anyone about your jerky.  I just want to talk for a bit.]
[…Can't it wait?]
[You don't want to talk to me?]
[Ah, it's not that… It just feels… very unpleasant….]
[What are you talking about?]
Versil tilted her head, as if she didn't understand what he meant, but I was just impressed.
'Did he instinctively feel Amelia was watching?'
I couldn't tell, but the video kept playing.
[Anyway, let's just get to the point and finish this quickly.]
[Yes? Ah, yes… speak. I'll listen.]
[I know you're a demon.]
Just one sentence.
"…"
[…What?]
Both me and Sven Parav in the video froze in disbelief.
And…
[…Gulp! Cough, cough, cough!]
[Be quiet. Someone might hear.]
Crazy, he's coming out as a demon here?
[…What? But, but, but… I'm a demon? How—!]
The bombshell didn't stop there.
[Don't even think about running. I'm a demon too.]
Damn, is she coming out here?
[…What? Goul… you're a demon…?]
Sven Parav was completely speechless.
Goul, calmly addressing the man, continued,
[It's simple.  I figured if you're the type who makes mistakes, you might slip up and say something on the community.]
[Uh, uh…]
[Don't you dare mention anything about this expedition. I'll be watching you.  Community boards, the Roundtable, anywhere.]
Boom-!
There was no such sound effect, but I and Sven Parav could hear it in our heads.
[Wow, the Roundtable? How did you—]
[Of course I know.  I'm a member too. How else would I know you're a demon?]
[Hold on… there's a woman there… The… the Queen? But she doesn't feel like that….]
Sven Parav, frantically trying to calm himself, raised a finger.
[Could… could it be… that you are… Fox…?]
That was the last scene before I stopped the video.
'Versil Goul is Fox…'
It was another prize from this expedition.
***
[The dungeon has closed.]
[The character is transported to Laphdonia.]
***
The warm sunlight.
The Marquis, sitting at his desk and reviewing documents, set down his pen and grabbed a steaming cup of tea.
He took a sip and checked the time.
'The portal should be opening soon.'
Five minutes left until 12 pm.
The dungeon will close soon, and the empty dimensional plaza will soon be filled with explorers who have completed their arduous journey.
It was a scene he saw every month, but today felt different.
"I hope the mission was a success."
The Eye of the Sky, the Noir arc's key strategic weapon.
A thirty-person expedition team hastily formed to destroy it.
"Well, it doesn't matter if they failed."
The Marquis had already prepared documents for two scenarios.
One, the mission was successful, but the expedition team did not survive.  The other, the mission failed, and they didn't survive either.
There was no document prepared for their survival.
He might be cautious by nature, but he had no interest in pointless effort.
"Finally, the feeling of having a toothache removed."
The Marquis chuckled and set down his teacup.
He picked up his pen again and continued reviewing his pending tasks.
More than ten minutes passed.
Woo woo woo woo-!
The message stone on his desk vibrated.
The sender was the checkpoint, connected to the Marquisate.
"What's going on?"
The Marquis's face contorted in an instant.  He didn't need much time to process this.
[…I apologize for the interruption, but a group claiming to be a special unit of the royal family has appeared.]
"……Special unit?"
[Ah, yes… Did you not know? I apologize.  It's hard to call them delusional, as their identities are all quite impressive….]
"So that's what happened…."
[Yes. The man who seems to be leading them is demanding to speak with you immediately, almost shouting… What should we do?]
"Is that so? I understand. I'll send someone soon.  Keep them there.  Oh, and how many are there?"
[Ten… exactly ten.]
"I see. I understand."
The Marquis answered with a friendly tone and ended the call.
Then...
*Zi Zi Zi Zi Zi-*
He tore up both documents on his desk and burned them.
"Ten people…."
I have no idea how they managed it.
"This is getting interesting."
Those who were supposed to be dead have returned.
