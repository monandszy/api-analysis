## The Evil Spirit's Daughter
Long ago, in the past. Though time has passed to the point where it wouldn't be strange to call it ancient history, the memories remain vivid. 
The first rift I entered, the Bloodstained Citadel, after awakening in a Barbarian's body. There, I met Raven and Hicuroad. With a body devoid of essence, I engaged in a fierce battle against Cambormier, the Vampire Duke, a 5th-grade monster and guardian of the rift. 
Naturally, I remember the conversation we had then.
"Strange, truly strange..." 
Even then, he uttered words similar to what he said just now, gazing upon us.
"Seeing you ignites a thirst for blood within me, I can't contain it. Do you perhaps know the reason?"
He possessed intellect and could communicate. It wasn't an unusual occurrence. Among the higher-tier mutated creatures, there were many who could speak.  Of course, this was the first time I heard Cambormier speak in such a manner...
'At that time, I simply accepted it as a fact.'
Back then, the Bloodstained Citadel was my first rift encounter.  Moreover, it was my first time facing Cambormier. So, I didn't dwell on the matter deeply. 
But...
"I cannot fail. I must not lose...!"
The Knight of Apocalypse, whom I met in the white shrine's hut. He was more desperate than any monster I had faced.
"If it's a lie that no one knows... What's the difference between that and the truth?"
The Doppelganger, the guardian of the 4th-floor rift. In the end, he uttered words filled with regret. 
"...Truly remarkable. To grasp the laws of the world, even faintly."
The mysterious being I encountered in the reward chamber after conquering Dreadfear also spoke with meaningful words.
"You mustn't open the abyssal gate."
And let's not forget the Ground Witch, Eliss Groundia.
As I ascended to higher floors, I encountered various beings, and my questions grew with each encounter. What is this labyrinth? What are the guardians and the layer lords? What awaits beyond the abyssal gate?
'Perhaps...'
The answer to these questions might be right here, I had a sudden intuition as I met this vampire.
"Hmm, do you not understand me?"
His voice carried more curiosity than suspicion.  Before that curiosity faded, I ended my reverie and spoke.
"As you said, we have met before. In the Bloodstained Citadel."
"The Bloodstained Citadel..."
The vampire quietly pondered the name, then looked back at me, muttering.
"So, you have no memory? It must have been after I became like this."
His response sent a shiver down my spine. My apprehension grew, but he was genuinely engaging in a normal conversation with me.
'He doesn't seem to be losing his mind suddenly.'
But, I couldn't know how long this state would last, so I quickly continued the conversation. 
"What do you mean, 'like this'?"
"Don't you see? This monstrous body."
He seemed to be referring to his transformed body as a vampire. I was expecting something like being trapped in the labyrinth or captured by the witch, but...
'So, this old man was human before?'
I wanted to clarify this point, but unfortunately, the vampire's question came too soon.
"So, where is this place? Why am I here?"
Honestly, I was unsure what to answer. 
"Surely, our Duke Cambormier family is ablaze, attacked by the Three Gods sect..."
An invisible barrier stood between our conversation.  It felt like a past human and a future human, meeting by chance and conversing without knowing each other's circumstances.
"...This is the labyrinth. I encountered you while exploring within it."
"The labyrinth... What is it?"
Our conversation faltered due to the clashing understanding.  So, I cautiously asked.
"Before explaining... Could you tell me your story first?"
"My story... You mean?"
"Anything is fine. I'm just curious about your last memory."
"Hmm..."
The vampire, after a moment of contemplation, slowly began to speak.
"The Three Gods sect's army came to subjugate me. I was defeated in that battle and closed my eyes, seeking rest.  And now I have awakened."
"..."
"Upon awakening, I saw you... A memory of our encounter surfaced from somewhere. Oh, by the way, the madness that tormented me is still absent. It's been so long since I was this mentally sound..."
"..."
"So tell me. This place where I am now... This place you call the labyrinth, where is it?"
"Can I take a moment to gather my thoughts before answering?"
"Certainly."
With the vampire's permission, I hastily synthesized the available clues. Not just what he said, but also the information I already possessed.
"The Dark Continent is a real place."
The information the jester, who had gone beyond the walls, revealed at the round table.
"The Three Gods sect's army came to subjugate me."
The Three Gods sect, who exists in our world and still reigns strong... and so on.
It didn't take long to arrive at a conclusion, though, it was all just my conjecture.
The labyrinth was based on real events and locations. And...
"Cambormier, listen carefully, don't be surprised."
"I'm listening."
"...First, the truth is, thousands of years have passed since your death."
"..."
"What does that mean? I'm clearly alive now!"
From this point onward, it was all my speculation.
"No, you are already dead. And the current you... It's highly likely you are a being created by someone else."
"...I simply don't understand."
For the first time, a hint of hostility flickered in the vampire's eyes. It was a reaction I anticipated.  After all, who would react favorably when a stranger suddenly declares, "You're already dead?"
' ...This method is difficult, isn't it?'
There was an easier way.  I could deceive him, tell him what he wanted to hear, while concealing the truth.  If I had done that, I could have obtained the desired information more easily.
However, despite knowing that, I revealed my conjecture without any hidden agenda.  In a way, it was a very Barbarian-like reason. 
I didn't want to do it that way. 
It was time for me to graduate from that method.
If I want to be someone who can express their anger justly when faced with injustice... 
"Cambormier, calm down and listen. I'll explain why I think this way."
Sometimes, you need to be able to choose the difficult path.
***
Following that, I spent a considerable amount of time explaining to the vampire.
What the labyrinth is.
What form the current city takes, and how the world has changed.
What I saw and experienced while exploring the labyrinth.
Finally... the circumstances of our first encounter.
Explaining all of that was a far more laborious and time-consuming task than I imagined. 
The vampire struggled to grasp the chasm of knowledge spanning thousands of years, sometimes denying my words with a hint of fury.
But...
"...Stop it. I understand now. Why you said such things."
In the end, the vampire raised the white flag.
But was this the only question?
"However, there's something I don't understand."
"...What is it? Tell me. I'll explain as many times asâ€”."
"Why are you telling me all this so earnestly? As you said, I'm just a created being. Perhaps even today's events will be erased from memory. Just like I forgot our encounter that day."
It wasn't an expected question, but I answered honestly again.
"...If I were you, I would still want to know the truth."
"..."
"That's why I told you. If I'm honest with you first, perhaps I can also get your help."
"Is that so..."
The vampire seemed to contemplate for a while before finally speaking.
"Then tell me. What would you like me to do for you?"
The words I had been waiting for.
I took a deep breath and spoke.
"Cambormier, I want to know about you."
"About me... You mean?"
"Yes. How you lived, what your world was like, and what happened to you. Just like I told you, everything. All of it."
The vampire seemed surprised by my unexpected request, but he nodded with a serious expression.
"I will. It's awkward to tell my life to a stranger, but as you said, I'm just a puppet, right? It's better to be remembered by someone... even if it's someone like you."
"..."
"Still, asking me to talk about my life out of the blue... Well, where should I start...? Ah, this is probably a good place to begin..."
"..."
"I had a daughter."
And so, the old man's story began.
The estimated time was before the witch's curse engulfed the world. 
"It was a time of chaos. Those who followed the witch, and the empire's army, fought and bled day and night."
The story of the witch and humans clashing was familiar to me. 
However, his following tales held great significance for me. After all, ancient records were rare and nearly lost.
"Our Cambormier family, a ducal house of a borderland principality, was relatively less affected by that war.  We remained neutral, neither siding with the witch nor the empire, and silently waited for the day the war would end."
Then one day...
"My only daughter fell ill."
A dreadful disease that defied potions and even high priest's divine power.  As days passed, her life force dwindled, and the duke couldn't bear to watch.
"She was a child I wouldn't hesitate to give my soul for."
The duke searched high and low, eventually reaching out to the witch's followers.  And they proposed a way to save his daughter.
"Later I learned, they weren't actually followers of the witch. They were servants of the evil god Karui, driving the world into chaos."
The duke, unaware of this, accepted their proposal. The empire had accumulated numerous evil deeds, and he had heard countless tales of humans becoming followers of the witch to seek salvation. 
The duke held a neutral stance towards the witch.
"That was the beginning of all our misfortune."
Karui's priests treated his daughter with an uncanny method. Her room was filled with screams day after day.
One day, his daughter begged him to stop, but the duke ignored her, claiming it was all for her sake.
And as time passed...
"My daughter awoke from her sickbed."
His daughter recovered, and Karui's priests departed. 
The duke, initially overjoyed at the return to normalcy, soon faced the shattering of his happiness.
The duke spoke calmly.
"She began to swell."
Literally, his daughter swelled up.  As if pus were filling her entire body, slowly and steadily.
"When she got wounded and bled, everything around her corroded and melted.  She also became irrational and violent."
The duke imprisoned his daughter in an underground dungeon. 
It was unavoidable. If the news of his daughter's transformation spread, it would endanger both the Cambormier family and his daughter.
He planned to keep her hidden and find a way to heal her. 
"However, the problem was that she wouldn't eat."
No matter how delicious the food he offered, no matter how forcefully he tried to shove it down her throat, his daughter wouldn't accept it.
"I could feel her dying day by day.  She had no energy, couldn't even open her eyes.  When I checked her pulse, I could tell her heart was failing."
The duke was powerless.
One day, while helplessly watching his daughter fade...
"...One of the knights, while bringing her food, was attacked and killed by her."
"..."
"Then, she finally... ate."
There was no need to ask what she ate.
"That child, who would flinch even when a fly landed on her... was eating.  Gluttonously."
The duke fainted at the sight, but his daughter regained her strength from that day forward.
The duke, needing time to find a solution, brought criminals to feed to his daughter.
But the more she ate, the larger she grew.
The underground dungeon couldn't contain her, so he moved her to a place used for water storage.
The amount she consumed increased, exceeding what criminals could provide, forcing him to frame and bring in innocent people. 
"If it had been the original me, I would never have made such a foolish choice. But... Those who followed the evil god had done something to me as well."
The duke at the time was incapable of rational thought.
His violent tendencies were awakened, his sense of guilt lessened.
He experienced bouts of madness.
These changes didn't just affect his mind, but his body as well.
His fangs grew.
His sense of smell sharpened.
Whenever he smelled blood, his mouth would water.
He could use black magic, which he had never learned, and moved his transformed body effortlessly, as if a butterfly flapping its wings.
Finding food for his daughter became easier.
As disappearances became frequent, and his loyal servants deserted one by one, his home became known as the Bloodstained Citadel. 
Naturally, the news spread to the empire, who was at war with the witch, and even to the Three Gods sect.
"And after that, it's the story I already told. The army invaded, and I was defeated."
The duke, consumed by his cruel nature, had created a secret space in the depths of his castle for his private pleasure.
It was there that a holy knight's blade pierced his heart.
"Ironically, I prayed."
On the verge of death, the duke prayed. The gods of the Three Gods sect would never forgive him.
"To the witch, who was called the enemy of mankind, I begged for salvation.  I prayed and prayed, even if it was only to save my daughter.  And when I woke up, I was here."
He realized later that the incident was, from his perspective, something that just happened.  
But how could he speak so calmly about it?
I cautiously asked, and the duke shook his head, saying he didn't know.
"I don't know... but it feels like a terribly long time has passed.  If what you said is true, it seems many years have actually gone by..."
When I was speechless and simply listened, the old man asked me.
"Do you know? What you told me today was a truly cruel truth."
I understand it completely.
That's what I thought, but I didn't voice it.  Because, I couldn't have possibly understood it fully.  Hearing his story made that thought even stronger.
"But..."
The vampire said.
"Thank you, though. For being honest with me."
"..."
"Because of you, I can avoid having a false dream."
It was a truly strange feeling.
