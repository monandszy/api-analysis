## Chapter 671: The Star Grave (2)
Deadred, the Dark Lord. A single line would suffice to explain his power: he is the monarch of the 7th layer, the Dark Continent. Although, curiously, the 7th layer has two monarchs… but that doesn't diminish their individual strength. 
Anyway.
"How in the world did this guy get his hands on that... ?" 
Frankly, I couldn't comprehend it. Unlike the cheat version where one could simply overpower foes with pure essence, in the original difficulty,  "that method" remained inaccessible unless one knew the secret. Had I been underestimating Baekho all this time? Maybe this guy is actually impressive. 
"...Or maybe he's just incredibly lucky."
The details surrounding the acquisition of Deadred's essence remain shrouded in mystery, but considering everything, he likely obtained it long ago. After all... 
"The last time he was summoned was almost eight years ago."
Given the constant influx of adventurers in the Labyrinth, secretly summoning a layer monarch is impossible. Therefore, he wouldn't have had the opportunity within the last eight years,  unless it was through a natural method, of course. 
"The royal family probably keeps a layer essence or two in their test tubes, right?"
Perhaps Baekho acquired it through some sort of exchange. It doesn't seem likely, given the circumstances. 
"...So, it really did happen that day."
Baekho, who dreamed of a harem and embarked on Labyrinth exploration, was ultimately betrayed by his comrades, revealing his true identity.  Remarkably, this incident occurred around the same time he obtained the essence. That's why I thought the royal family was using the layer monarch as a scapegoat to cover up the incident related to Baekho.  I heard a lot of adventurers were dying in the Labyrinth during that time. 
"It was definitely Baekho who summoned it." 
My intuition tells me Baekho must have been the one to summon the layer monarch. After all, when cornered, one must make a risky move to shake things up, no matter the cost.
"Its power is terrifying, even after all this time…."
Aures, standing beside me, sighed and mumbled,  still lost in thought.  
"Is anyone hurt...?"
It seems to be his habit to inquire about his companions' well-being, being the tank, after all.
"I'm fine."
"Me too."
Jeina, the healer, and Briet, the archer, recovered their senses and responded to Aures's question. However, GM, who was still being carried like a burden on my back, was different.  Was he still in a daze?
"...Wh, what the hell was that just now...?"
What is he, someone who hasn't even encountered the Dark Lord in his gaming career?  I instantly recognized the skill upon seeing it.
"I, I've never even heard of such an ability...!" 
I understood his expression, void of any soul. I had never actually seen it before myself, and the power sent shivers down my spine. How much more chilling it must have been for him, someone who had never even heard of its existence.
*Chiiiizzzzt!*
The heavy rain evaporated upon contact with the residual heat on the ground, creating steam that rose high into the air like a wildfire. Of course, it didn't last long. The heat quickly dissipated, the steam vanished, and visibility returned.
"... " 
The crater was significantly larger than the one created by a single meteorite. Baekho stood alone inside, silhouetted against the darkening sky. 
"Surprise!"
Baekho looked up at us, grinning mischievously, and waved.  This guy always seems so carefree, but... 
"You wouldn't believe a nuclear weapon is hidden behind that smile."
Perhaps it's time to reconsider my assessment of him. I had confidently assumed he wouldn't be an easy opponent, but now... 
"What are you all doing? It's over, come here!"
Baekho called out, and we approached the crater.
"Old Man Ruin, take care of this first! It must be really expensive, right?"
Baekho pointed excitedly at a white orb lying in the center of the crater.
*Chizzzt!*
The orb shimmered with dancing electricity inside.  If I had to compare it to something in the modern world, it would be akin to a plasma ball – you know, the kind you find in fortune teller shops as a decorative piece.
"This is... the Thunder Orb."
"Ah, right, that's what it's called. So how much is this thing worth?"
"It's a treasure beyond valuation for mages."
"No, I mean, how much?"
Baekho's persistent questioning prompted Ruin to provide an approximate estimate.  Baekho's eyes widened in surprise.
"Whoa, it's that expensive? I'd be in big trouble if I'd lost it."
I could sympathize with Baekho's relief. The skill that wiped out an entire 70-meter radius space wasn't just any ordinary ability.  If it had been an ordinary monster, the orb would have been destroyed along with the rest, leaving no loot.
"Huh? Can we just pick this up?"
"I've never actually seen this before, but I think the magical treatment isn't necessary when dealing with this type of loot."
"Ah, okay...  Then give it to me."
The dropped Thunder Orb instantly disappeared into Baekho's dimensional pocket.  I felt a pang of envy, but I decided not to complain.  It wasn't just because Baekho is stronger than I expected.
"I guess we should pay him for showing us that skill."
After all, it was a secret weapon he kept hidden. If Baekho had held back and never revealed it, the battle would have been much more difficult.  And besides, the Thunder Orb wasn't urgently needed right now. 
"I can make a hammer out of that when I go full-fledged Barbarian... ."
I've already acquired the No.87 Crawling Demon Breaker, so it wouldn't be that useful, and no one in our party needs a thunder-based weapon anyway.  So, I decided not to demand a share this time.  After all, if I really want something, I can use this as leverage later. 
"Okay, so we're done looting...  let's get back to work."
Baekho finished looting and immediately turned to the broken tombstone in the crater.
"Thankfully, it's still in one piece. Should I just toss this into my dimensional pocket? It seems like valuable material."
His words had a distinct sense of changing the subject.  
"Is he trying to avoid talking about the [Star's Demise]?"
I couldn't know for sure, but his attitude prevented me from asking about the essence. 
"...Actually, it wouldn't matter if I asked anyway."
In any case, I was also curious about the tombstone, so I hurried over to them. Baekho and Aures were trying to shove the tombstone into a dimensional pocket, but...
"Out of the way.  I'll help."
With me joining them, the tombstone, heavier than a thousand pounds, was easily lifted.  And then...
"What the—?!"
The moment it touched the edge of the dimensional pocket, it was repelled with tremendous force, flying back out. 
*Woosh!*
The tombstone landed with a heavy thud, partially embedded in the ground. 
"Damn it! What the hell is this?!"
Baekho exclaimed, while GM crouched in front of the tombstone.
"...It's quite unique. I don't feel any magical circuits or similar properties within, but the dimensional pocket exhibits such a strong rejection reaction to it."
"It definitely seems suspicious, right?"
"Yes... It seems we need to investigate it further, over time."
"What do you think? I want to study this for a while... Oh, Lord 얀델, you agree, right?"
Baekho naturally attempted to reclaim the initiative, and I chuckled while nodding in agreement.
"Yes, I agree."
Heavy rain poured down, and meteorites continued to fall – a dangerous area, but perhaps this is the key to returning to our original location. 
"Uh... so I'm going to start by analyzing its components. Aures?  Could you hold this for a moment?"
"Of course, my Lord!"
And time flew by...
***
The 9th layer, the Star Grave. 
Strictly speaking, it's a very similar place, but anyway...  This wasn't a good environment for conducting in-depth research.
*Shooosh*
The rain poured down like a storm, the water level rising to the point of flooding. 
*Boom!*
Meteorites continued to fall,  along with thunder, snow, strong winds, hail, earthquakes, and hurricanes... It was a natural disaster paradise.  On top of that, we had to constantly fight monsters that kept appearing. 
The problem was... 
"Hey, we've been at it for a week, shouldn't we have figured something out by now?"
"... "
"Old Man Ruin, even I wouldn't have thought you were so clueless. If you can't do it, just say so. At least tell us so we don't waste our time, okay?"
Despite a week of intense investigation, the only thing we had learned about the tombstone was that it was incredibly strong.  However, we did make progress elsewhere.
"We've gained a deeper understanding of the monsters in this place, through repeated battles."
The "Threat Level" indicator was completely useless here.  It wasn't because of any field effects or similar things that reset the "Threat Level" to 0. It was simply because...
"It seems these monsters are highly intelligent." 
The monsters initially charged at us with excitement, but when they saw we were holding our own, they quickly shifted their focus to the damage dealers in our party.  They were learning, adapting, as if they were studying us. 
"Since they don't properly aggro, it feels like the difficulty is three or four times higher."
It wasn't that every battle was a life-or-death struggle.  Sometimes, it was actually dangerous, though…  But as the saying goes, humans are the most adaptable creatures.
"There's a monster ahead, to the north-north-east!"
"...Redithrous."
"Everyone to your positions!"
Instead of charging ahead alone as the main tank, I stayed near the party, acting as a defensive wall. And then...
"It's just one monster! Don't rush, focus on protecting everyone!"
We used the fact that there were significantly fewer monsters here than in regular fields, minimizing risks during battles.
"Hey, why are you trying to collect every single piece of loot from a level 5 mob?  We have no space! Just throw away anything bulky!"
"They may be low level, but they're very rare materials. Once we return to the city..."
"You're so greedy! Even if we just bring back what we need, we'll still make a killing."
"... "
We prioritized collecting particularly valuable loot, discarding most of the rest.  After all, it'll be at least a few months before we return to the city, and we'll need space in our inventory then.  It was a decision to save time.
"...So, Lord 얀델, what's the plan?"
"I think it's time we move on from this investigation."
"Where to?"
"I think it's best to just keep moving in one direction."
"Yeah, maybe that's better.  But which way are we going?"
We were currently on the 9th layer, the Star Grave, specifically in the central area known as the "Ancient Land."  Incidentally,  you could summon and defeat the "Ancient Dragon" here if you met certain conditions, but... 
"I'm going to pass on that. Game over the moment you summon it..."
I mentioned the place I had in mind.
"West."
"West from here... the Old Rock Prairie? Why there?"
The reason is simple.
"The 'Spirit's Gate' is in the Old Rock Prairie."
"Ah, so you're trying to see where that leads."
"Well, it's not even certain if it exists."
"Oh, I see.  I thought you were suggesting we go there for the level 8 insignia material!"
...This guy is sharp. 
"Enough, let's go already.  I don't think we'll find anything else worth investigating here."
"Yes, sir!  Everyone heard that? Let's go!"
With the situation resolved, we moved west as planned. After four days, we arrived at our destination, the Old Rock Prairie. And then...
"...Damn it. I never expected to be blocked off here."
Halfway through the Old Rock Prairie, a dead end blocked our path.
*Shooosh*
It was the same grayish, lifeless world we encountered at the Laphdonia coast, where everything had lost its color. 
"Don't go near it. You'll instantly die the moment you touch it." 
Oh, so if we push Baekho into it, he'll die?  That thought crossed my mind, but I didn't attempt it.  Our priority was escaping from here.
"We should go around this boundary line, for now."
We continued to move, keeping the boundary line to our left.
One day, two days, three days, four days...  Then, two weeks.
We were moving quickly, but we became increasingly silent each day.  The more we explored the outer edges of the map, the more an ominous certainty began to form.
"Uh, maybe... "
"Just keep quiet. We're not sure yet."
"Yes... "
Two more days passed, bringing us to day 17.
We were back in the Old Rock Prairie.  We had circled the boundary line, keeping it to our left, but...
*Ziiizzt!* 
I drew the line to complete the incomplete circle on the map and let out a long sigh.  There was no point in trying to deny it any longer.
"Damn it."
We were trapped here.
