## The Closed Door (1)
"Hey, Baron Yandel…?"
As we climbed ashore, the knights, who had spotted me, froze, their expressions hardening. Well, from their perspective, it must have looked like a ghost had returned.  After all, Jerome had forcibly shoved me into this dangerous situation while I was unconscious.
"Are… are you alright…?" 
A knight approached, hesitant, sensing something amiss. He couldn't meet my gaze, however. Guilt, perhaps?
"Summon Count Saintred. I have something to tell him."
"Yes? Ah… yes! I'll deliver the message immediately!"
One of the knights, stationed near the trees, bolted off towards the Count.  Soon, Jerome Saintred appeared, flanked by a contingent of knights. He stared at me, scrutinizing my very essence, before finally speaking.
"I'll handle things here. Everyone, take a break."
Okay, safe for now, I guess? I maintained my impassive demeanor, conscious of my expressionless face.  It was crucial for this plan to succeed.  I had to make Jerome believe I was the chieftain.
“….”
“….”
Silence reigned, despite the opportunity for a peaceful conversation.  I broke the silence first.
"Don't worry. The ritual was a success." 
A tone Björn, son of the Barbarian warrior Yandel, would never use.  Jerome, reassured, finally spoke.
"Success? That's fortunate. Now, give me 'it,' as promised."
“….”
"Having second thoughts? Then put it out of your mind.  If you don't give it up, you'll never truly be able to live as you are—."
"I have no regrets.  However, I have something to tell you that I couldn't say back then."
Jerome urged me to explain, his expression expectant.
"The object can't be moved right now."
"What do you mean?"
"Exactly what it sounds like. When I woke up in this body, a dimensional marker was beside me.  And... the object was fused with it.  I've tried countless times to separate them, but I've failed."
Half of this story was true, surprisingly.  The object only detached when I opened the portal to escape, right?  It dawned on me then that I couldn't use a portal in this monstrous form.
Jerome, unaware of these facts, was furious.
"Damn it! Why are you telling me this now?"
"Everything has its priorities, don't you think?"
"Don't be ridiculous—!"
"What's the problem? You wanted it for the King anyway.  Bring me here and use it.  And while I couldn't detach it, perhaps you can."
Jerome shut his mouth, taken aback by my audacity.  It wasn't so much that he was suppressing his anger, but that he was calmly evaluating the situation…
"Personally."
Jerome finally spoke, his voice firm.
"I need to see this for myself."
"Very well. I will evacuate the village, taking all the warriors. So, after we leave, take your time—"
"No. You're not going anywhere until I've seen everything for myself."
…Yeah, I knew you'd say that.
"Suit yourself."
Now, it all depended on the chieftain.
***
The village of monsters, hidden beneath the trees. 
The exploration team, arriving at their destination, received an order that wasn't an assault or annihilation.
"Standby until further notice!"
An indefinite wait. 
But this simple order made the knights, priests, and mages in the exploration team swallow their saliva, their faces tense.  It was simple.  They weren't just waiting. They were waiting while facing off against hundreds of village warriors.
"Evoust, if those monsters move or act suspiciously, attack and kill them immediately."
"Yes sir."
"And while I'm gone, make sure you 'look after' Baron Yandel."
The tone he used for 'look after' suggested he'd briefed his second-in-command.  Knowing Jerome, he wouldn't have said much. Just told Evoust to watch me, to prevent me from approaching my companions or doing anything else.
"But are you truly alright alone, Sir?"
"I'm fine. No harm will come to me if you do your part here."
Jerome's actions were hardly rash.  He believed that the chieftain had possessed my body.  With the village monsters bound like this, there was no real threat within the village.
"Ahem…"
Evoust awkwardly cleared his throat as Jerome walked alone into the village, coming to stand beside me. I continued my thoughts.
'Okay, how will this play out?'
The chieftain had said that if he could just make Jerome Saintred come here to the cave alone, he'd handle the rest. 
He was so confident that I told him to go for it.  After all, even if he failed, it wasn't a huge loss for me.
Either the chieftain would overpower Jerome and take his body, or Jerome would retaliate and kill the chieftain.  Either way, it was all good for me.
Of course, if Jerome came back alive, my collusion with the chieftain would be exposed…
'But we were going to backstab each other anyway.'
It was a draw, you could say.  There would be bad blood, but since we were both at fault, it was possible to resolve it through negotiation.
'And if the chieftain wins, there's an advantage to that, too.'
So, I left the climax of the plan to the chieftain.  He wanted to do it, too.
The only thing I was worried about was them getting together and backstabbing me while I was gone…
'I'm freaking out. Neither the chieftain nor Jerome are trustworthy.'
The more I thought about it, the more pessimistic I got, so I stopped thinking about it.  I had a backup plan, after all.  Right now, the best course of action was to observe.
"Evoust, can I talk to my companions for a bit?"
I asked the second-in-command, but he firmly refused, without even a hint of possibility.
"I'm sorry. I'll strongly request it when the commander returns, so please wait until then."
"…Alright."
I was worried about my captured companions, but I quickly dismissed those worries.  His stubborn attitude made it clear that no amount of persuasion would work.
"…. I should ask Misha about the Stone of Resurrection."
It wasn't out of curiosity.  It was more for verification.
The Stone of Resurrection was 100% from Baekho.  I could guess what his objective was in giving it to Misha.
'Ugh… that guy… can I ever trust him?'
To be honest, I wasn't even betrayed anymore.  I just felt repulsed by his relentless persistence.
"Huu…"
Anyway, time flew by as I pondered, under the watchful eyes of the knights.  And then…
"The Count has returned!"
Jerome Saintred, who had ventured into the village alone, returned and stood before me.  I felt a sudden tension.
'Is it the chieftain, or is it him?'
The answer came quickly.  The commander of the exploration team extended his hand towards me.
"Baron Yandel, thank you.  Because of you, we were able to eliminate him."
So, he won.
***
I don't know what happened between them in private.  The only thing I knew was this.
'The chieftain won.'
The chieftain had managed to overpower Jerome Saintred and take his body.  In other words, the entire exploration team, composed of high-ranking royal talents, had fallen for a strange guy.  Now, we had control of this exploration team.
"Evoust, release all of Baron Yandel's companions."
"…Yes? But…"
"Don't worry. Everything I did to Baron Yandel was just a ruse to deceive the 'chieftain.'"
"…. Yes?"
My second-in-command seemed confused by my change in attitude, so I stepped forward to explain.
"The chieftain had a way to secretly observe everything that happened on the island.  To deceive him, I had to deceive everyone, including you, first."
"Yes? So…"
"It was all an act from the beginning.  Just a way to easily catch the chieftain.  We needed to catch that guy."
I stopped there, avoiding going into details.  It was too time-consuming, and a slip of the tongue could lead to trouble...
"Baron Yandel, thank you for your hard work.  It can't have been easy acting."
"Ha-ha! It was nothing!"
My second-in-command was still unconvinced, but when he saw us both laughing and joking, he stopped speaking.  What else could he say when we said it was all a show?  Besides, people tend to believe what's positive for them.
"W-well, it did seem a bit suspicious.  I followed your orders because I thought you must have had a reason… but… The commander seemed to treat Baron Yandel as just a pawn..."
If they all believed that it was all a cooperative effort between Jerome and me, there wouldn't be any trouble.
Was that it?  The exploration team members still harbored some doubts, but they didn't question what we said.
'The first hurdle is overcome.'
It was important to convince the exploration team of this excuse.  This was the only way for the chieftain, who would now live as Jerome Saintred, to avoid any disadvantages, and it would allow the next plan to proceed naturally.
'The problem is… not getting caught before that….'
This part wasn't a concern either.  You'll see just how thorough this guy is in the events that follow.
"Sir… The monsters are going wild!"
"They finally realized their leader is dead."
As the monsters, who were facing off against us, started yelling in Ancient Language, the chieftain gave his order without hesitation.
"All units, charge! Eliminate the monsters!"
An order against those he had treated like pawns just moments before.
"Nia Raphdonia…"
The exploration team, in full attack mode, launched a full-scale assault. The monsters were slaughtered, powerless to resist. They couldn't even fight back properly.
It wasn't because they'd lost their leader.
"What… what did you do to them? Why can't they even fight back?"
"It's nothing."
"….?"
"I just told them to fight a bit then die.  They're useless now, aren't they?"
…What a guy!  I felt a shiver down my spine, but I understood his actions.
'…They're intelligent, and can even communicate in Ancient Language, so this is the most effective way.'
Dead men tell no tales.  The problem was that I was the only one in the world who knew the chieftain's secret.  Still, I decided to always be on guard, but not think negatively all the time.  There was a good side to it, too.
"It's all over now…"
The chieftain, who had swallowed Jerome's body, spoke to me after the village was subdued.
"Baron Yandel played a major role in this battle.  So I'm going to give you a reward…"
"…"
"What do you want? Essence? Ores? Equipment? Anything you want, just say the word."
I had a way to legally suck the blood of the royal family.
