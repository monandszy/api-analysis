## Return (4)
A glass of iced soda, its refreshing effervescence amplified by the abundance of ice.  After swirling the glass to ensure optimal chill, I drained it in one go.  After all, ice melts and dilutes the flavor.
“Ah…,” I sighed with satisfaction.
Yes, this was it.  This taste, I had missed it so dearly.  This world was bearable, but the absence of carbonated drinks was a torment.  While I could find some semblance of fizz in beer, it lacked the crispness of its modern counterpart.
“Perhaps I should go back,” I mused, a faint flicker of a long-dormant desire to return igniting within me.  The taste of this soda was enough to rekindle a hope I thought had died.
I백호 needed to know this.  If he had taken the time to brew a batch of soda instead of concocting his so-called 'Revival Stone,' I would have seriously contemplated returning.
“Elder, please, just one more.”
Having finished the first glass, I received a refill.  This time, however, I savored every sip instead of chugging it down.
“You… seem truly happy,” the Elder observed.
Oh, how irritating.  People like us, even when joyous, are quick to sour at the slightest hint of a remark like that.
“Now, tell me. How did you meet her?”
“You mean the Witch?”
“Yes. I simply cannot comprehend it. No matter how I think about it, I can't imagine a scenario where you two would cross paths.”
Hmm.
“How can you be so sure, Elder?”
I challenged him, narrowing my eyes.  The Elder, caught off guard, shifted his gaze, his mouth sealed shut.
“….”
A chill ran down my spine.  What was this? Was he truly monitoring my every move? How?
As I pondered, the Elder smoothly changed the subject.
“For one, you didn't meet her on the first floor. And during that time, you were exceptionally busy, weren't you? You were juggling the tribe's affairs, the Mage Tower, and you even captured two floor bosses, if I recall correctly.”
It was true, I had been busy.  On top of an endless workload, I was also dealing with Count 알미너스's slanderous accusations.  But that didn't mean the Elder's words were entirely without merit.
“You've already finished. Give it to me. I'll pour you another.”
The Elder immediately snatched my empty glass and refilled it.  It wasn't appropriate to say, but he was quite consistent in his ways.  A master of shifting between roles as needed, perhaps?
“Elder, I cannot reveal anything for free. Even I need some reward for this information.”
I firmly drew a line, and the Elder, who had shed his mask once we were alone, bristled with irritation.
“Free? What do you mean? I even poured you soda!”
“Yes, I am grateful for that.”
“Well, if someone is truly grateful—”
He was overstepping his bounds.
“If soda is all it takes, then why do you have money and magic stones?  A single glass of soda should be enough.”
I mocked him outright, and the Elder's expression hardened.
“I always say this, but you have a knack for making people uncomfortable.”
His smile, once so warm, vanished, replaced by a stern frown that radiated a palpable sense of pressure.
But what was I supposed to do?  This wasn't the first time.  I had a grasp of this old man's character.
“Don't pretend to be angry. It won't work anyway.”
I brushed off his feigned anger with nonchalance, and the Elder reverted to his usual demeanor.
“Haha, you're not easy to deal with either. So, what is it you want from me?”
A wild horse cannot be tamed with a whip, only with a carrot.
“You must want something in return, else you wouldn't be doing this.”
Truth be told, I didn't have a specific request.  Or rather, I had too many questions and couldn't decide where to begin.  So, I needed to prioritize.
“Asking why you're doing all this is too broad.”
After much deliberation, I opted for a more specific question.
“Why are you shutting down the Ghostbusters?”
A question aimed at understanding the Elder's latest action.
“Hmm, should I just answer? There's no magic stone here to ensure truth.”
It sounded like he could create a new stone right then and there if I asked, but I declined.
“Just answer. Even with that, it doesn't guarantee 100% honesty.”
“You're saying you'll judge for yourself whether it's the truth.”
“Yes. So answer carefully. If you lie and get caught, you'll be the one losing.”
It might sound childish, but this threat was quite effective.  After all, this old man wanted to manipulate me like a puppet.  I needed to maintain a decent relationship with him.
“Hmm….”
But why was he staring at me with those creepy eyes instead of just answering?
“What is it?  Do you have something to say?”
“No.”
“No? You were about to say something just now.”
I glared at him, questioning his intentions.  The Elder finally relented and spoke in a begrudging tone.
“I was just… impressed.”
“…?”
“By your attitude towards trust.”
What nonsense was he spouting? 
I stared at him with a dumbfounded expression, and the Elder continued.
“If someone betrays you, they shall face punishment. That's what trust means to you.”
Isn't that true for everyone?  Would you just laugh it off if you were betrayed?
I swallowed my inner thoughts and listened intently.
“Just like laws prevent people from committing crimes easily, your trust is built upon the existence of a means to punish—.”
Ugh, I couldn't take it anymore.
Just hearing his words made it sound like I was some kind of paranoid patient with a serious trust issue, unable to believe anyone unless they were constantly under my control.
I asked bluntly.
“Elder, are you having some kind of mental breakdown?  No, how do you even interpret my words that way?”
“Hmm….”
“Think about what you've done first. What is there for me to trust you about?”
“So, you feel differently about your comrades?”
Of course I do.
…I wanted to answer that, but for some reason, I couldn't immediately reply.  The Elder's earlier words echoed in my mind.
“If someone betrays you, they shall face punishment.”
Punishment.
Could my actions towards 미샤 be considered a form of punishment?  
I didn't know, but this line of questioning was going nowhere.
“Enough. Just answer my question. Why are you closing this place?”
“If I answer, will you answer my question too?”
Without a moment's hesitation, I replied.
“If I find your answer worthwhile.”
Translation: I'm ready to run anytime.
***
It wasn't a definitive answer, but it was far from vague.  The Elder definitely understood the implications behind my response.  However…
“Good. Then listen and decide.”
Surprisingly, the Elder readily agreed to my terms without protest.
“As always, Elder, you're so straightforward!”
“…You really need to stop changing your attitude like that. You sound like a child someone is trying to appease.”
“It's just a feeling. Just a feeling.”
“….”
“So, what's your answer?”
I asked him with a charming smile, and the Elder sighed deeply before replying.
“The reason I'm shutting down the Ghostbusters is simple.  It’s no longer serving its intended purpose for the players.  Not in the way I envisioned, at least.”
“No longer serving its purpose? How so?”
“This place has become nothing more than a haven for the players.  A place to reminisce about home, share stories, and alleviate loneliness amongst those who share their predicament.”
“But why is that a bad thing?”
“That’s the problem, you see. When people become content with their current situation, they tend to settle down.”
“Ah…”
I think I understand what he meant.  
Even just looking at the freeboard, I could sense that kind of atmosphere.  Posts about real estate prices, marriage announcements, even kids being born were easy to find.
“The friends you met earlier are no different.  A few years ago, they would never have missed an opportunity like that.”
The Elder seemed to believe that the OX quiz ending so abruptly stemmed from the players' complacency.  
It wasn't entirely wrong.
“So, you're going to get rid of it?  Everyone will stop thinking about going back home if this place is still around?”
“That's basically it.”
That's basically it…
Clearly, there was more to the story that he wasn't telling.
“Well, what do you think?  Is this good enough?”
“No.  Unless there's some big secret hidden here, I find this information far too insignificant to trade for the Witch's intel.”
In other words, I was trying to bail on the deal.
Surprisingly, the Elder's expression remained placid.  He seemed to be implying that ending the conversation here wouldn't be a loss for him.  Was he trying to maintain control by pretending to be unfazed?
In the end, I was the one to break the silence.  
I couldn't leave without gaining something from this encounter.
“So, I was thinking…”
“….”
“Would you consider simply leaving the community alone?  Then I'll give you the Witch's information.”
I didn't actually want to protect the community.
I was just curious how the Elder would react to this offer.
“That’s impossible.”
So, a rejection.  It meant that shutting down the community was a higher priority for him than hearing about the Witch.
Then what was the real reason?  
It didn't seem like it was simply because the players were getting complacent.
“Then today's conversation ends here.”
“Yes.  It's not like you'd answer my questions anyway, even if I pressed further.”
“Haha, you really need to learn to trust people a little.”
“I trust the people I should trust.”
I replied with a vacant expression, signaling the end of the conversation.
“I have to go.  I have something else to take care of before the shutdown.  I'll see you around.”
“Yes.  Next time we meet, try telling me everything honestly, no matter what, whenever that may be.”
“That’s an odd request. I can tell you everything, even now.  If you're willing to believe me, that is.”
Oh, how blatantly he lied.
I chuckled, my tone dripping with sarcasm.  The Elder returned a smile that implied he had expected this.  And then…
“I don't know if you'll believe me or not, but I'll give you one piece of advice.”
“Advice?  Go ahead. I'll listen.”
“I백호.”
“I백호…?”
“Don't get too close to that guy.”
It was a random statement, leaving no room for questions.
“That's all the advice I have.  I'll see you later.”
With those words, the Elder left the roundtable.  As I watched him go, my mind slowly returned to the present, the potential implications of his statement swirling in my head.
“I백호, huh…”
Perhaps…
I wasn't sure, but it was possible.  Could this guy be the reason why the Elder was shutting down the community?  
Like burning down a straw hut to kill the fleas, the community's demise would sever my communication with I백호.
Of course, it was just my speculation, so it meant nothing in the end.
“Damn old man. He never tells me anything straight.”
I let out a sigh of frustration, my mutterings echoing hollowly in the room.
“….”
A strange silence fell over the room.  The empty chair and the roundtable, devoid of the jewel that was once a symbol of their gatherings.
‘This feels like a real failure.’
I wanted to get out of here and get to work, but my feet wouldn’t budge.  It was hard to believe it was really happening.  
The Deer Antler and the Crescent Moon had left on the first turn, followed by the Elder, who had gradually picked off the members one by one.
Thump.
I picked up the Lion Mask, which I had taken off while drinking soda, and tried it on.  This would be the last time I wore this mask, wouldn't it?  I've grown quite fond of it.
“Is this really the end…?”
It was hard to put into words, but there was a sense of emptiness.  I hadn’t imagined a happy, graduation-like atmosphere, but I had never considered an ending like this.
Maybe that’s why…
“I can't thank you.”
“Do you really find this fun?  You?”
The last words of those two kept replaying in my head.
However, I shook my head, shaking off those intrusive thoughts.
‘What am I even doing?  This wasn’t even a gathering for friendly socializing.’
I chuckled and removed the mask, placing it on the roundtable before scanning the empty surface.
“…Not fun.”
And so, the final gathering concluded.
***
Back in my room, after witnessing the end of the roundtable.
I lay on the bed for a moment, trying to regain my composure before sitting down at the computer and checking my messages.
‘I have one message… but…'
It wasn't from the GM, as I had expected.
[Sender: HS123]
HS123.
That meant it was from 현별.  
It made sense, I hadn't even gotten a chance to properly greet her earlier because of I백호.
I wonder what the message said.
Click, click.
I opened the message, revealing its contents.
“When we talked about revealing our identities, you drew the line first.  But I'm going to do things my way now.  I can't tell you much about my identity in a message because the admins might be secretly watching.  But…”
The main point was in the last line.
“See you outside.”
Outside, huh….
I guess I should get out of this Labyrinth first.
