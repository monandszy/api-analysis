## Chapter 695: The Return Scroll
The expression on Baekho’s face didn't reflect any significant worry. 
“Wow, this little shit's at it again. Does he really think we're fools?” 
He chuckled mockingly, glancing at the limp Briet. Then, Baekho delivered a powerful kick.
“See? One good kick and he’ll be back up—.”
*Thud!*
“Huh? What? Why isn't he getting up?”
Briet lay motionless, even after being struck by the kick.  Baekho's face hardened almost instantly.
“What the hell?” Baekho hurriedly crouched down, pretending to be surprised, and checked Briet's condition. Or rather, he slapped his face repeatedly.
“Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Wake up! Stop messing around and wake up! Hey! Wake up!”
“Stop it. He’s already dead.”
“No, this doesn’t make sense. He even drank a potion. Why would he suddenly die? Hey, Grandpa! Did you do something wrong? Did you accidentally kill him while opening the subspace?”
The Doom Grandpa, unexpectedly made responsible, slowly walked over and stabbed a needle into Briet's neck. Then...
“Poison.”
“Poison? Ah! Could it be because of the poison powder from before?”
“It’s a potent poison far surpassing that powder.  Although he appears fine on the surface, his organs have all dissolved.”
“So, he's really dead?”
“Indeed. There's no room for doubt—.” 
As Doom Grandpa was about to confirm, Baekho acted swiftly,  kicking Briet’s head with a *crack* and sending it flying like a soccer ball.  
*Thud. Roll, roll.*
Silence descended for a moment as we processed the sudden turn of events. Then, Baekho muttered,
“Ugh, why does nothing ever go my way?”
Baekho yawned nonchalantly, as if nothing had happened, and lumbered towards us.
“Grandpa! Tell me, why did this little shit die all of a sudden?”
“As I said, a potent poison—.”
“But that’s the thing, it doesn't make sense. We were hit with the poison powder, so why did he die from poison?”
“I don’t know everything in the world, you know.”
Doom Grandpa, annoyed, furrowed his brows, and Baekho sighed.
“Hmmm, maybe he took some kind of poison beforehand?”
“Ah, I’ve heard about this. People on secret missions always have poison pills hidden in their mouths.”
“If he chewed on that poison pill when everyone was distracted by the subspace, it could explain things.”
The explanation made sense, but there were still some dubious parts. But at this point, bringing it up would only lead to more awkwardness.
“Ha….”
Baekho seemed to be thinking about something else but didn’t say anything.
Perhaps he was hesitant to explicitly question Briet again, considering that he had already used the 'Misaligned Trust' to interrogate him before.
“Forget it. Let’s just continue sorting out the loot. Let us know immediately if you find anything suspicious.”
“Yes, I will.”
“If you get caught trying to steal from the loot in this situation, I’m going to lose my mind, so be careful.”
Baekho never forgot to give his comrades a final warning.
If I were in their shoes, I would be frustrated, but seeing them simply shake their heads instead of reacting strongly suggests they’ve grown accustomed to Baekho’s way.
“Okay, so we’re pretty much done here.”
We sorted out the loot together. Equipment, consumables, and materials.
As human beings, it was hard to resist looking at the loot, but everyone focused on something else this time. A collection of mysterious objects with unknown purposes.
“Let’s check each one. The wolf mask, the wolf medal.  Okay, next.  What do you think this is, this picture?”
“Well… It just seems like a piece of art.”
“I don’t see any hidden messages or anything written in magical ink.”
“Okay, then next.  What do you think this is?”
“This… Isn’t this a woman’s underwear?”
“I wasn’t the only one who thought that.”
“Ugh! What the hell is this!”
We used our collective intelligence to analyze the suspicious items one by one, but found nothing of significance.  Until we found a piece of parchment.
“Why is this categorized here?”
“Isn’t it just a magic scroll?”
Even a non-magical person like a regular human would be able to cast a spell with a scroll, simply by tearing it.  But why was this here?
“Who put this here?”
“It was me.”
The GM raised his hand timidly in response to Baekho’s question.
“Why did you put it here?”
The Doom Grandpa, after briefly glancing at the scroll, stepped forward and answered on the GM's behalf.
“Because it’s not a regular magic scroll.”
“…?”
“This scroll contains ancient magic.”
“What kind of ancient magic?”
“It seems to be a space-related spell, but I couldn’t figure out anything else. Do you know anything about it?”
Doom Grandpa nodded in response to the GM’s question.
“I do. This might be the lifeline we’ve been looking for.”
“Lifeline…? What are you talking about?  Spit it out.”
When Baekho pressed for an answer, Doom Grandpa stated the scroll's name.
“Return Scroll.”
“…?”
“That’s the name of this item.”
It was an item I had never seen or heard of before.
*The Return Scroll.*
I had never seen or heard of this scroll while playing *Dungeon and Stone.*  Perhaps due to its intuitive name, Doom Grandpa’s words “lifeline” immediately made sense.
“…So, can we use this to return to the city?”
“No one knows for sure. This scroll only has the effect of ‘returning’ to a designated location.”
“If it’s true, then it’s truly amazing. It allows for spatial transportation with just a single scroll, without a fixed coordinate magic circle or a magic converter.”
“It is indeed an ancient magic scroll. It’s said that during ancient times, there was an abundance of even more incredible magic.”
Although it wasn’t a scroll that instantly returned us to the city as we had expected, the group’s eyes still held a glimmer of hope. It couldn't be worse than our current situation.
“Using this scroll, we can at least escape this ruin, right?”
“Indeed. But we must also consider the worst-case scenario. If this scroll takes us to the 'Ash World', then we’re in trouble.”
“You’re saying we need to make a careful decision.”
As always, Doom Grandpa simply provided information, leaving the decision to us.  As a result, everyone’s eyes turned to me and Baekho.
They were hoping that our opinions wouldn't clash again, which would be a headache. But…
“I think we should try using it.  What about you, Baron?”
“I agree.”
For once, our thoughts aligned. We weren't naive enough to think it was safe just because it was called the Return Scroll, but at least we would need a crisis to overcome something.
We had grown tired of being stuck in this place for days.
“But we should prepare fully before tearing the scroll.”
“I agree.”
“….”
“Ahahaha, I agree too.”
After reaching an agreement, we examined the remaining unsorted items. However, we didn’t find anything special like the Return Scroll.  Therefore…
“There are a total of eight Return Scrolls….”
“That means we each have one, and we’ll have two left over.”
Since there were six of us, the remaining two scrolls were given to me and Baekho.  We also appropriately distributed the equipment and consumables we had acquired from Briet.
After that, everyone took some time to prepare themselves, aiming for optimal condition.
“Everyone ready? Then let’s tear them?”
As Baekho raised his scroll, the others nodded and followed suit.  And all of us, simultaneously, tore the scrolls.
***
*“The character used a [Return Scroll].”*
*“The character is moving to a designated location.”*
***
*Drip. Drip. Drip.*
The sound of dripping water reached my ears. I opened my eyes and quickly checked my surroundings.
“This is… the Crystal Cave?”
“No, it’s slightly different.”
The cave had a similar atmosphere to the first floor Crystal Cave.
“At least no one is missing.”
All of us had successfully teleported to the same location, and there were no monsters or enemies nearby. However…
“Quiet.”
A flickering red glow from a campfire could be seen in the passageway on the opposite side. *Whoosh!* Baekho gestured at me, and I naturally took the lead of the group.
We cautiously took steps forward, trying to avoid making any noise. *Thud. Thud.*  Well, it was impossible for this gigantic body with iron armor to remain silent no matter how carefully we moved. But anyway...
“….”
As we rounded the corner, we came face-to-face with an unidentified figure sitting by the campfire.  Despite the lack of noise from our presence, this person remained motionless, staring down at the flames.
“The fact that you’re here means… Briet must be dead, right?”
The person didn’t even look at us as he slowly continued speaking.
“Such a faithful friend… .”
“Forget it, who are you?”
Baekho asked, his voice alert and aggressive.  ‘That voice… it sounds familiar…?’
As a sense of déjà vu and a warning of danger rang in my head, the figure slowly lowered the hood that had been covering his face, revealing his visage.  "It’s been a while, everyone.”
Wrinkles etched on his face.  Pure white hair and beard.
The kind eyes contrasted with the intense gaze.  “….!”  
He was Auriel Gaviss, the creator of *Dungeon and Stone*.
Auriel Gaviss.  The mastermind behind this damned game, an enigmatic old man whose motives remained unclear.
The last time I saw him, aside from the dream where I returned to the modern world, was at the round table.  He had suddenly appeared there, declaring his intention to shut down the community, ‘Ghostbusters’…. He had left me with one meaningful piece of advice.
*[Baekho, don’t get too close to that friend.]*
It was ironic.  The person who received that advice was now traveling alongside Baekho, and I had encountered this old man during that journey.
“….”
“….”
While feeling a strange sense of déjà vu, I immediately analyzed what this old man had said.
‘He definitely said “everyone”, right?’
*It’s been a while, everyone*.  He even glanced at all of us while saying that.
As if he knew all of us.
‘Could it be that Lex Aureus and Jeina also have some connection with this old man?’
I was checking my surroundings, thinking about this, when he spoke again.
“You’ve all become rather quiet, haven’t you?”
The old man interrupted my thoughts and addressed us once more.  Baekho growled.
“Long time no see, old man. You were nowhere to be found when we were looking for you.”
His eyes were filled with an aggressive aura, as if he was ready to pounce, but Auriel Gaviss simply chuckled and casually dismissed his remark.
“Why would a relic like me have any reason to show up in front of you youngsters, who are now leading the times?”
“…You call yourself a relic?  Hey, old man.  Do you know what the common trait of all relics is?”
“Hmmm, what is it?”
Auriel Gaviss asked, feigning ignorance.  Baekho muttered in response.
“They’re all dead.”
Maybe he meant that if they were alive, they wouldn’t be relics anymore.  The exact intention was unclear, but one thing was for sure.
“So, if you want to become a relic, just tell me.”
Baekho’s animosity toward Auriel Gaviss was palpable.
“I’ll gladly lend a hand whenever you need it.”
This was one thing he genuinely meant.  Not a facade.
*Creak*.  Of course, from Baekho’s perspective, he couldn’t coexist with Auriel Gaviss.  ‘Auriel Gaviss’ was the one who dragged us to this wretched world.
All the resentment he accumulated while living in this world naturally converged upon this old man…
“Elder.”
Suddenly, the GM interjected, breaking the tense atmosphere.  He was also a veteran player who had been trapped in this world for over a decade, like Baekho, but the tone of his voice was completely different.
“It’s an honor to meet you again, Elder.”
His eyes and voice radiated respect and goodwill.  It was clear that he wasn’t simply kowtowing to power.
“I didn’t get a chance to properly greet you last time. Thank you for everything.”
“Haha, where’s the need for thanks?”
“On the contrary, you might be more hurt and upset with me, considering…  But I’m truly grateful.  It’s just that I returned what you had lent me.”
“Haha, indeed.  My eye for talent wasn’t wrong. I knew you would do great things.”
“…Thanks to you.  By the way, how do you know Baron?”
