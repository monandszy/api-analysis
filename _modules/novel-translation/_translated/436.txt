## The Rival (2)
Lee Baek-ho.
Twenty-three years old.
A fresh-faced young man with the features of a country boy, a newly discharged soldier with a buzz cut. He called me "hyung" (older brother).
"Me? It's been at least ten years," he'd said.
At least ten.
No, it had been four years since he'd said that, meaning he'd been a player in this city for at least fourteen years.
At first, I thought he was a strange fellow. But…
"You are already a part of this place," Hans A had said, meeting me in the Pit of Judgment. Through his words, I finally understood the venom and the unwavering resolve behind Baek-ho’s words.
"Hyung! Don’t talk like that! I'm going back! So you have to count it by real-world years!"
Baek-ho wasn't a strange fellow. He was simply desperate, more than anyone. That made him easier to read.
"Quick, unbind Ben. If you don't, you'll really die here."
His speech was flippant.
"Hey, you. Who do you think you are, starting a fire without my permission?"
He relied on his overwhelming strength and acted like a maniac.
"Wow, you really are a player?"
He might seem like someone who only acted according to his desires, but ultimately, he craved just one thing.
"I'm not forming any attachments in this world."
Escape this damn world and return to his own.
People with clear goals are often easy to deal with. However, I'd always avoided revealing myself to Baek-ho. But…
‘I don't need to hide anymore.’
He didn't know I was Lee Han-soo, but he did know I was an Evil Spirit. And most importantly…
"Wow, awesome…."
I had the confidence to protect myself in the worst-case scenario, thanks to the strength I'd built up over time.
"So… You really are Bjorn Yandell. Rhen Schweiz is Bjorn Yandell, so that means you were the one I met in Atlantis?"
After I revealed my identity, Baek-ho, who'd exclaimed in surprise several times, sighed in relief. 
"It's good… That I finally know. It's a relief."
That phrase bothered me.
"Relief…?"
"Ah… I think it’s better not to say it."
"It's something I need to hear and judge for myself."
My firm words furrowed Baek-ho's brows slightly.
"But, hyung."
"…"
"Why are you so aggressive toward me?"
His voice, more than anger, conveyed confusion. But without me needing to say anything, he understood.
"Ah… Now that I think about it, I was a bit harsh..."
He must have been remembering his encounter with Bjorn Yandell.
"I'm sorry, hyung. I didn't know it was you back then, so please understand."
Before I could decide whether to accept his apology, Baek-ho sighed again. 
"Hyung, you really… You should have just told me then. If you had, things wouldn’t have gotten so messed up."
Hmph.
This kid really knows how to make someone go crazy.
"So, are you saying that's my fault?"
"No, I didn't say that. It's my fault, though. Like you said, it's because of me that Bjorn Yandell is known to be an Evil Spirit."
A sudden surge of anger flared within me at the calm voice, but I suppressed it and focused on the conversation.
"Now that we know each other's names, I'll ask again. Why did you do that?"
"For my plan, I needed a symbolic figure. Like I said, if I'd known it was you, I would never have used that method."
I didn’t trust his words, even if he insisted. I knew enough about him now.
"Even if I really had died?"
Would he still have chosen not to use me?
***
"…"
My question was met with silence.
Was he the type who disliked lying? I thought about that, but it was too early to be sure. Maybe he just didn't tell obvious lies.
Baek-ho naturally changed the subject.
"You're not curious about how I figured out you were Bjorn Yandell? I thought you'd ask that right away."
The answer was simple.
I deemed something else more important. 
No matter how much I searched for reasons, the results of the past wouldn't change, even if it were possible to go back in time.
"Ah, of course, even if you'd asked, I wouldn't have answered."
What's this kid trying to do?
"But to be honest, I wasn't completely sure. So I decided to probe you this time."
I didn't need to hear how he’d probed me.
He’d acted as usual, despite his suspicions. He’d wait for me to mention "Misha" or "Bjorn Yandell" first.
‘Maybe he was acting so submissive in front of Hyun-byeol, too. To lower my guard.’
"Ah, but Hyun-byeol is really scary. How did you manage to date someone like that? Wow, it’s been ages since I lost a mental battle. I kept wanting to laugh, it was just so absurd."
Was that really what happened?
I didn't know, but it wasn't something to dwell on now.
"Anyway, that's enough about that."
I abruptly ended the topic and asked directly, 
"Why did you take Misha?"
"Of course, it's for conquering the Labyrinth."
I see. I had suspected it was for that reason, but hearing it confirmed brought an inexplicable sense of relief.
"You were also raising her for that, weren't you? A Freezing Dual-Sword Fighter is helpful in the latter stages of the ninth floor."
Naturally, there were still questions.
"You had other options, so why specifically Misha?"
"I liked her innocent love. I thought she’d never betray me if I promised to revive you with a Rejuvenation Stone."
"Is that all?"
"Well, there were other things… but they’re all trivial. To be honest, my decision was a bit impulsive. She was curious. To see if someone could remain unchanged even knowing you're an Evil Spirit."
It didn't seem like a lie.
He didn’t seem particularly interested in Misha, or rather, he treated her like an object.
"Ah, right! If you want her back, I’ll give her to you. I’ve raised her quite diligently for years. And I kinda feel bad toward Hyun-byeol, but…”
Right now, this guy was only interested in me.
"You and me, we're connected, right?"
He grinned, looking at me.
"I can handle that much. Can't I?"
Such overwhelming kindness.
It confirmed my suspicions.
This guy wasn’t treating me well simply because I was Korean.
There was something more to it. 
Otherwise, there was no way this guy, whose goal was to ‘return’, would give up Misha so easily. 
But…
‘It's better to pretend I don’t know for now.’
I didn't even try to probe him. 
My priority was securing Misha’s safe return… 
"So, the cat problem is solved. Let's talk about something else!"
"Something else?"
"I'm just curious about you, hyung. I wasn't as strong as you when I was your age. You even ate a Deep Sea Giant Essence recently. I’ve estimated based on the confirmed facts, and I think you must have at least four Rank 3 Essences…."
Baek-ho started asking me various questions, and I answered truthfully when necessary, filtering out what needed to be kept secret. 
The world works on give and take. 
Since I’d promised to give Misha back so readily, it was only fair to reciprocate his generosity.
However…
"So, what were you doing during those two and a half years?"
That question made me hesitate.
Should I tell this kid about my trip to the past twenty years ago?
I didn't need much time to decide.
‘He knows I’m Bjorn Yandell, so there’s no need to hide it. Maybe I can get some helpful information from him.’
Auril Gaviss was the common enemy of all players. 
It was important to share information and discuss ways to counter him. Therefore…
"Fragment of the Record Stone…? I’ve heard of it, but I never thought it was real."
Being sucked into the past at Parune Island…
And…
"You met Auril Gaviss…?"
I told him about my time in the past community, focusing on my journey there. He wasn’t going to be curious about saving Amelia, anyway.
"Oh, now that I think about it, that community was actually made by that guy."
"Yeah, I know. I heard it from that old guy, Ruingenesis… Wait a minute…  That old man said that Auril Gaviss brought in a weird guy before the community blew up… Could that have been you?"
"Probably."
"Wow… You’re like a main character. Tell me more. So what happened?"
"Auril Gaviss was really interested in the fact that I was a player from the future."
I explained my conversation with Auril Gaviss, leaving out the fact that I'd cleared the original mode. 
Surprisingly, Baek-ho already knew most of the information. He had a Ruin Scholar as one of his current companions.
It was why I had brought up the past in the first place. I was hoping to gain information on that topic.
"I also know the Ground Witch is alive. I don't know where, though."
"That old man said that the Ground Witch is at a place where everyone’s desires converge. Any idea where that could be?"
"Huh? You really got that answer? It’s easy. Besides the Labyrinth’s end, there’s another place."
"But there wasn’t a final boss in the game."
"That was just the tutorial, hyung. You’ve been around for a while now. You know this place is different from the game. Maybe the Ground Witch will appear as the final boss. Hmmm, how should I prepare?"
The conversation with Baek-ho was informative, not just about the Ground Witch.
It was like I’d shared information and received even more in return.
"Kagureas, you mean the Barbarian who collected three Creation Relics?"
Well, there were two during my time… 
No, more than that.
"That guy was a Barbarian…?"
"Didn't you know? He’s kinda connected to you. Small Balkan… They called you that, right?"
…What?
"You're telling me…."
"Yeah. Kagureas is Balkan. Or rather, it's highly likely considering the circumstances. The 2nd of April, 136 years after the Great Catastrophe. All the Creation Relics disappeared shortly after Balkan died at the age of 55, and they all returned to the lost races."
It was a shocking story.
I never thought the legendary senior who gave me my nickname would be an Evil Spirit.
"You know about the portal in the Royal Palace's underground, too?"
"I've been investigating it, but I haven't found much. Just that it's an exit, not an entrance."
"Exit?"
"It's not like you can go through the portal to somewhere else. It’s the opposite. If you go through a portal somewhere, it will take you to the portal in the Royal Palace’s underground."
Hmmm, I see…
It’s a suspicious story.
Anyway, we talked like allies for the first time in ages, which led to that question.
"Auril Gaviss, do you feel any remorse for the countless ‘Evil Spirits’ who were dragged to this place and died because of your greed?"
It was the final question of our Truth Game.
Baek-ho burst into laughter at the question.
"Pfft! Hahahaha! You really asked that old man?"
"Why are you laughing?"
"Just because, it’s a question that’s very you… hyung. You’re still pretty naive, though."
What? Me, naive?
I was shocked even as I listened, but Baek-ho seemed to genuinely think so.
"So what did he say? What did the old man say?"
I recounted Auril Gaviss’s response, verbatim.
"Of course, I’m not at peace with myself. It’s sad, of course. I do feel a sense of responsibility. I suppose I'll live with this guilt and atone for it for the rest of my life."
He said it while looking me straight in the eye, and the gem on his ring glowed red.
"Hmmm…"
I’d thought Baek-ho would join me in cursing the old man as a psychopath, but he had a strange expression.
"That's ambiguous, hyung."
"Ambiguous?"
"He was talking for a long time. On purpose. He was exaggerating a lot, too."
"Huh?"
"It’s a typical pattern when you hide lies within truth. And he wasn’t allowed to answer with anything besides yes or no, was he?"
Baek-ho was suspecting Auril Gaviss’s intentions.
But thinking about it, it wasn’t entirely unfounded.
"Hmmm, but why did he do that? Just a coincidence? What do you think, hyung?"
"Well… Who knows what’s going on in that old man’s head?"
"That’s… true."
We stopped there, no longer discussing Auril Gaviss’s response. 
Baek-ho seemed more interested in something else.
"Hyung…"
"Tell me. Don't make me anxious like that."
"Ah… but this might be a bit rude."
"Go on, I told you to."
"Okay?"
He asked me cautiously, 
"What’s your goal, hyung?"
It wasn't an unexpected question. 
But I asked back in surprise. 
"Goal?"
"Do you want to go back to Earth or not?"
I see. That’s what he was curious about.
"Back at the Nohm Tree, you said you weren't sure."
That’s right.
He’d asked me if it was because of the Red Cat tribe, and when I’d remained silent, he’d said that it felt like he was looking at his old self, warning me not to expect too much from NPCs.
‘…He probably didn’t place much value on ‘Bjorn Yandell’ then, because he dismissed me so readily.’
"Still not sure?"
"Well…"
"Then think it through carefully now. It’s been ages since your goal was just to survive."
Baek-ho’s intention was obvious, but I pretended to contemplate. However, it was something I’d been thinking about a lot lately, so…
"Goal…"
I’d just planned to pretend, but all sorts of thoughts began swirling in my mind.
What was my goal?
"If you’re having trouble, think of it like this. There’s a button here. If you press it, you’ll immediately go back to your original world."
Baek-ho’s advice was more helpful than I’d anticipated. Even if I couldn’t know what my future self would decide…
"So, what are you going to do?"
At least I could know my current state.
"…"
If such a button existed, I would have hesitated for a long time before pressing it. 
And in my head, I’d be thinking constantly.
What’s waiting for me at home?
So many things came to mind.
"…"
Hamburgers, cola, games.
Fun media and the convenience of countless modern devices.
No need to kill, no daily bloodshed, no pain or suffering.
I’d worry about life, not survival.
Yes, that's the kind of peaceful life I desire beyond this world.
But…
"…"
This world within this game is a terrible place, and that hasn’t changed, but…
‘I’d probably… not press it.’
I wouldn't press the button.
Because that’s not what I want now.
"You seem to have made up your mind about that, hyung?"
"Yes."
I’d reached a conclusion.
My goal is to survive.
In this place, where every step is taken on thin ice, surrounded by threats.
Together, with me, and with all the people I’ve met here.
That’s my honest desire.
Therefore…
"Can you tell me? What are you going to do?"
I met his gaze and answered,
"I’m going to press the button."
I decided to play along with him for now, without revealing my true thoughts.
It was obvious.
What kind of answer he was waiting for.
"…"
Baek-ho stared at me, silent after hearing my response.
A heavy silence ensued.
"Tsk."
It was a click of Baek-ho’s tongue that finally broke the silence.
"Come on, that’s so rude. Like you’re treating me like I’m a retard who can’t use skills here."
The guy, who always laughed playfully and spoke flippantly, stared at me.
"You’re lying while looking me in the eye."
His eyes were cold, a look I’d never seen before.
