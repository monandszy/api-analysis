##  651화 Barbarian Business (4) 
After receiving the comprehensive evaluation, I ultimately decided to seek assistance from the Count Goldbeard family.  It seemed logical, considering I was participating in the competition as the representative of Melbes.  There was no reason to rely solely on the Barbarians for this challenge.  The construction work, after securing the contract, would involve the combined efforts of all Melbes’ architectural businesses.
“The real problem is that old man’s pride…”, I mused.  The chairman’s unilateral decision had led to Baron Jandel’s family being named Melbes’ official representative.  This prompted anxieties about potential conflicts, but thankfully, Count Goldbeard promptly sent expert architects the same day I requested their help.  He was a nobleman, prioritizing practical benefits over pride.  Even if Baron Jandel’s family was the main force, the subsidiary trickle-down effects would benefit everyone.
“Hahaha! What do you think? This is the house we built!”
“Not bad… surprisingly.”
The dispatched architects initially looked skeptical, wondering how barbarians could even build anything. But they were soon impressed by the speed and quality of the work.
“Their skills might be rudimentary, but they are all explorers and strong-boned. Their strength in labor is undeniable.”
“If they handle the simple tasks requiring no skill or time-consuming procedures…”
“Our workload will definitely decrease drastically!”
The dispatched architects immediately began to assign roles.  Barbarians for manual labor, and Dwarves for tasks requiring architectural knowledge and craftsmanship.  As the chieftain, I couldn't help but feel a sense of regret that the warriors couldn't learn from the masters.  But, realistically, this was the most efficient approach.  Winning the competition was the immediate priority.
“Their work pace is quick, but they rely too heavily on brute strength.”
“A few days might be okay, but they won’t be able to sustain this pace for long.”
“They need training.”
The architects identified the primary issue and quickly initiated training to address it.
“Watch closely. When lifting the rebar, grip it firmly at this point, utilize your back muscles here… like this!”
“Oh…”
“When setting it down, do it at this angle, starting with this part.  See? It’s smooth even though you barely exerted any effort.”
“Wow…”
“When lifting the pillars, it’s always better to have two people, but if you have to do it alone, follow this posture.”
“Ooooh……”
The Dwarves, sharing their expertise from years of construction experience, and the Barbarians, eager to learn, were quite a sight.  Their learning pace wasn't bad, especially when it came to physical tasks.  Their natural aptitude for utilizing their bodies was unmatched.
“Not there, here.  Use your strength here.”
“Ah! So this is how it’s done?”
“…Yes! That’s how you do it…”
After establishing a training curriculum, we also discussed and finalized our work methods.  The final decision was to have a Dwarf architect act as a squad leader, overseeing a team of ten Barbarians. 
“One day, our Barbarians will be able to do it all themselves,” I thought.  It’s true for every profession.  You start with the menial tasks, gradually acquiring skills.  Eventually, you become a master.
“Tomorrow, I’ll request more architects from the Count. We can't handle this many people on our own.”
“Okay, thanks.”
“Then, could you tell me more about this competition the Prime Minister is hosting? We need to prepare accordingly.”
I explained how the competition would be held and its format.  I entrusted the preparation to the Dwarves, confident in their expertise.
“…I appreciate the trust, but wouldn’t it be better if we handle such an important task ourselves?”
“Because it’s important, I’m entrusting it to you.  You are the best experts in this field.”
“…You’re quite different from what I heard.  We’ll do our best to live up to your expectations.”
“I believe in you.”
On the surface, it seemed like I’d delegated all my responsibilities to the Dwarves, but it was more accurate to say I’d lightened my workload.  There were countless other things I had to take care of.
“Shavin, I’ll be heading back to the city.”
Ugh… when will I finish all this?
***
Lapdonia is a barbaric city that disregards human life, yet surprisingly modern in certain aspects.  There are banks, though they don’t offer loans.  Beneath the city, there’s a massive underground water system.  Magic being real, there are everyday items that defy science, which often surprises me.  But let’s not get into that now. 
Lapdonia, with its powerful government, requires a series of preparations before you can start a business. You can’t just buy land, build a building, and start selling things. It’s especially true in my case, with the complexity of my venture.
“Thankfully, it was approved this time.” 
Despite two rejections, my business registration application was finally approved today, thanks to Shavin Emuer’s assistance.  It was unusual for a titled nobleman with a clear background to face such hurdles, but it couldn’t be helped.
“Congratulations on the establishment of the Jandel Trading Company.  Once again, the maximum number of employees you can register is 10,000…”
It was almost unheard of for a business to begin with such a large scale from the outset. There were many things to review and countless documents to submit.  However, starting small was also impossible.  To utilize the Barbarians, they needed to be registered as employees first. 
The Dwarves already had their own companies, so we could outsource to them, but our Barbarians have never had anything like that.  Not even in their long history.
“The first Barbarian company…”, I pondered.  By chance, I was making history again.  But, I’ll get to that later.
After registering the warriors as employees over a few days, I started taking care of the people from Bipron. It would be a waste to let such a valuable workforce go to waste.  I was already footing the bill for their taxes, food, and lodging.
“Shavin, start teaching all the young men construction work today.”
“What? We’re already doing that.”
“…Really?”
“It’s a rare opportunity. I’ve told them to carefully watch the Dwarf architects and learn. If they can eventually take over those roles, that would be ideal.”
“Then what about the women?”
“The women are already working behind the scenes. They made all the food distributed yesterday.”
I was speechless.  She was already doing what I was about to tell her to do.
“Oh, right.  Since they got an education there, most of the children can read. When we have more time, we should properly educate them and assign them to office work.”
“…That’s… right?”
I suddenly remembered something the chairman had said to me previously.
[I can’t understand it.  Is it mere luck that these talents gathered around Baron Jandel, or is it because they are with Baron Jandel that they shine?]
To be honest, I didn’t feel much at the time.  After all, I was the one who devised the “lease” system. 
But now, I’m genuinely reflecting on those words.  What about Shavin?  Is she the former or the latter? 
I pondered, but the conclusion was that it didn’t matter.  Meeting Shavin, with her overflowing abilities, was my luck.  And it was I who gave her responsibility, allowing her to do anything, freeing her from limitations. 
“Uh… are you angry?” 
Shavin asked me a random question while I was lost in my thoughts.
“What? What are you talking about?”
“No, you looked a bit stiff, so I just thought…”
“Don’t worry.  There’s absolutely nothing like that.  I was just thinking about how fortunate I was to bring you along.”
“…That’s reassuring.”
Shavin, who looked awkward at my honest words, spoke hesitantly with a shy look that was unlike her usual self.
“I think I made the right decision, too…”
“…Huh?”
“I may be busy, but I’m glad I quit my previous job and followed you, Jandel. There… there are so many good people here.” 
Oh, so her look was indeed like a young girl’s.
“Are you talking about someone like Rotmiller?”
I asked, chuckling, and Shavin was startled. Her eyes widened in surprise.
“Whaaaat? How did you know?!”
“I didn’t.  Until just now.”
“……!”
Shavin covered her mouth in embarrassment.  After a long silence, she said.
“You… have to keep it a secret, right… If you don’t, I’ll quit.  Administrative work, Chief of Staff… everything.”  
She threw me a threat more terrifying than any other.
“O, of course. I’ll keep it a secret, don’t worry.”
“That’s good… I’m relieved.”
“But why should we keep it a secret? I think Rotmiller is also interested in you.”
“Really? Did Rotmiller say he was interested in me?”
“He didn’t say it. But I can feel it! I just have this feeling!”
“……What are you doing, teasing me like this?”
It wasn’t just a subtle current.  Rotmiller might be clueless, but Shavin was already in the stage of infatuation.
‘This is a new side of her.’
I was a bit taken aback by this unfamiliar side of her.  Then, I heard a knock on the door.  Shavin quickly fixed her hair.
“Why are you doing that?”
“It’s Rotmiller at the door!”
“…Huh?”
“…..Would you like him to come in?”
After clearing her throat, Shavin gave her permission in a carefully crafted tone. The door creaked open, and Rotmiller walked in.
“Jandel? You’re here, too?”
“Oh, I just came for a bit of work.  I’m just about to leave now.”
“It’s rare for us to be together. We should have a chat…”, Rotmiller insisted.
“I’m really busy. We’ll talk later!”
I practically fled the office.
‘…They’ll be fine on their own.’
No matter how I think about it, I’m not in the position to interfere with other people’s love lives.

Time always passes quickly.  Doesn’t it?  Whether I was busy or carefree, looking back, it always felt like it flew by in an instant.  This time was no different.
‘Why am I busier here than in the Labyrinth…’, I thought.  The chairman, who had become a real estate agent, introduced me to a nobleman.  I was summoned by Count Alminus for some business adjustments.  I investigated what preparations other families were making for the competition hosted by the Marquis. If we won the bid, I had to decide on the profit sharing with Count Goldbeard’s family and the other collaborating families.
“Hey, you awake?”
“Hurry up and get ready.  We’re going to be late.”
The busy days went on, and before I knew it, it was already morning.  The day itself.
“Ah! Today’s the day, isn’t it?”
“Ooooh! This is the day we show the world our warriors’ innate superiority!”
I got ready and headed to the designated location, and saw my warriors already gathered in the empty lot, shovels in hand.  90 Barbarians and 10 Dwarves.  100 elite warriors, carefully selected from among our warriors, as per the competition rules.
‘Such strong, valiant figures.’
I didn’t need to say much, as I could see the fire in each of their eyes.
“What are you all standing around for? Get your tools.”
This was a line I’ve always wanted to say.
