The Guide (Part 1)
Sven Parab emerged from the wardrobe and moved towards the window.  His head throbbed, the heat a physical manifestation of the overwhelming stress. His thoughts felt unmoored, as if a secondary personality within him were seizing control.  Thump, thump, thump, thump. His heart hammered a frantic rhythm, yet he hesitated no longer, leaping from the window.  Then…
Whoosh!
He attacked the dark mage, caught unaware in the rear, an instinctive action born not of reason, but of primal survival. Only after severing the mage's neck did reflection dawn.
Swoosh-
Eliminating such a dangerous variable so easily… the rest shouldn't be difficult, he thought.  This assessment proved correct.
“…Who are you?!”
“Kill…!!”
Only after the dark mage's head rolled, did the Noir Arc soldiers, initially surprised by the ambush, charge. Astonishingly, some recognized him.
“Sven Parab…!”
Though his name wasn't exactly famous…
“Yandel's comrade…!”
His association with such a renowned individual explained the recognition.
“Damn you!  So you had accomplices!”
His identity was revealed instantly, but he remained unfazed, concentrating solely on the dance of his blade.
Whoooooosh!
Swoosh!
With each sweep of his sword, limbs and heads flew, a battle of absolute dominance.
Swoosh!
When the brief, intense fight ended, and he regained his senses, the Noir Arc soldiers were gone.
Sven Parab lowered his gaze.  The white greatsword, newly acquired after relinquishing his position as a paladin and leaving the Reatras Church, was stained crimson.
He shifted his gaze sideways, taking in the scattered corpses, their warmth fading, life extinguished.
“…Mr. Parab?”
A sudden question arose in Sven Parab's mind. He couldn't judge the dark mage's skill, but the Noir Arc soldiers had been pathetically weak.  That's why they fell so easily to someone like him.  Yet…
'Why do these people…'
Why were they so eager to torment those weaker than themselves?
“Mr. Parab…!”
Hearing Marone's terrified voice, he snapped back to reality.  Thump, thump, thump, thump…  As his intense excitement subsided, his usually reliable intuition reasserted itself.
Thump!
This place is dangerous.  Staying here could mean death.
Sven Parab frantically looked back at the window from which he had jumped.  But…
“No, not again…”
He knew instinctively:  even if he returned to the wardrobe, it was no longer safe. The place he'd considered the only safe haven in this city was gone.
“Mr. Parab…?”
There was no time for despair.  They'd already reported to their superiors before he'd killed them.  Reinforcements would arrive immediately upon confirmation of their silence. So, what should he do?  Lacking his usual intuitive guidance, his decision was swift.
“…We must move immediately.”
He had to escape this place.  As quickly as possible.
The street, heavy with a chilling aura, blurred past him as he ran.
Thud-thud-thud!
He carried three people: a mage, and a mother with a child nestled in her arms.
“…Where are you going? That's the direction of the fire.”
“That's precisely where we’re going.”
His destination, the already half-consumed eastern sector of District 7, was simple. Fire was less frightening than people. Fewer soldiers would be present in the rapidly spreading blaze—especially since the fire was clearly beyond control.  Hiding nearby was the best option; if things went wrong, leaping into the flames and using magic and divine power to survive was the next best. So…
Thump, thump!
Ignoring the intuition screaming that this was equally dangerous, he pressed on.
Thud-thud-thud!
Each step felt like walking on thin ice. Carrying three people made it a precarious endeavor. The mother was larger than average, rendering his arms useless.  Discovery by the enemy in this state would be catastrophic.
“I’m sorry.”
A voice of apology drifted from behind him. It was Lily Marone.
“For what?”
“…I was angry, not knowing what kind of person you were.”
Her words, laced with guilt, struck a chord in Sven Parab’s chest.
“…You don’t need to apologize.  You weren’t wrong.”
“No, I was wrong.”
“…?”
“You saved us.  My statement is already false.”
…Was it? It felt a little forced, but he didn't correct her.  It was a pointless discussion in the present circumstances, and he somehow felt a lessening of regret—regret for choosing to leave the wardrobe.
“So… you’re heading to the burning eastern district?”
This time, it was the mother speaking. Was it the extraordinary circumstances? Her tone was soft, refined, and yet possessed a certain strength.
“I didn’t have the chance to properly greet you earlier.  We are truly grateful for saving us and our child…”
Her words made Sven Parab even more uncomfortable.
“…That wasn’t my intention.”
Until moments ago, he'd been internally debating whether to abandon the mother and child if things turned critical. It was a pragmatic worry, with no clear answer.  Yet, even while agonizing over the question, he knew: abandoning them and saving only Lily Marone would be the right choice.
“But gratitude is still gratitude.”
“….”
“Anyway… that’s not what I wanted to say… if you’re heading to the east, perhaps the Reatras Church Eastern Branch?”
An unexpected name.
“The Reatras Church…?
“Yes. My husband is an explorer.  With the world so dangerous, he often spoke of escape routes depending on the situation.”
“…But given the flames, the Eastern Branch is likely already engulfed.”
“No, that’s why we should go there. My husband said the 7th District Eastern Branch has a divine protection spell? It covers the entire building.”
He wondered if she’d misunderstood. He hadn’t heard of this as a former paladin of the Reatras Church.  But…
“What rank explorer is your husband?”
“…Rank 3.”
That increased his confidence. A Rank 3 explorer wouldn't provide inaccurate information about his wife’s refuge.  And, unlike administrators, paladins don't always know the status of every branch. A husband’s information, gathered out of worry for his wife, would be more reliable.
‘A fire-resistant building…’
If true, it would be the ideal refuge in this situation.
“The question is whether we can reach it safely… is it possible? I heard Yandel-san had something that protected him even in the flames.”
Ah, the Orb of Fire.  It was indeed well-known.
“If Miss Marone and I combine our strengths, the three of us… no, four, including the child, could likely reach it.”
Provided they didn't encounter more enemies.  Sven Parab left that unspoken.
“Oh… then that’s fortunate. We’re truly lucky to meet people like you…”
“Yes… but why were you hiding there, Madam? Evacuation from District 7 ended long ago… did you not evacuate then?”
The mother’s story was tragic.
“No, we did. But… other districts were overcrowded, so we had to settle on the outskirts.  We were so close to the front lines, we heard fighting and killing every day.”
“….”
“Then… the Royal Army was pushed back, and the Noir Arc forces advanced.”
The Noir Arc army, which had surged forward like a tide, retreated, kidnapping refugees indiscriminately.  According to fellow captives, they were being used as human shields, though this wasn’t confirmed.  Before she could be used as a human shield, she escaped.
“A giant fireball fell from the sky.”
A counterattack by the hard-hit Royal Army.  Their attack seemed to disregard the safety of their captives. She survived by escaping the chaos.
“There are probably many others hiding in District 7 like me. Thousands were taken captive then…”
“Such a story…”
The reality of war's tragedy hit him hard.  While running, Parab couldn’t help but wonder: what happened to her husband?  He left the question unanswered.  It was more important to focus on running than satisfying curiosity; some facts are self-evident. In the heart of a war zone where anyone could die, what reason would a Rank 3 explorer have to leave his wife and child alone?  So, Sven Parab didn't ask.
But the military mage, Lily Marone, was different.
“By any chance… what happened to your husband?”
A careful question.  Unexpectedly, the mother’s response was unemotional.
“I don’t know. When it happened, he was conscripted due to the mobilization order.  I just hope he’s safe…”
Marone offered comfort in response to her heartfelt whisper.
“Your husband will certainly be safe. He’ll be frantically searching for you right now!”
Her words were warm, yet the mother’s response was lukewarm.
“I don’t know… I just wish he’d stay put somewhere safe…”
“…?”
Lily Marone tilted her head in surprise at the unexpected answer. The mother, looking embarrassed, twitched her black-furred ears.
“My husband… isn’t good with directions… I worry he might go to a dangerous place looking for me…”
