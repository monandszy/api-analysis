##  The Audience (1)
The sixth subterranean level of the royal prison, accessible only through a teleportation magic circle. And…
"She's young," a young woman's voice echoed, seemingly trapped within the structure.
I looked at the position of the handprint on the wall, realizing it was remarkably low. A ten-year-old child could easily reach it.
"Wait, a second..."
A bolt of lightning struck my mind, like a philosopher slumped in a bathtub.
"The Ground Witch…?"
The Ground Witch. The main villain responsible for plunging this world into ruin, the source of the bizarre city called Laphdonia.
Yet, connecting a mysterious girl trapped in a box to the witch wasn’t entirely unreasonable. After all, this was the ‘underground of the royal palace.’ 
Considering the history of the royal family and the secrets they held, it wasn’t impossible for it to be not the witch, but the witch’s grandfather, hidden in this place.
Furthermore, and most importantly…
— Was the Ground Witch truly dead?
When I posed this question to Gaviss, he had answered decisively,
— She lives.
The Ground Witch lives.
It could be a hallucination, but I had encountered several girls claiming to be 'Alice Groundia' within the labyrinth. 
So, I presumed the witch was hiding somewhere in the labyrinth. 
Well, that wasn't the issue right now.
Bang, bang, bang!
I knocked on the wall with my massive fist, hoping for a response.
"Who are you in there? Speak up. Are you really trapped?  Say something! Didn't you ask for help?"
But there was no answer.
I even placed my hand on the wall, wondering if the voice was simply unable to reach me, but there was no response. The handprint that had been left on the wall from the inside had vanished without a trace.
"Miss Raven, is anyone in there?"
"Um… well…"
I hesitated for a moment before directly asking Raven.
"Raven, can you confirm if anyone is inside?"
"Hmm… I doubt it."
“…You haven't even tried?"
"Why bother? Judging by the magical energy, the portal inside this box is likely the same size as the cubic structure."
"…"
"Simply put, it's physically impossible for a living being to be inside! Unless they're sitting in the corner, they would have been sucked into the portal long ago!"
Oh, so that's how it is.
Raven's logical explanation made me momentarily question whether I had heard a hallucination, but that doubt didn't last long.
After all, this is a fantasy world, not the modern world.
There’s magic, superpowers, divine power, and even ghostly figures who can be subdued using those powers. It’s a world of supernatural phenomena that can't be refuted by anything like a Cartesian coordinate system.
"...So, what do we do? I can activate the magic circle any time now."
Raven's words made me ponder for a moment. 
What should I do? 
Should I investigate this box further?
"Yandel, you always tell us..."
"…"
"To prioritize. Is your curiosity more important, or is something else?"
Her words stunned me into silence.
'Curiosity…'
It wasn't entirely wrong, but it wasn't just ‘curiosity.’
The moment I heard the voice from the box, I felt something destined, something I couldn't explain. It felt as if ‘someone’ inside the box was calling me here.
"Raven, what are the odds of running through the corridor on the fifth floor and accidentally falling through the floor?"
"It would be extremely low. Unless, of course, 'Thunder' struck twice in a row, causing the dungeon to collapse."
Oh, how sarcastic.
You know exactly what I'm asking.
Swoosh.
I slowly looked up at the ceiling. 
There used to be a hole right above where we fell.
Everything else was intact, but for some reason, there was a hole only in the area where we were running. 
What’s even stranger, the hole had been restored within minutes.
And since then, not a single pebble has fallen, and the ground feels stable like a scientific bed.
"I understand what you're trying to say, Yandel. I have no desire to stop you, whatever you plan to do. But don't you think we should hurry?"
Raven’s urging led me to ask one last question.
"This is… a two-way magic circle, right?"
"Yes. I don't know where this magic circle will take us, but there will definitely be an identical one there. I suppose we can come back if we want to."
Yes, that’s how it is…
Thanks to that, I could easily finish my thoughts.
"Activate the magic circle."
There’s no doubt that there is a great secret hidden in this place.
But now is not the time to investigate.
For now, I’m content with discovering this path. I will return with every preparation made for a thorough investigation.
As Raven said, 
Every task has its priority.
This investigation is far less important than ensuring the safety of my comrades and myself in this situation.
Therefore…
"Shall I?"
I nodded in response to Raven's final confirmation.
After a moment, the magic circle activated.
Flash-!
A blinding flash of light filled my vision.
Gradually, the light faded, restoring my sight.
"This is..."
White walls, a white ceiling.
An intensely bright light, as if the entire room was lit by fluorescent lamps.
Raven, with a look of unease, pointed at one of the walls.
Then…
"Why is only this wall made of metal?"
"…"
"Huh? Look, there are tiny gaps in the metal. It seems like it opens sideways…"
"…"
"Yandel? Yandel? Can you hear me?"
"…I can hear you."
My senses haven't malfunctioned. I just feel a little dazed.
Thump, thump.
I finally regained my senses and walked towards the wall, which I could only assume was a door.
Raven muttered to herself, throwing out various speculations about ‘it’.
"Do we need something magical? But I can't feel any magical energy…"
Magical elements, magical energy, and so on.
When faced with a ‘door’ without a handle, a magician would immediately think of the most likely scenario.
Usually, the magician's deductions are the most accurate.
But…
"Get out of the way."
“…Yes? Oh, if you're trying to force it open—."
"I'm not doing that, so don't worry."
Standing in front of ‘it’, I slowly reached out my hand.
I still have no clue why ‘this’ is in this world.
But I know how to use ‘this’.
Click.
I extended my index finger, pressing the button.
And soon after.
Ding-!
A crisp sound, discordant with the world.
Rattle.
The elevator door opened.
*
Raven didn't ponder the principles behind this ‘mechanical device’. She was only amazed by two things:
Its laughably simple security system—pushing a button opens the door.
And the fact that no magical energy was involved.
Apart from that, she didn't really react.
"Ah, now that I look at it, it's a device similar to a magic elevator. We have something similar in our Magic Tower."
Despite her words, I was certain.
This ‘mechanical device’ is not powered by magic.
Raven still seems to believe there are microscopic circuits involved, but…
‘No way.’
I have ridden a magic elevator several times, even outside the Magic Tower.
But it was completely different from the one I’m riding now.
It lacked stability, barely better than a cage, and operated by magically moving the attached pulley.
But what about this?
"…"
"Yandel?"
Whether it’s powered by electricity or magic, I can’t tell just by looking at it.
Well, can you even tell by looking at it?
‘Damn it, why is this here?’
The design itself is different.
Even if it were installed in a luxurious hotel that costs millions per night, it wouldn’t feel out of place.
Rattle.
It is incredibly modern.
The ceiling light, the button beside the door, even the mirror on the wall.
Behind the mirror, a barbarian and a magician stood in full gear, but even then, stepping into this elevator made me question whether this place was a part of the modern world.
"But how do you operate this elevator? Usually, you speak to the attendant and request them to operate it…"
Raven's voice, filled with curiosity, made me instinctively press the button.
Because, apart from opening and closing, there was only one button.
"Oh! It, it's moving!"
The elevator started moving as soon as the floor number was pressed.
It feels like I’m going up, not down...
"...Hey, Yandel, say something. It's scary when you’re quiet like that."
"…"
"I don’t know what'll happen when this thing stops, and the door opens…"
Honestly… I’m scared too.
What will be on the other side of this door when it opens?
I can’t even begin to imagine it.
Wooosh...
So, I just waited patiently.
I was ready to swing my weapon at any moment, but I didn’t tense up too much.
One, two, three…
I silently counted, regulating my breathing.
And then.
‘50 seconds.’
About 50 seconds later.
Wooosh...
The elevator began to slow down, gently coming to a stop. The doors opened slowly, revealing the long-awaited sight beyond the door.
Firstly, 
It felt like a hotel lobby.
A chandelier and a small fountain in the center.
A gleaming marble floor.
And…
Thump.
A single knight standing before us.
"…"
The knight stared at us, showing no signs of surprise.
As if he had known we were coming.
Standing in the middle, in the posture of a royal guard on duty, he didn't ask a single question.
‘…What the hell? A mid-boss right from the start?’
If this was a game, it felt like we had encountered a mid-boss as soon as we entered the dungeon.
Because I knew it the moment I saw him.
That he was no pushover.
‘Well, if he's guarding this place, then that says it all.’
Of course, I didn't feel intimidated or anything.
After all, who am I?
A super-strong barbarian who wouldn't lose to anyone who uses ‘aura.’
That’s me.
The only issue was whether I could protect Raven, who was standing behind me...
Swoosh.
Thinking that, I stepped back to secure a position where it would be easier to protect Raven.
The knight pulled out his sword smoothly, aiming at me.
And…
‘…What?’
That was all.
Swoosh-!
By the time I regained my senses, there was a thin line across my cheek.
Drizzle.
The stinging pain, followed by a trickle of blood, came belatedly.
‘I was cut……?’
Unbelievable.
Of course, it wasn’t impossible for this knight to be such a masterful swordsman that he could cut me before I even noticed.
It’s also not impossible for this world to have knights and barbarians standing more than twenty paces apart.
But…
"…"
"Interesting."
If an attack like that could pierce through my physical defense and draw blood, then it would be a whole different story.
This bastard didn’t even use aura.
‘If not aura, then…‘
Ignoring the cut on my cheek, I glared at the bastard, or rather, at the sword in his hand.
‘Is it the sword?’
The secret behind the previous attack was more likely to be in the sword.
Of course, it was a completely new sword.
Even after scouring my internal database, I couldn't find any item like this.
But if not the sword, then I have no explanation.
Therefore…
‘I need to somehow get the sword away from him or prevent him from using it… I need to induce a battle by—’
I was still pondering how to fight when.
Click.
As if the previous attack was meant to establish dominance, the knight put away his sword and turned his back.
And…
"Follow me."
He turned around and began walking across the marble floor, his footsteps echoing.
Raven, who was behind me, cautiously asked, peeking her head out.
"Uh, where are we going…?"
Her voice was like that of a terrified herbivore.
The knight answered without looking back, his back towards us.
"The audience chamber."
“…Yes?"
I was completely unprepared for this.
"The Breaker King has granted you an audience."
…I never thought I’d get a chance to meet the King like this.
