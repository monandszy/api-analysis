## The Third Record (5)
To be honest, I never expected it. The knight standing on the execution platform, delivering the emperor's message to the assembled crowd, was the village elder.
"No wonder I couldn't figure out how to escape on my own," I thought.
Now I see it wasn't an unfair chapter, but a chapter where I had to wait for my comrades to rescue me.
"Swoosh!"
The elder, who had just removed his helmet, slashed at the ropes with his sword. A shriek of protest rose from below.
"Sir Saintred! Why would you betray...!"
"Sir?"
"You've been a noble knight from the very beginning, haven't you? I'll tell you more later," he said, his gaze shifting from me to the plaza below.
"Whoosh—!"
The magic circle engulfing the plaza glowed brighter with each passing moment, and the chaos among the thousands of people grew.
"Aaaah!"
"Get out of the way!"
"Don't push! Aaaah!"
It was absolute pandemonium as thousands of people attempted to escape the confines of the square. The elder, overlooking the chaos, addressed me.
"Isn't it fascinating to see them struggle for their lives?"
It was a whisper that would make any psychopath blush. But the next words he uttered were more puzzling.
"It's not a magic for killing, you see."
"Not an attack spell?"
"Sir Basilius said it would be impossible to manage the aftermath if we caused a massacre here. But I can't just escape with you two through this crowd. That's why this magic is perfect. It took a lot of work to set it up."
"So, what kind of magic is it?"
The elder smiled, a smile that was no longer awkward, and answered my question.
"You'll see when it happens."
Oh, this guy, he never gives a proper explanation, does he?
"By the way, are you alright?"
"Don't worry, I won't be a burden when it's time to fight."
"That's reassuring, but… I think we won't actually have to fight."
"We won't...?"
"Oh, it seems it's finished."
He ignored my question, his gaze turning away from me once more.
And then, in that instant.
"Flash—!"
A blinding light engulfed the entire city, a wave of energy so strong it sent a sharp pain through my eyes. As the light faded and my vision recovered, I finally understood the nature of the magic.
"What are you waiting for? Let's go. Everyone's waiting for you."
The plaza, which had been a scene of pandemonium, was now empty.
***
It was a teleportation spell. Or perhaps a multi-teleportation spell? Hmm… I'm not sure that fully explains it either. The maximum capacity of a multi-teleportation spell is twenty people. It's impossible to teleport thousands of people like that all at once.
But…
"There was a similar case once, wasn't there?"
It happened in the underground city of Noark. A mysterious old man, presumed to be Auril Gaviss, vanished with over ten thousand people, escaping the royal family's siege. I've only heard tales of it; I never saw it with my own eyes. But…
If I had witnessed that event, wouldn't it have felt like this?
"Let's go inside," he said, leading me to a secluded residence on the outskirts of the city.
"Kwang!"
We entered the empty house, descended a hidden staircase in the floor, and only then were we able to remove the robes that hid our faces.
"You said everyone's waiting?"
"They haven't arrived yet. They'll be here soon. Sit down and rest."
"Erwen, are you hurt?"
"I'm fine."
I had Erwen sit down and checked her condition. After confirming she was alright, I turned to the elder. I had to ask.
"Why did you use that teleportation spell on our enemies? It would have been more efficient to use it on us."
Honestly, I was more curious about why he used that large-scale teleportation spell at all, rather than how he managed to do it. 
But the elder answered as if it was nothing. 
"Didn't you know? Magic doesn't work on witches. It wouldn't matter with just you, but if I wanted to escape with both of you, this was the only way."
Ah, I see. That explains it. It's the first time I've heard that magic doesn't work on witches.
"Is there anything you want to tell me before the others arrive?"
"Nothing in particular."
"Then let's wait a bit. We can talk about everything else later."
I had no intention of repeating the same questions, so I followed the elder's advice and waited, resting for a while.
After what felt like an eternity, a figure approached. 
"Forgive me. I took a detour because I felt like someone was following me."
It was Gahyun Basilius, one of the members of this Rift. He glanced at me and Erwen, then spoke cautiously. 
"Say… Lord Viscount, is it really you?"
"That's a strange question."
"Ha, it really is you. That's a relief," he said, his voice laced with relief.
An exchange filled with a strange dissonance. 
"Really you?"
"Ah, the Viscount was acting entirely different before. He didn't even know this was inside the Rift—"
"Ha, everyone's already here except me."
At that moment, the final member of this Rift arrived. The Archbishop of the Reatlas Church, Eiden Hestaia.
"Sorry I'm late. Getting inside was easy, but it was a bit of a hassle carrying all this heavy equipment."
He said, inverting a spatial bag he was carrying on his back and shaking it. 
"Rattle, rattle, rattle."
What poured out like a waterfall, covering most of the floor, was none other than my equipment. Oh, I was so worried about how I'd get it back. I never thought he'd bring it with him.
"I checked it over and over, so I don't think anything is missing… but just in case, Lord Viscount, would you check it one more time?"
I rushed to put on my armor and store my belongings. Fortunately, nothing was missing. 
Even though I'm a barbarian who worships the spirits of my ancestors, I couldn't help but say it.
"May the stars in the twilight guide us…."
"Ha, it's delightful to see Lord Viscount so happy. That makes me smile too."
"Now that everyone's here, let's get to the point."
The elder, regaining control of the dispersing atmosphere, turned to me and asked. 
"So, tell me what happened to you. Tell me everything, from beginning to end."
Erwen and I briefly summarized what happened in Chapters 1 and 2, including how we woke up on the gallows. Then the other three shared their experiences, and we exchanged information. 
Each of us had a different starting point for Chapter 1. Let's start with Gahyun Basilius, the non-mage.
"I woke up in a magical education institution. There were a few incidents, but the bottom line is that I received a medal from the imperial family for defending against monsters during a practical training session. That evening, I received a letter from my hometown. It said the imperial army had attacked the village, and my sister was missing. The sender… claimed to be a friend, but I didn't recognize the name."
Anyway, he read that letter, and Chapter 1 ended.
"It was a vast wasteland where sand blew in the wind. We all met there," Gahyun said, continuing the story from Chapter 2.
He was able to reunite with the elder and the archbishop in Chapter 2.
"To explain this part, I need to tell you our story first."
The elder and the archbishop's stories were also simple. The elder started as a knight from a noble family, and the archbishop started with the status of a priest who belonged to the temple. They each had their own individual incidents.
Then...
"We received a letter signed with Basilius' name at the end. It said his sister was in trouble, and pleaded for our help. From the context, it seemed the three of us were all close friends."
And sure enough, Chapter 1 ended as soon as we read the letter.  The three of them were all together when Chapter 2 started. 
The main event of Chapter 2 was a group of pursuers who were secretly trailing us. 
"It wasn't too difficult to fight them off… but even after waiting for you two at the rendezvous point mentioned in Basilius' letter, you didn't appear."
They waited endlessly in the desert city, the rendezvous point.  Then, the imperial army arrived. 
"They told Basilius that his sister was a being who would destroy the world. They told him that if he wanted to stop her, he had to help them."
Of course, there was no option to refuse. 
The moment he heard those words, Chapter 4 began.
From then on, the chapter's mission was clear. They carried out the imperial orders as they were given.
Chapter 5, Chapter 6, Chapter 7… 
They fought in wars against monsters and achieved great feats.  But they were never able to catch us and join forces.
"We were almost there.  I thought this time we could finally catch you two and talk. But as if by magic, something would always go wrong, and we'd lose sight of you."
Yet, the chapters kept flowing, and with each one, the information was updated. His sister was called a witch, and I was her follower. 
Then, we reached Chapter 11.
"I woke up in this city. Countless troops surrounded us. It was only after we escaped their siege that I learned how we ended up like this."
The witch and her follower were caught, and the empire tried to get rid of them.
"The purpose of this trial became clear."
The three of them infiltrated the prison to meet us. They didn't intend to rescue us on the spot, but rather to tell us what was going on first...
"As I said, you weren't you when we met then. So, we just told you about the plan to rescue you on the day of the execution and left."
And the situation that followed was what happened just a moment ago.
The day of the execution dawned, and we, who had only completed two chapters, finally reunited with these three after waking up in Chapter 11. 
That was the story of all the events that have taken place until now…
"At least we haven't been locked up here for over ten years."
Gahyun Basilius erupted at my brief mutter.
"No-oooo-ooo!"
"Huh?"
"What do you mean, 'over ten years'? Even if it wasn't ten years, we still had to be stuck here for at least half a year!"
"What? Half a year?"
According to his continued lamentations, apparently more than a month had already passed just in this Chapter 11.
This was a chilling story.
"This Rift… it even manipulates the passage of time."
I hope when we get out, a few years haven't already passed. Please, not this time. I've had enough of being left behind in time.
"Basilius, calm down. We have a lot more to talk about."
"Forgive me, I got carried away. I apologize."
The elder calmed the atmosphere and continued the conversation. 
"Lord Viscount, this Rift is different from ordinary Rifts. Each of us has unique abilities. Before we ask about yours, let me explain ours first."
"Ah, I'll be the first to tell you mine."
Archbishop Hestaia began.
"My divine spells are just as powerful as before, but my divine power is practically infinite. No matter how many divine miracles I perform, grace overflows like a spring that never runs dry."
In short, it's an infinite divine power buff. Well, it seems like there's a handicap as well. 
"But, in exchange, no divine miracles can be used on me."
A priest who can only use divine power for others. 
"Then what about you, Viscount?"
"My case is much simpler than the others. I'm about twice as strong as before, in every aspect, and I haven't found any restrictions yet."
So, it's a 200% increase in all stats with no penalties? That's an incredibly OP buff. On the one hand, I feel a sense of anticipation, but on the other hand, I'm also feeling a little uneasy.
"If they give out buffs like this, what's going to happen next?"
I'm already worried about the final boss's difficulty.  There's bound to be a guardian here, as this is a Rift.
"Anyway, what about you, Gahyun?"
"I can use a new spell with each trial. I don't understand the workings of them exactly… it feels like a normal person using a scroll to cast magic."
"New spells, you say?"
"They're ancient spells that were lost long ago, spells whose principles I can't even glimpse."
Now it makes sense. I wondered who cast that spell that teleported thousands of people. It was an ability he gained after entering this Rift.
"Oh, and I have one more ability," he added. 
"What is it?"
"I have a sixth sense that tells me what we need to do with each trial."
"Well, that's… quite a useful ability."
I threw in some vague praise, but sighed inwardly. He wasn't lying about it being a good ability. In fact, it's quite the opposite. This unkind game is giving him a navigation system for free… what's really going to happen?
"Then it's our turn," I said.
I then explained the abilities we'd discovered so far, ending the long information-sharing session.
"But… Miss Tersia, why haven't you said anything this whole time?"
"That… is none of your concern."
"Hmm… I apologize for the transgression. Forgive me."
It felt like an unnecessary barb to say to a priest with such a kind face, but I didn't dwell on it. 
"Now that I think about it, she's been acting a little strange..."
She was a bit different from her usual self.  She answered my questions politely, but she didn't start conversations and chatter as much as she usually did.
"Well, it's still early for night, so everyone, please rest," he said.
Hmm… She's not the kind of person who keeps so quiet.
***
"The role assigned to Gahyun Basilius is 'Mage'. He can use ancient magic." 
"The role assigned to Jerome Saintred is 'Knight'. All stats are increased by 200%."
"The role assigned to Eiden Hestaia is 'Priest'. He no longer consumes divine power. He cannot use divine spells on himself. All mental resistance stats are fixed to 0."
