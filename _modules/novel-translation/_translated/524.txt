## Chapter 524: Giant Island (3)
The sixth floor contained a windless zone. It was a place devoid of wind and nearly all currents, necessitating the use of magical engineering propulsion devices. The propulsion device was not exclusive to this zone, though; it found application elsewhere on the high seas, as situations requiring acceleration were commonplace.
With a high-pitched whine, the motor mounted on the ship's hull roared to life, fueled by the magic stones I had gathered.  A powerful surge of water erupted, propelling the ship forward at an unprecedented speed. 
"Lower the sails!" 
I commanded, and the sails, which had been billowing in the wind, collapsed, further boosting our velocity. With the propulsion device engaged, the sails often became an obstacle.
"Uughh!"
"Hold on tight, everyone!"
On the deck, buffeted by the ship’s fierce momentum, everyone scrambled to cling onto anything they could reach, desperately trying to maintain their balance. 
After a while,  a voice rang out.
"Sir, I can’t see them anymore!" 
The giant heads, once diligently pursuing us, were now out of sight. It seemed they had abandoned their chase, realizing that catching up was impossible.
"Did we shake them off…?" 
While a sense of relief washed over me, it was premature to celebrate.
"Captain, what about the propulsion device?"
"Keep it activated. We might still be within their territory. We need to get out of here as quickly as possible."
"Yes, sir."
This silver sea housed different sea monsters in different regions.  The route from the Rock Island to the Library Island harbored the  Macguries. The path to the Human Island was home to the Tentaculans. Based on this pattern, the waters we were in now were likely the territory of the Hipramajents.
"This level is filled with unpredictable creatures." 
One moment we encounter a rank 7 monster, the next a rank 4. This was, after all, the norm.  But seven rank 2 Hipramajents? This was no longer a sea, it was a death trap. 
“And don't forget, a rank 1 monster roams these waters..."
Maybe I had been too hasty in descending to the first floor.  But I quickly dismissed the thought. I had always been reckless in my explorations.  Such uncharted and perilous lands, full of mysteries and dangers, promised great rewards if I could survive.
“Besides, think about the value of the essence I’ve gathered so far… ”
“I should prioritize finding a way back. I can always upgrade my gear and come back later.”
"Auyen, where are we now?"
"It's hard to tell precisely, given the sudden increase in speed. However, based on my calculations, we should be near the target area.”
The target area?
If so, we had covered a 6-hour journey in just two hours.
I was both amazed by the propulsion device's performance and secretly worried.  Its notorious poor cost-effectiveness was no secret.
“How many magic stones have we consumed?”
“We’ve used over 90% of the magic stones you entrusted me with.”
In other words, we had burnt a quarter of the magic stones we had acquired during this expedition in just two hours.
“That’s about 20 million stones in monetary terms… ”
The thought of that number sent a pang of pain through me, but I felt a little better knowing that 20 million stones was the price I’d paid for my life.  We could always mine more stones.
"We’ll need to recalculate our course then… Could you focus for a little while?"
"Oh, sorry for the distraction."
Auyen then continued navigating, skillfully manipulating the nautical tools he had glanced at earlier. He soon spotted the island.
Müller Armin, who had been observing from the side, let out an exclamation.
“That person… is Auyen Rockrobe, right?”
"What about it?"
"He’s an incredible talent. I wonder why his name isn’t better known in the city.”
Müller showered me with compliments about my good navigator, but it was more than just polite words.
"What makes you say that?"
"Our expedition team doesn’t have a separate navigator. I handle that role. That's why I can tell. It’s incredibly challenging to navigate accurately here, without the sun or stars, while traveling at such speed."
"Oh, is that so…?"
"Yes. Your nautical charts are incredibly detailed. I would love to learn from you if I ever get the chance.”
Müller’s sincere compliments left me at a loss for words, and I could only laugh awkwardly.
“They say heroes attract people, and it seems like an old adage holds true.”
"Ahem…"
I had simply recruited him because I was hesitant to kill a plunderer after defeating him…
***
We had finally reached our destination. Instead of docking immediately, I ordered a full circle around the island, observing it closely.  I then steered the ship towards the southern coast, instead of the northern one, which was composed of steep cliffs.
"What do you think, Müller? Do you think we found the right place?"
"Yes, it matches all the characteristics they described."
The island, at least ten times the size of the Human Island, had a striking feature—immense trees that were immediately visible upon landing.
“I noticed this even from the ship...”
“They’re colossal.”
“Wow… My neck hurts looking up!”
Every single tree, seemingly growing nonchalantly, was larger than any I had ever seen in the Labyrinth.  They were the height of a ten-story apartment building…
"I... "
As we prepared to move inland, someone approached me. 
It was a magician from the Armin expedition team.
“I… uhm… ”
“If you have something to say, speak up."
“May I… take a bit of this wood? I’ve never seen anything like it… ”
He asked hesitantly, his eyes sparkling with eagerness.
Magicians, always like that.  I had been so accustomed to dealing with Versil, a former player, that I found myself feeling a little unfamiliar.
"It might be a valuable material. And if it is, it would be a significant gain for your lord as well…"
"Those would take a long time to harvest, at this size."
“…Just a small bit would do.”
"Well, if you say so."
I then had Einar help the magician collect a sample, a piece of wood roughly the size of a standard log, including some bark.  They were real magicians, unlike Versil.  Perhaps they might discover something even during our exploration.
“Thank you! Thank you!”
The magician,  elated as if he had received a precious treasure, bowed profusely.  He then excitedly walked away to share the news with his fellow magicians, beaming as he spoke.
"You really found it!"
“I wish it were night already. I want to start researching.”
“Hee hee hee… Don't forget, everyone. We agreed that any research conducted here will have a shared authorship.”
Why are they so excited about this wood?
Anyway, after making sure the magicians were content, I organized our formation and moved inland.  I was cautious, unsure what awaited us.
After a while, a voice broke the silence.
“Yandell, something’s coming toward us.”
We had only been on the island for 30 minutes, and we were already encountering a monster. Everyone went on high alert, ready for battle.  But…
“……..?”
When the monster appeared, we all stared in disbelief.
Its stature barely reached my calves, even in its [Giant] state.  It had green skin, a wide-open mouth, and was clutching a small carving knife in its tiny hands.
[Grrk?!]
“….Goblins?” 
I never expected to encounter goblins here.  My shoulders slumped, but I forced myself to regain composure and shouted at the team.
“Don’t underestimate them! This might be a creature with an ability to alter its appearance–”
[The goblin has cast [Trap Creation]]
“…Huh?”
The goblin, right before our eyes, casually created a trap and tossed it in front of us.  Then…
“……..”
[…….]
A strange silence descended upon the group.
"That guy..."
"Is it waiting for us to step on it?"
I forced myself to stay focused.
“Don’t let your guard down… Goblins aren’t this stupid. This is clearly a goblin unlike any we've seen before.  Perhaps it has an ability that sets it apart–”
Just then, an arrow shot out, piercing the goblin’s head.
And…
Whooooosh!
A ‘Instant Death’ message appeared, and the goblin’s body disintegrated into light.
“……..”
“……..?”
…What? It was just a regular goblin?  What have I been doing all this time?
A wave of self-disappointment washed over me.
[Grrrk!!]
[Grrrk!! Grrrk! Krrrk!!]
The goblins, witnessing their comrade’s death, began howling in fury. 
And simultaneously.
Whoooosh!
The goblins’ tiny bodies swelled.
“…Huh?”
They were now large enough to reach my calves.  They seemed to have gained more muscle as well…
[The goblin has cast [Giant]]
…What is this?
***
Dispatching the goblins was easy. Even with their increase in size, they were still just goblins. The fight itself was too simple to call it a fight. 
But the impact of this battle was significant. 
“That just now… ”
“Maybe it’s… ”
Everyone’s eyes turned to me, forgetting to even collect the magic stones the goblins had left behind.  Perhaps they thought my eyes, belonging to someone who possessed [Giant], would provide the most accurate assessment. 
“….I’m not sure yet.”
“Is, is that right?” 
Everyone, except for Amelia, fell silent.
“It doesn't matter if you're sure. We just want to hear what you think. Did it seem like [Giant] to you?”
“….Yes.”
“Interesting. It’s unlikely all of them are high-level variants."
The goblins we had encountered were a significant departure from the norm.  After all, they weren't a new species of monster.
"But the ability to use another creature’s skill…" 
Is this a unique trait of these goblins?  Or could other goblins do it too?
That question was answered soon enough during our exploration. 
[The troll has cast [Giant]]
[The werewolf has cast [Giant]]
[The iron golem has cast [Gi……. ]]
[……. ]
Every monster we encountered along the way displayed [Giant] in addition to their inherent abilities.
The exact mechanism was unknown.  But…
“The island.”
This island surely holds a special something. The monsters we met on other islands didn’t do this.
“Is this like a special field effect exclusive to this island?”
That was the first guess that came to mind, but it wasn’t something I could be certain of.  So this time, I decided to enlist the help of the magicians.
"What about the essence?"
"All the wavelength measurements and patterns match those of existing essence.”
"Are you saying it’s no different from the essence of the goblin we encountered on the first floor?”
"Yes… at least, based on the measurements, that's what it looks like.  It’s highly unlikely that consuming this essence will grant you [Giant]. Of course, we could test it on a volunteer… if you wanted to…."
“That’s okay. It's not important enough to go that far.”
We resumed our exploration.  Our objectives were twofold.
Firstly, to gather information about this new island.
Secondly, to locate and rescue any explorers stranded there.
The first objective was still quite vague, but luckily, we found a clue related to the second objective much sooner than expected.
“It’s a footprint.  Not a beast’s, but a person’s.”
During our exploration, we stumbled upon someone’s footprints.  One of the members of the Armin expedition team, an expert on this topic, confirmed that the shoes had been made at a specific boutique in Laphdonia.
“He was once a member of the Royal Investigation Department. You can trust his assessment.”
“Quite a distinguished person, then. Can you tell when these footprints were made?”
"About… five hours ago.”
Thank goodness. I’d been worried that they were all dead.  Apparently, there were survivors.
