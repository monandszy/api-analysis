## Chapter 665: Companionship (4)
An uncomfortable companionship began outside the city walls.  However, there were undeniable advantages to such a journey.  For one thing, a trove of information, like honeyed sweets, poured out before our journey even began.
"Where are we now… hmm, would you like to take a look at our map?"
Lee Baek-ho, who had ventured outside the walls far earlier than us.  Unfortunately, the map he created was not of high quality.  It was like a map made before the discovery of the Americas.  Not that I think I would have done any better.  Anyway…
"... What is this border line?  It looks familiar."
The map, which was still under construction, displayed a mysterious border line.  It felt like the borders drawn on a world map.
"Oh, that's the boundary line that matches the terrain of the 7th Layer's Dark Continent."
… No wonder the border line seemed familiar. It was the shape of the Dark Continent.
"Isn't it amazing?  Originally, in the Labyrinth, the coastline ends here, making it impossible to go beyond.  But here, the land continues beyond it."
I couldn't argue with the statement, "Isn't it amazing?"  The map Lee Baek-ho showed was truly impressive.
The clown said the outside world resembled the Dark Continent, but that was only a small part of the whole. The Dark Continent was located in the southeastern part of the continent, while the northern and western regions were filled with uncharted lands.
"What is this circle marked here?"
"Oh, that? It's an island."
"Island…?"
"There's that one island on the 6th Layer. You know, the one with the mysterious, strange stone monument in the center."
"You mean Stanels Island?"
"Yes, yes, that one. It has a very similar terrain to this island.  Even the monsters that appear here are the same."
"So that's it…."
A strange coincidence… but it felt too uneasy to simply dismiss.  An island that should be in the middle of the ocean was attached to the mainland. Was this also entangled with secrets of the world I don't know about yet? 
I didn't know, but at least my knowledge was steadily expanding.
"So this must be the eastern region of the Great Forest."
Lee Baek-ho quipped, "To be precise, it's the southeastern part of the Great Forest."  But that was a trivial detail I could simply ignore.
"So where are we going from here?"
"Here."
Lee Baek-ho pointed with his finger to an uncharted territory outside the Dark Continent.
"We can obtain most of the materials that guy mentioned earlier from this place."
"How long will it take?"
"Walking? About half a year?"
"……What?"
That meant it would be a whole year before we got back.  What a waste of time!
I glared at him, frowning.  Lee Baek-ho laughed playfully.
"Don't worry.  We'll be taking a portal in between. We'll get there in less than a month."
"Portal…?"
What was this nonsense?
"It's like the military elevators in Raphdonia. You know, the ones that connect specific locations.  It's just connecting specific points."
It was truly a new world.  The more I learned about the outside world, the more I felt like I was back in my newbie days.  Like playing a new game.
"Well, let's get going.  We'll be moving with the intention of reaching the portal tonight. Everyone, follow me closely."
... It felt like we were riding on some kind of bus.
***
In [Dungeon & Stone], 'time' is very important.  Because in the Labyrinth, each layer has a set time for when the field closes.  If you don't use your time efficiently, you won't be able to climb to the higher floors naturally...
Whoooosh!
In a way, this is also an advantage for a 민캐 (Min-cae, meaning a player who doesn't specialize in any particular class).  Explorers, regardless of their position, must complete their own 'movement system', but 민캐s naturally achieve this.  Unlike the 힘캐s (Him-cae, meaning a player who specializes in strength).
'Ugh… I'm the only one struggling with this.'
Kuuung-! Kuuung-!
As I ran through the forest, making heavy footsteps, I kept getting hit with the 'wise man's time'.  Because I still hadn't figured out how to create my movement system.  At least my stamina and energy levels were high so I didn't tire easily…
Kuuung-! Kuuung-!
My movement speed was significantly behind that of other classes.  Just like this.
Whoooosh!
[HIIIII-!]
Even GM, a wizard, was flying quickly using levitation magic and combining various spells.  And a healer named Zena was riding on her summoned mount comfortably.  And…
‘... This is really embarrassing.’
I was trailing behind everyone, barely keeping up.  I could sense that the entire group could go faster but was slowing down for me.  Was this what they called unspoken consideration?
"Hahaha!  This is truly interesting!  It's been a long time since I've seen someone who moves slower than me!"
… Damn it.  How could this damn tank complete their movement system so quickly?  Why didn't they use that time to get stronger?
'Tsk.'
I clicked my tongue inwardly, secretly scanning the woman in front of me who was comfortably riding on her mount.
'Contract monster… so the Priest of Carui was right.'
I could tell her class by looking at her mount, but it didn't really matter.  They probably wanted to reveal it since hiding her class would be difficult anyway.
"Well, at least we got here before morning."
We arrived at our destination at dawn, after late night, and had a short break.
"We'll rest here today.  We don't have enough time to replenish our magic levels as expected…."
"We don't have to change the schedule.  Havellion is with us now."
"Oh, good."
"Havellion, come here.  We should check your magic wave beforehand to be safe."
"Yes?  Oh, yes…!"
While everyone else rested, GM was called away by the Doombringer, and they coordinated something I couldn't understand.  Then…
"Can I talk to you for a sec?"
Lee Baek-ho quietly approached and called me to a secluded spot.
"We're really meant to be, aren't we?  I never thought I'd be hanging out with you like this."
"……"
"Oh, don't worry.  No one's going to hear us!"
"Ugh…."
I glanced around before sighing and glared at Lee Baek-ho.  I had so much to say, starting from the strange way he told me how to get out, but I swallowed it for now.
"But hyung, I've been wanting to ask you this.  Does GM know that you're a player?"
"Yeah.  They don't, so just act like you normally do."
"Wow, if they knew your identity, their face would be priceless."
Hmm, I was curious too, but I couldn't check it just to find out.  So I let it go.
"I also have something I want to ask you.  Is it okay?"
"Yes, ask away."
Lee Baek-ho readily agreed, so I asked the question I'd been wanting to ask.
"The Noark entered the city. You said it was because they wanted to survive, right?"
"Right?"
"What does that mean exactly?"
"Oh, that…."
"Since I'm out here too, just be honest with me.  Okay?  The ash-gray world, is that why they did it?"
I asked, not hiding my frustration.  Lee Baek-ho seemed to think for a moment before nodding.
"Ash-gray world... that's a pretty poetic and perfect expression, isn't it?"
"I don't care about that. Just answer the question.  Okay?"
"It doesn't really matter, to be honest. It's not a big threat anyway."
"... Not a threat?"
"Anyway, that's not the point…  The reason the Noark went back to the city to die is different."
Lee Baek-ho paused for a moment and looked at me.  What was he going to say, making me wait like this...
"There's a monster, you see."
"……Huh?"
"It's a really, really scary monster."
Even with that emphasis, I still didn't understand what he was saying.  I gave him a look that urged him to elaborate, and Lee Baek-ho shrugged.
"It doesn't seem to have a specific habitat.  It appeared no matter where we went.  Every time it showed up, thousands of people died without being able to do anything…."
"Died…?"
"The only thing we've figured out so far is that the more people are around, and the longer those people stay outside the walls, the higher the chance of it appearing."
As soon as I heard that, a sense of unease washed over me.  It was a kind of confusing feeling, like I knew something but didn't at the same time.  Why did I get this feeling?  While I pondered over the reason, Lee Baek-ho asked me a question.
"Hyung, don't you think it's similar?"
"……"
"The monster appearing when conditions are met, doesn't it seem a lot like the Layer Master?"
Ah, that's right.  That was it.
***
"So it's still dangerous now?"
"Well, it's a possibility.  But what can we do?  The way back home is already blocked.  We're a small group and haven't been out for long, so we have to believe in this."
Ugh, even with that explanation, I couldn't shake off the unease.  Because I hated probabilities.  Like how 0 and 1 are completely different numbers, probabilities don't matter if they're not 0%.  Something will happen if it has a chance to happen.
'I wish I hadn't heard this….'
That thought crossed my mind, but I believe it's better to know than to be caught off guard.  So I kept asking about the 'monster', and I heard something I never expected.
"It's not actually that destructive or imposing…."
"Not?"
"It doesn't deal any damage.  None at all."
"... Huh?"
"Seriously.  Magic, aura, skills, everything.  It's immune."
The moment I heard that, I thought, 'Does this even make sense?'  A monster that can't be killed, not even contained by any means? 
"That's why its nickname is Grim Reaper.  Grim Reaper."
It seemed like a fitting nickname, at least based on the description.  Especially since it's something humans can't resist.
"Oh really…?"
"How do you feel?  Does it give you chills?"
Well, I don't know.  How do I explain this?  Along with fear, I felt a growing sense of curiosity.  It was an instinctive reaction, a gamer's nature.
'Tsk, there must be some way to counter it….'
Right?  Even monsters with seemingly unbeatable gimmicks eventually get countered when you keep hitting their heads.  Well, you can't just hit their heads in reality.  But it's a natural instinct to think this way…
"What kind of loot does it give…?"
I muttered unconsciously, and Lee Baek-ho tilted his head slightly before opening his mouth wide.
"Wow… hyung, you're crazy too."
... What?  Like there aren't other sane and healthy barbarians out there.
"That's enough. So what's the deal with that?"
"What?"
I changed the subject and threw a new question at him.
"You said there's some kind of event a year from now."
"Oh… that…?"
"You might not be able to get back until then, so can't you just tell me?  Huh?  Tell me what happens to the ash-gray world, what's going to happen?"
I asked, not hiding my frustration.  Lee Baek-ho cut off my additional questions.
"I can't.  You might be able to go back before then."
But even through that response, I could deduce a few things.
'That's what made him angry.'
When the magic circle broke, Lee Baek-ho got really angry and tried to find a way to get back to the city as quickly as possible.  This suggests it's connected to that 'event'.  Also...
'He doesn't want me to know the details.'
He thinks that if I know about the event, I will somehow interfere or get in the way.  In simpler terms, that event would most likely be bad for me…
"I'm going now!"
As expected, Lee Baek-ho ran away as soon as the conversation started getting uncomfortable.  Then…
"Oh, it seems like you were doing something with the old guy. Are you done?"
"Yes.  Checking the magic wave won't take that long."
"Okay."
GM, who had finished their task, cautiously requested a private audience.
"Could you spare me some time?"
Okay, it's your turn now.  I pretended not to know anything and followed him, but he stopped in a secluded spot and immediately began speaking after turning on voice control.
"This might be an intrusive question…."
"It's fine.  Just speak freely."
"What's your relationship with Lee Baek-ho…?"
Ugh, how do I even explain this?
