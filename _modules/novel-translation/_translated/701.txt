## The Bargain
"Well, it's not like I don't care. It's just that I know how most of those who give in to kidnappers end up. These bastards never know satisfaction. Give them an inch, they'll take a mile, give them a mile, they'll want a continent. That's why..."
"Behel—laaaAAAAAAA!!"
"...The only way to beat these bastards is this." 
*Crack*
I slammed my forehead into his with all my might, holding it there as I stared him down.
"You think someone with a lot to lose can't be beaten?"
No way. This guy must be delusional.
"I've never been beaten." 
"..."
"Not without losing something."
My name is Lee Han-Soo, also known as Bjorn Jandel. A player, and a warrior fighting for survival.
In the labyrinth, my role is to protect my allies with my shield. I never ran, no matter the situation. 
The paths I walked taught me one thing:  running protects nothing.
"..."
Ignoring the look of disgust in his eyes, I pushed him away and continued.
"Lee Baek-Ho, if I lose something, so will you."
And by the way, don't even try to say…
"You have nothing to lose."
"..."
"Because I'm going to take the one thing you want most. No matter what it takes."
Lee Baek-Ho didn't utter a single word as I spoke. He just stared at me, gauging whether my resolve was genuine. 
And I did the same. I refused to say anything like, ‘Why do you think I can't?’ I simply met his gaze, unwavering.
This was a game of chicken.  Two individuals, each with the power to destroy the other, facing off to see who had the bigger balls. It didn't take long to see the outcome.
Lee Baek-Ho, he was more rational than I am.
"So, what exactly do you want me to do?"
His voice was weak, a sign of resignation at the situation spiraling out of his control.
"Do you want money? Or blood? I can give you a healer, a tank… maybe even two, but that old geezer, forget it. If you push me, we'll go all the way."
Right, that old geezer is untouchable.
"And don’t even think about neutering him!"
The little bastard, still has his mouth. 
Watching Baek-Ho back down, I briefly contemplated my next move. The answer didn’t take long to arrive.
"I'm not making a proposal."
"..."
"You're begging. On your knees."
Baek-Ho’s jaw clenched, his pride wounded. But did reason prevail, did he decide that following my orders was the best option?
"I… apologize for… disrespecting… the Baron. Please… forgive… me… for my… actions… today…."
His voice was awkward, like a child who'd never apologized before. It was ridiculous, I wanted to laugh, but I held it in. Instead, I slapped him on the back of the head.
*Thwack*
“What?! You apologized, why hit me? Don’t you even accept apologies?”
He’s got the audacity to play the victim?
“That’s not it, it’s just..."
“…Yeah?”
“I just felt like it."
Ah, feels good.
This wasn't just a change of pace, it was a brand new experience. Looking at that sullen face brought back a flood of past grievances.  
[Hmmm, weird. You've made a name for yourself, but I don’t think the GM is interested.]
[Don’t answer, I'll kill that Feline.] [Suddenly so friendly?] It started from the moment he didn’t know I was Lee Han-Soo. 
[Sorry, but I can’t give you the Kitty back.] [Did you get your ears checked after being a Barbarian?][Don't pretend you're the only sane one. It's disgusting.]
Even the times I'd called him out despite knowing the truth.
All those incidents replayed in my mind like a panorama, a thrilling rush of exhilaration coursing through my entire body.
‘To have him apologize….’
Sure, it wasn’t a genuine apology… but when was the last time someone actually apologized to me? I'm satisfied.
‘Authenticity’ doesn't put food on the table anyway.
“So… is that it then…?”
Baek-Ho looked at me with the eyes of a guilty puppy.  Of course, my answer was predetermined.
While it was the right thing to do to stand my ground and accept the potential loss, to not be swayed by Baek-Ho anymore.
I couldn’t stand to go all the way with him either.
"Actually, what did I do wrong? I was just trying to ask a few questions." 
There are no winners in the end. Only losers surviving in hell. ‘Well, at least he backed down this time.’
Pushing him further now would be irrational.  There's only one thing I need to do now.
"Besides, the whole thing started with the Baron, right? If he hadn’t been acting shady inside with that old geezer and gotten out late—"
"Enough with the excuses."
I cut off his habitual blame game,  my tone resolute.
"Whether I let this go or not depends on what you mean by 'paying me back'."
In other words, don't try to brush this off.  Pay me enough to make it worth my while.
"How much will it take?  And can I pay in items? I don't carry much cash on me."
Baek-Ho sighed, but I refused to answer.  It's the side that's losing who needs to make the offer first.
"..."
As I stared him down, Baek-Ho cautiously made his proposition.
“…How about 200 million stones per person?”
The little bastard wants to bargain even now?
"300 million stones per person."
My response was firm, leaving no room for negotiation.  Baek-Ho sighed again, a sound that must have been echoing through the earth, then nodded.
"Alright, 300 million."
"Oh, it’s 700 million for you and that old geezer."
I pointed at the Baron, and Baek-Ho bristled with outrage. 
“What? Why?”
Does he really not understand?
"It's a huge concession that we're not killing him right here."
"..."
"If you're short on cash, just give up those two.  I'm not compromising on this one."
My words were more of a declaration than a negotiation, and Baek-Ho couldn't find the words to counter. He simply glanced at Erwin, who was standing behind him, then nodded with a forced smile, accepting the inevitable.
“Alright, fine. That’s 2 billion stones.”
“Then that’s settled.”
“Old man! I’ll pay half, you pay the other half! We can do that, right?”
“What rights does a member of a team led by a loser have? Do as you please.”
“Ugh, why do I even bother with this?”
Baek-Ho, the leader who showed no intention of taking responsibility for the situation. His interactions with the Baron were appalling, but the ‘real’ show was yet to come.
"Wait, so we just let you guys off scot-free?"
"..."
“Wh, what do you mean, Baek-Ho?”
Aures, who had sacrificed an arm for Baek-Ho, challenged him with a voice filled with betrayal. But Baek-Ho’s audacity was unmatched.
"What else? Should I pay? You're all adults, right? You're responsible for your own lives."
"..."
"Huh? If you're smart, think about it. I’m in a position to just abandon you all and run right now, you know?"
"..."
Even I was speechless at his miraculous logic. I can’t even imagine what Jeina and Aures must be feeling with someone like that as their leader.
But perhaps they were used to it.
“…Fine. We'll take what we can get. I’ll pay my own.  I'd rather not owe this guy anything.”
“…I, I’ll pay my own as well.”
They simply accepted, resignation etched on their faces.  After settling the internal disagreements, the actual settlement with me began.  During this process, both Bersil and the GM proved quite helpful.
"No way, 20 million for an Ogre leather armor? You could sell it for 40 million at the auction house!”
"I've calculated the auction fees and the cost of waiting for it to be sold."
"What? Are you kidding? How much is the ‘waiting for it to be sold’ fee?!"
Bersil and the GM were relentlessly haggling over the price of the items, and whenever Baek-Ho protested, they’d immediately call me over.
“Uh… Baron?”
“Baron, good to see you.  You also think that price is outrageous, right?  An Ogre leather armor can’t possibly be worth—"
“If you don't like the price, you can sell it later. Pay in cash today.”
"..."
“If you can’t afford cash, just shut up.”
"Ah, I guess that’s why he only offered 100 million when I initially asked for 200 million…"
Baek-Ho finally understood why I hadn’t raised the price further, grumbling to himself.  But once he realized that the haggling was included in the price, he stopped complaining. 
‘…This is insane.’
After settling the payment, we tallied up the final figures. ‘700 million stones in cash.’ More cash than expected.
Knowing that items would be undervalued, they had pulled all their resources to pay in cash… ‘400 million stones in monster byproducts.’
The byproducts would be worth twice as much if sold individually at market value. 
Of course, the real income would be something else. ‘900 million stones in equipment.’
While I couldn't haggle as much on the equipment as I could on byproducts… well, this is how the world works.
There are some rare pieces of equipment that money can’t buy.
‘No. 696 Rainless Emperor’s Bow.’ This one goes to Erwen, who’s been using a random bow after returning the ‘Divine Wood Bow’ to the Elves.
‘No. 989 Circulating Jewel.’ This one is for Bersil. It significantly increases resource recovery speed while not injured, perfect for a mage. 
Actually, it’s most effective when worn by a priest, but we don’t have one in the clan.  I’ll just give it to her when we recruit one.
‘No. 1001 Alonso’s Travel Bag.’ This one was unexpected. It’s a lower number than the previous equipment, but it’s arguably rarer.
“A bag? It’s the size of a belt buckle. An extra-dimensional bag?”
"No, this is a charm-type item."
It’s a bag-shaped piece of equipment, so it’s easy to get confused, but Alonso’s Travel Bag is a charm.  Or rather, in-game, it’s labeled as ‘Charm’, the English name for that type of equipment.
“So, a charm… like No. 9999 Beginner's Luck?”
“Right.”
By the way, the only one in our clan who owns a charm-type item is Ainar.
It’s a charm that increases the chance of obtaining essence from the first monster you hunt, but it’s a bound item.  It can’t be removed or replaced with anything else, unlike No. 1001 Alonso’s Travel Bag.
“So, what does this do? To be honest, I have no idea….”
Amelia answered Bersil’s question.
"I think it increases the chance of not being attacked by monsters and gives you additional stones when a monster dies within its radius.”
The girl is a whiz when it comes to items.  She’s like those kids who can rattle off dinosaur names, even the ones that are hard to pronounce.
But, as an expert on [Dungeon & Stone]… ‘It’s not so much about lowering the chance of being attacked, it’s about lowering your threat level.’
So, as a tank, I can’t wear it.  The threat level reduction isn't fixed, it’s a percentage.
‘It lowered the threat level by 40% or so, if I recall correctly.’
Anyway, this is a good item to have on the team.
Threat level aside, from now on, I’ll get extra stones whenever we kill a monster in the labyrinth.  
‘It’s like a permanent 1.5x increase in stone earnings.’  
I’ll have to think about who to give it to, but for now, Auyen, our weakest member, needs it the most.
“Alright, that’s it, right?  We're done with today's incident?  No hard feelings?”
“Of course not.”
“Ugh…  I wonder how this all happened…  So, we're leaving now?”
“Hold on, where are you going?”
I grabbed him as he tried to make a hasty retreat after the settlement.  Baek-Ho looked at me, confused.
“Why? Aren’t we done here?”
“I can still ask questions, right?”
“I don’t know. We were supposed to fix the portal and go back to the city. But what’s the point? It's not like we can do anything else.”
Technically, if we went ahead with our 'original plan', that old geezer would probably try to 'dispose' of him. But that’s beside the point. 
“So, where are you going?”
“Anywhere. It's not like we can just hang out here and laugh with you, right?”
Actually, I had considered it.  You know,
[An Evil Spirit from another world '————' lost three comrades and finally realized his true path.]
If I brought these guys with me, I might be able to sacrifice them as offerings.  But…
“Don't bother.  It’s not like I’ll ever do anything but fight with you.”
It’s not like that arrogant bastard would ever consider hanging out with me, and… 
‘Ok,  I give up. It’s not going to happen.’
I never thought it would work in the first place.  I’d never consider these guys ‘real’ comrades, and…
If I ever did consider them true comrades, it would be meaningless.
“Hmph! We're out of here.”
Baek-Ho spat, then left with his comrades. 
And…….
