## The Recluse (2)
Yurben Havelion, the mage, a master of arcane engineering, revered by countless magical artificers within his school. Beads of sweat formed on his brow, a testament to the complexity of his task. Interfering with the laws of the spirit world was no easy feat. 
“Damn it,” he muttered, eyes fixed on the gem resting upon his workbench. The gem, a gift from an old man he met shortly after arriving in this world, was, for all intents and purposes, the server and system of the spirit world, which he now called "Ghostbusters." 
“What the hell is wrong?”  
Within this seemingly insignificant gem, countless magical circuits intertwined, both large and small. He had spent years analyzing and modifying them, building the Ghostbusters we know today. But… 
“…Is this approach truly impossible?”
Havelion sighed, defeated, after hours of pouring magic into the gem, attempting to rectify the circuits.  It was almost laughable to be disappointed.  He had been trying for decades; it wasn’t going to happen overnight. His most recent achievement, and perhaps the only one worth mentioning, was an update allowing him to discreetly check the usernames of players who joined the anonymous chat room using his administrative privileges. 
His personal communicator buzzed.  He didn’t even need to look to know who it was. 
“Yes, Soul Queen. Any issues concerning me?”
[No… There's nothing about Havelion being discussed anywhere.]
“…I see.”
He felt a mixture of frustration and relief. His identity, carefully concealed for nearly two decades, had been exposed in the most unexpected of places. 
“Keep an eye on that. We need to address this kind of rumor before it spreads. I'll keep looking for ways to identify other members.” 
[Yes. And… I'm sorry.]
“….”
He remained silent, unable to utter any words of reassurance.  He couldn’t even offer a hollow apology.
“Then… Contact me again if anything comes up.”
[Yes, get some rest.]
After ending the call, he returned to his workbench. 
‘If I just modify the circuits to store their location at the moment of connection, I might be able to trace them…'
He meticulously studied the intricate internal workings of the gem. As always, the answer would lie within this stone.
***
A knock at the door made him jump to his feet.
‘…Who is it?’
He couldn't tell.  Erwen wouldn't knock, so it had to be an outsider…
An outsider knocking on the front door, not even the main gate? 
‘Damn it.’
He held his breath, lowered his body, and stealthily approached the door.  Just then…
Click, click.
He heard the distinct sound of the door handle rattling, followed by the unlocking mechanism. 
Creak.
The door slowly swung open.  Ready to subdue the intruder, fist clenched, I froze upon seeing their face.
“…Thank goodness you were here.”
“Amelia…!”
“Ugh… Don’t… Don’t just charge in like that!”
I was just happy to see her. 
“…Come in.”
“Excuse me… ”
Amelia seemed to dislike a reunion hug, so I skipped it and quickly ushered her inside.  I had countless questions.  But I decided to start from the beginning.
“How did you find me here?”
“…I waited in front of the bank and saw the fairy, so I followed her.”
“Huh?  But why now…?”
“There was no opportunity to approach.”
Huh?
She always claimed to be busy at the sanctuary, but she’d been hanging around my house all this time?
I told her, and she shook her head.
“That’s impossible.  The woman was always near my home.”
A shiver ran down my spine.
“…So… she never went to the sanctuary all this time?”
“You… you didn’t know?”
“….”
“Lately, though, she’s been acting differently, going somewhere else.  I thought it might be a trap, so I spent a few days observing, which is why I’m late.”
That reassured me a bit. If there was a change in behavior, it likely had to do with the conversation we’d had.
“So… what happened with Blood Queen?  It must’ve been hard for her to accept you being alive. The whole demon issue too.”
“Ah, that’s settled.”
I gave her a brief summary, focusing on the important details of what happened with Erwen. 
Amelia looked somewhat surprised.
“She doesn’t care if you’re a demon or not…  That’s not like the adventurer I knew.”
“She’s acting kind of strange. If this had been the old Erwen, she wouldn’t think like that.”
“I don’t think so.”
“Huh?”
“She’s the one who refused to stop trying to avenge you even after the demon announcement.  She’d already made up her mind in her heart. She doesn’t care who you are.”
Well, that’s possible.
“Anyway, I still made sure she knew you’re not a demon.  You never know what might happen later.”
Amelia chuckled.
“So… I’m the only one in this world who knows your true identity?”
“No, there’s one more.”
“…You said Misha Karlstain doesn’t know you’re a demon.”
“It’s someone else. Not a local.  He’s from my hometown.”
There was no need to hide, and he could very well become a variable later, so I told her about Baekho. 
However, her reaction was strange.
“Baekho…? He’s from your hometown?”
She seemed to know the name.  Come to think of it, a lot of people at the Round Table knew about him. 
I’d planned to casually ask Erwen about it later, but I thought it would be better to get information from Amelia first.
“Do you know him?”
“…Yes, I do.”
“Well, you did come over here much earlier than I did, so you might have heard of him.  But how long have you been back?”
“Two years ago.”
“Oh, so you’ve experienced time here at a 1:1 rate—”
“But that doesn’t matter. I knew Baekho long before that.”
Huh?
She knew Baekho from before?
I stared at her, wanting a more detailed explanation, and Amelia finally spoke.
“Do you remember me telling you I was on a team with a demon for over a year?”
Uh…
“That demon was Baekho.”
What the hell, this guy. 
He’s involved in everything.
***
Amelia met Baekho about five years ago. 
She was sent by the Lord to intentionally approach him.  At the time, there were suspicions that he might be a demon, which they were tasked to verify. If he was a demon, they might be able to persuade him.
“Adventurers who could use Aura were rare, so it wasn’t hard to join his team. I spent about a year with him.”
According to Amelia, that was when she obtained [Self-Duplication] in the Doppelganger Forest and cleared the White Shrine on the 3rd floor.
Wow, no wonder she knew about all the hidden things.
If she was on a team with Baekho, it would make sense.
“So?  What happened then?”
“Nothing much. After a year, the Lord lost interest when we didn’t find any solid clues.  I was given a different mission and left his team under false pretenses.  And… I later heard that he was exposed.”
“Exposed?”
“I don’t know the details. The royal family kept the whole incident under wraps.  All I knew from my investigation was that he was betrayed by a teammate, his identity was revealed, and many people died in the labyrinth that day.”
Amelia later learned that the royal family had discarded all records of Baekho and controlled information for years, ensuring he was forgotten in the city.
One question still remained.
“But how did you find out the name Baekho?”
“That happened more recently. I don’t know if he had a falling out with the royal family, but he’s been showing up everywhere and introducing himself as Baekho.  Oh, by the way, he used to use aliases, or people referred to him simply as ‘that one.’”
I see…
I never expected to meet someone who knew about Baekho’s past, let alone someone close to me.
“What was he like back then?”
“Well, I wasn’t close to him.  I didn’t like his flippant behavior.  But everyone else was incredibly close, except for me.”
“Incredibly close?”
“Yes, like the teams you create.”
I listened to her stories about Baekho, feeling a sense of unease with every detail.
“What?  His team is all women? And he’s dating all of them?  Damn, this guy built a harem in the labyrinth… ”
“Harem? I don’t know what that is, but your team is all women too.”
What is she saying?
Bearman is holding down the fort, you know.
And when my team was still half-formed, everyone was a guy except Misha.
“Well, let’s just say it’s similar.”
“No, it’s the truth.  I just pick people based on their abilities and skills, and before I knew it, it happened.  It has nothing to do with romantic interests—”
“No need to explain.  I don’t care.”
“…?”
“We’re from different countries, right?  I don’t know much about Korea, but I guess that part of your culture was similar to the noble culture here.”
No, Korea is a monogamous country, you know.
What the hell does she think Korea is?
I feel like me and Baekho have seriously damaged Korea’s reputation.  But I decided not to argue any further. It wasn’t important.
I’d heard enough stories, so it was time to move on.
“Amelia.  What was the message you left at the bank?”
“…What do you mean? I wrote exactly what I meant.”
“Ah, the letter Erwen gave me was torn.  I only read as far as ‘The Devil Crusher is… ’ and couldn’t read the rest.”
“…Oh, I see.”
Amelia seemed noticeably flustered when the conversation turned to my precious hammer.
“I wondered why you didn’t mention it…  Did you really not read the rest?”
“No, I’m asking because I’m starting to get anxious.  Tell me. What happened to my hammer? Is it safe—?”
“The hammer is safe.”
Amelia cut me off, her voice firm.
And…
Swish.
She avoided my gaze, speaking softly.
“It’s in the vault of the Alminous Trading Post’s Collateral Loan Department… ”
Ugh.
***
A heavy silence descended upon Amelia and me. 
Amelia, always so confident, couldn’t meet my eyes, seemingly aware of her wrongdoing.  I was the first to break the silence.
“…Why did you sell it?”
There had to be a reason.  I mean, it wasn’t just anyone; it was Amelia.
“Correction.”
“…Huh?”
“I didn’t sell it.  I took out a loan using it as collateral.”
What the hell, that’s not even a real reason!
I glared at her, and Amelia coughed.
“But we need to be precise about these things to avoid problems later—”
“Enough with that. Answer my question. Why did you sell my… why did you use my hammer as collateral?  Why?”
“…To protect you when you came back.”
Ugh, I knew it.  There had to be a valid reason for doing something so drastic—
“…I bought a new essence at the auction house.”
“…What?!”
Finally regaining my composure, I blurted out a response.  Amelia hurriedly continued.
“Don’t worry.  You can get it back as long as you repay the loan before the due date.”
That eased my mind a little.  Well, if she needed money, that’s possible.  It seems likely she used that money to buy the Twin Hydra’s [Double Rule]. If I could buy it with money, it’s a good essence worthy of purchasing.
But I needed to check a few things.
“…When’s the due date?”
“Two months from now.”
“…How much do I owe?”
“I don’t have it right now.”
“Then what’s your plan for getting the money?”
“…I had one.”
Yes, past tense.
Another quest was added to my already busy schedule.
