## The Comeback (1)
Ihan-su’s room felt familiar yet strange.  "It's been a while," he thought. After a brief glance around to see if anything had changed, he quickly switched on his computer, his toes wiggling in anticipation. 
"Ziiiiing-!" 
His goal for today was simple: information gathering, his top priority as always. The only difference was that this time, there was a backlog of two years and six months worth of content. "Let’s check the forums first," he decided. 
The Round Table, the main dish of community activity, wouldn't open for another three hours. With that in mind, he clicked through the various forums, adjusting his mouse with practiced ease.  It was a tedious task, requiring him to scroll through a long list to see the current atmosphere in chronological order. 
[Wow, has anyone been to Bjorn Yandel's house?]
- I went with some people who'd helped him out on the first floor, and it felt weird seeing all those flowers. 
- It really does feel like he's gone. 
- His companions were totally in mourning. 
Well, there were plenty of posts about me, so I can start reading here.
[tetyys: What's all the fuss over a dead NPC?]
[ㄴSogeking33: Right, like anyone would care if someone like you, a little punk, died, right?]
[ㄴSoDamnToxic: The barbarian tribe chief candidate, a nobleman with a title from explorer origins, who appeared after ten years, even the royal family sent a knight order to honor the hero's death with a funeral procession. … It’s natural for inferior beings to cling to him, right?]
[Ki11Humans77: Too bad. I was curious how his new clan would grow.]
I skimmed the first few comments, then hit the back button, carefully browsing through the posts one by one.
One month, two months, three months…
As time passed, the forum reflected the hottest topics of the day. The sheer volume of posts about my death was a testament to that.  
Just one month later, the mention of me had drastically reduced, almost completely disappearing. 
However, the following month, they started to appear again. Someone had thrown more fuel on the fire. 
[Is it true that Bjorn Yandel is a phantom?]
-  I hear it everywhere I go.  This wouldn’t be happening over nothing. 
[Bjorn Yandel is a phantom: Three reasons.]
-  Hey, if you like it, click the recommend button!
[It’s common sense, right? How can he be a phantom?]
-  Anyone who says he is a phantom has never seen Bjorn Yandel, they're just a newbie.
-  Anyone who agrees, will have a beastkin girlfriend.
[arolf5205: That guy’s right. Anyone who says Bjorn Yandel is a phantom is probably a newbie.]
[1spring: Bjorn Yandel is not a phantom. So, am I going to have a beastkin girlfriend now?]
[Bling0_0: Well, I still think he might be a phantom….]
Two months after Bjorn Yandel’s (supposed) death, the forum was flooded with discussions about whether I was a phantom or not. 
Most still considered it a rumor. 
Well, there was one comment that caught my attention. 
[teckmonkey:  Maybe it’s not a rumor, but the truth.  There’s talk that the first place that rumor came from is someone Bjorn Yandel trusted most.]
It only said “companion” without specifying who it was, so I ignored it. It's common for all sorts of trolls to jump in when a hot topic comes up. 
Click, click. 
Three months after my death, the buzz faded, and my name was rarely mentioned. 
However… 
Six months after my death, my name exploded onto the forum. The royal family made it official. 
Bjorn Yandel, they declared, was a phantom. 
[Hey, is the official document posted by the royal family real?]
[Bjorn Yandel is a phantom?]
[He was a tribe chief candidate and even received a noble title. How can he be a phantom? Isn’t this a mistake?]
Everyone seemed confused at first, but gradually, evidence of my phantom status emerged, and the community came to accept it as fact. 
Thinking about it, assuming I was a phantom, there were quite a few things that didn't make sense. 
[Thinking about it, it’s weird.]
- For starters, how did he grow that fast in such a short time? It’s too strange to just see him as a prodigy. 
[ㄴtunaboot:  Fact 1: It doesn't make sense even if he's a phantom.]
[ㄴBrutalizerX: Fact 2: Bjorn Yandel was living with three women.]
[ㄴWingPizza: Fact 3: Bjorn Yandel is known for his height. It’s over 20cm.  Of course, I mean his height.]
Of course, my name wasn't a hot topic for long. 
While it was a shocking story, there wasn't enough fuel to keep it going. 
Bjorn Yandel is a phantom?
What a surprise. 
So what?  How long are you going to talk about the dead guy? 
That was the general sentiment. 
Of course, some people did speculate about the rumors surrounding his sudden death, or why the royal family had chosen to confirm those rumors now. Some thought there was some bigger secret behind it…
However…
That was all. 
There was no way such a secret would be circulating on the community's free forum. 
Click, click. 
I continued to read, but there were no big topics that would spark the entire forum for months. 
It was just a bunch of random people posting whatever they wanted, with an ordinary, chaotic vibe. 
However…
One year after my death. 
One event sparked the entire community. 
[Hey guys, have you heard about the Nartel clan?]
The Nartel clan. 
The clan led by Melter Pend, an explorer who'd been closely connected to me during the Noark war. 
Ninety percent of the clan had died in the labyrinth. 
The cause was already common knowledge. 
[godFLEXyou: Yeah, they said Noark got them and only a few survived.] 
The Noark, who were supposed to be outside the wall, were found in the labyrinth. 
All sorts of theories began circulating in the community. 
There was talk of portals outside the wall. 
Or perhaps they'd created a new portal somehow. Some even claimed that the Noark might be among us, disguised and hiding in the city. 
And…
One year and one month after my death.
A mid-sized clan was wiped out in the labyrinth. 
They were a clan active in the Dark Continent, the same place where the Nartel clan met their demise. 
There were no survivors, so the cause of their extinction remained unknown. 
One year and three months after my death.
Clans started disappearing without a trace from the seventh floor, and there were numerous sightings of people who claimed to have seen the Noark. 
Most of these sightings were on the seventh floor. 
One year and four months after my death.
The royal family acknowledged the seriousness of the incident,  once again distributing status cards. 
They even sent knights to patrol the lower floors of the labyrinth. 
But nothing changed. 
Even though they inspected everyone entering from the first floor as soon as the labyrinth opened, there was no sign of the Noark. 
One year and six months after my death. 
The royal family, noticing that the Noark were only appearing on the seventh floor, formed an expedition team with the help of some large clans. 
They returned after suffering heavy casualties. 
However, they did make some progress. 
[Breaking News:  Latest Noark Update.]
-  We got confirmed information by interrogating prisoners captured during the expedition.
-  The Noark bastards opened a portal outside the wall, and if you enter through it, you land straight on the seventh floor.
-  Of course, the prisoners don't know how they did it, and the royal family is clueless as well. 
New information had been confirmed. 
Time continued to pass, and one year and eight months after my death… 
The royal family banned ordinary explorers from entering the Dark Continent and organized a second expedition team. After pouring countless resources into it, they managed to win a hard-fought victory in a single battle. 
And… 
[This is it, real war.] 
The battle for control of the seventh floor officially began. 
They believed that if the Noark gained power by hiding on the seventh floor, it would cause major problems in the future. 
Enticed by the royal family's substantial rewards, countless explorers joined the war, and heroes who made their names in this war emerged daily. 
The Seven Pillars were a prime example. 
They were seven young heroes who were previously unknown but gained fame through their exploits in this war. 
[Looking at it now, it seems like Bjorn Yandel’s party had a crazy talent pool. How can one party produce two members of the Seven Pillars?]
I finally finished browsing the posts, including those uploaded ten minutes ago. It had been a long two years and six months, and even with just a quick skim, I had already spent over two hours checking them. 
"Time to take a break and organize things…," I thought, getting off the chair and lying on the bed. 
I had learned very little from browsing the community. It was no surprise. 
I'd been home for over ten days, listening to Erwen tell me all sorts of stories. I already knew about the major events, categorized by timeline. 
Of course, that included the Noark incident. 
"But, it was good to look around and get a sense of the atmosphere back then…," I thought. 
Moreover, there was a lot of information in the posts that Erwen hadn’t told me. 
For example, there was news that all the explorers who had been in a coma after being struck by the pillar of fire had recovered. 
“Well, anyway, I should check out the Marketplace now,” I thought. 
After a short break, I sat back in front of my computer and started going through the backlog of posts. 
And time flew by… 
[03:09]
It was time to enter the Round Table. 
***
"Creeek." 
The goblin wearing a mask opened the door and greeted me with a bright smile. 
"Oh, Fox! Long time no see!"
"Yes, hello." 
“You’re the first two here again today, aren’t you?” 
The goblin asked, but the woman wearing a fox mask, Bersil Goulard, just laughed awkwardly.  It was obvious this wasn’t a question to confirm a fact, but a way to start a personal conversation. 
She didn't have anything to talk about with the goblin. 
“…Haha, you must have something on your mind again today, like last time?  I’ll stay quiet.”
"Thanks." 
As soon as she said that, the Stag Antlers and the Crescent Moon arrived, almost simultaneously. 
I checked the time: 3:05.  Five minutes left. 
“The other two haven’t shown up yet, have they?”
“….They’ll be here soon.” 
She answered the Stag Antlers’ question with a bitter laugh. The two members who hadn't yet joined were the Jester and the Queen. 
They'd probably come today. 
They'd probably just show up, confirm the members, and leave before the meeting starts. 
Like they've been doing for the past year. 
"Well, at least we have four, so we can have a proper meeting today."
“…Last time, Stag Antlers was missing, and we couldn’t even start the meeting. Why weren’t you here?” 
“Goblin, must I explain such things to you?”
“That… no. I was just curious and asked.” 
Just as we were exchanging meaningless small talk before the meeting started, the door opened again. 
The new arrival was a woman. 
"Oh, wow, long time no see, everyone!"
The Queen. 
She didn't have the presence of the Lion, but she more than made up for it with her information gathering skills, proving her worth in this meeting.  
"Are you going to wait again and then leave?"
The Crescent Moon asked politely, and the Queen laughed awkwardly. That was enough of an answer. 
Everyone knew what she was thinking. 
‘I guess there’s not much point in participating in this meeting without the Lion.’
Even after the Lion stopped coming, she continued to attend meetings and share information. 
But at some point, she, and the Jester as well, started leaving before the meeting began, after just checking the members. 
“Pfft, you were all here together again?” 
“Jester….”
With two minutes to go until the meeting started, all eyes turned to the Jester as he arrived. 
Most of them were not friendly. 
After all, they'd been clashing with the Noark a lot lately. 
They weren't as hostile as the Crescent Moon, but they couldn't be friendly with him, a figure from the Noark faction. 
"Are you going to keep staring at me until I die?"
The Jester didn't seem to care about their hostile stares, finding an empty seat and sitting down. He looked at the clock on the wall, impatiently waiting for someone. 
It was a familiar scene. 
"Ugh, is he not going to come again today?"
“……I hear there have been sightings of the Noark trying to sneak up to the sixth floor lately.  What’s the reason?”
“What? The meeting hasn’t even started.  Why would I tell you that?”
“That’s because… you aren’t participating in the meeting…”
“Stag Antlers, really…  You should’ve brought something more interesting. It’s just not fun, so I always come and then leave. I’m not here for entertainment, you know.”
“….Do you think that will make you look like the Lion?” 
“Pfft, that wasn’t my intention, but…”
The Jester chuckled and stood up, and the Queen followed suit, as if she’d been waiting. 
“Anyway, it doesn't seem like he's coming today, so I’m going to go.”
“I’ll go too….” 
The Fox watched them leave and sighed quietly. She felt a pang of sadness at their absence, and it made her realize how much she needed someone. 
‘Ugh, where did the Lion disappear to?’
At first, the Jester and the Queen were both quick to speculate on his disappearance. 
He’s lost interest. 
The GM expelled him from the community. 
There were many other theories, but the one that stuck with her was the goblin's speculation. 
Maybe he was Bjorn Yandel? 
It was a coincidence that he died around the same time that the Lion disappeared. 
But…
[Pfft, Goblin, why don’t you quit being a knight and become a writer instead?]
The goblin was ridiculed after sharing his theory. 
He hadn't been mean, but none of the other members took it seriously, for the same reason. 
The Lion first appeared on the Round Table, and at that time, Bjorn Yandel was just a newbie explorer, not even a year in. 
There was no way someone who was barely active on the third or fourth floor could put on such a show. 
However…
‘Maybe that theory was true….’ 
The Fox thought that the theory could be true. 
It had a lot of contradictions, but if that were the case, at least it would explain why the Lion hasn't shown up in two and a half years—
"Creeeeek."
Suddenly, the door that had been firmly closed slowly creaked open, and everyone flinched. 
It was a simple reason. 
The Jester, who was about to leave, hadn't even reached the door yet. 
“……?”
No one else should be coming. 
No, no one else could be coming. 
Except one person. 
“Thud.” 
A man appeared from behind the door. 
And…
“……!”
“……!”
The man, who had frozen everyone in place simply by appearing, spoke, as if he had just stopped by because he was bored on his way somewhere. 
“Long time no see.” 
The Lion was back.
