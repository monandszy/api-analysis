## Chapter 679: Dream (6)
My escape plan, scheduled for the next day, was thwarted. There was no longer any reason for me to escape. After Auril Gaviss departed, all the discharge procedures proceeded smoothly.
"In my opinion, he's fit to return to society," the doctor declared, deeming me fully recovered.
"Congratulations on your discharge, Hansu," said Team Leader Kang, who had brought news from the police.
Of course, Hyeonbyeol and my mother showed signs of bewilderment at this sudden turn of events.
"That's great, oppa," Hyeonbyeol chirped, her voice laced with genuine joy. "Really, that's fantastic."
"Let's go home… home, Hansu," my mother whispered, her voice thick with emotion.
Ultimately, both of them were happy for me.
And so, my hospital discharge was completed within a day. Finally freed from the confines of the hospital, I headed back to my room, accompanied by my mother.
"I stopped by earlier to tidy up a bit," she explained, her voice laced with a tinge of guilt. "It's messy, isn't it? If I knew you'd be discharged so soon, I would've finished everything beforehand."
"You're not leaving?" I asked, my voice laced with a subtle note of surprise.
"I'll stay here for a while to help you… if it's inconvenient, I can just come and go without actually sleeping here."
"Ha… that's fine," I replied, my tone flat and indifferent. "It's over two hours away, so why bother coming back and forth? Just stay here."
It was just a temporary world, a world I would eventually leave. I decided it was more troublesome to try and kick her out, so I started living with my mother.
Having her around was quite convenient.
"Hansu, dinner's ready…"
My meals were prepared on time.
"…" I mused. "How long has it been since I've had a proper meal?"
The food was to my liking.
"I'm thinking of buying a new laptop."
"Use my card, honey," my mother said, her voice warm and reassuring.
I could even copy money from her card. Not that I felt comfortable doing so.
"No, not the card. I was wondering if you could drive me to the electronics store."
In any case, after finishing up with the house, I immediately headed to the electronics store to buy laptops. Five of them, all the cheapest models available.
"Hansu, is there a reason to buy this many laptops?" my mother inquired, her brow furrowed in confusion.
"Yes. The game I'm playing requires at least five laptops," I replied, my tone matter-of-fact.
"Oh, is that right?" she asked, still unsure but accepting my answer.
My mother didn't understand, but she had never played this game. The core of [Dungeon and Stone] was luck and grinding. You need to constantly retry, and with just one computer, how long would it take to finish?
"If I use a tool to run four instances on each laptop, I can simultaneously level up twenty characters."
I had actually played this way for nine years in the past. The game didn't require precise control, except for a few situations. It's about leveling up multiple characters until a specific soul crystal or equipment drops. If I see a chance to clear the game, I focus on managing those specific characters.
"Okay, setting is complete."
I set all twenty characters as barbarians and began playing in earnest.
Click, click, click.
Tap, tap, tap, tap.
Thump! Thump! Thump! Thwack!
The first floor was a busy zone, as automation was difficult, but I used the ESC key to adjust the tempo and keep up.
"Character has recruited a warrior as a companion."
"Character has recruited an archer as a companion."
"Character has recruited an archer as a companion."
"Character has recruited a warrior as a companion…"
After the first return, I recruited companions one by one from the Explorer's Guild, which made things a little easier. Though, I still had to constantly monitor them.
"Warriors and archers are the best for the early levels, no doubt about it."
Was it because I hadn't played in a long time?  Even grinding through the tedious early levels was enjoyable.
Of course, these moments of joy didn't last long.
"Character has died after stepping on a trap."
"Game Over."
As I progressed beyond the third floor, I started losing characters one by one.  I played hardcore, letting the characters die when they were supposed to die. 
"A blow I can't withstand!"
"Character has died."
There was no point in feeling sorry. This game was impossible to clear by growing characters slowly and safely.
Survival of the fittest.  No, even that wasn't enough.  It was more like, "The pain that doesn't kill you makes you stronger."  Characters that survived in a "lucky" way, in places where everyone else would die, grow stronger.
"A fatal blow!"
"Character has died."
"Character has died in a raid by looters."
"Game Over."
"Character has died by a troll."
"Game Over."
Faster than any other character.
***
"Character's soul is infused with [Troll Soul]."
"Character has entered the fifth floor, Great Devil's Realm."
"New equipment has been equipped."
"Character's total item level increased by +799…"
***
One week, two weeks, three weeks… Time flew by since I settled into this house.
"Hansu! Come eat!"
My mother tirelessly cared for me, a gamer who spent all his time indoors.
"Oppa, what is this? It doesn't look like a monster."
"It's a person. I'm trying to level up this character by looting," I explained.
"Wow, that's brutal," Hyeonbyeol replied, her voice laced with amusement.
Hyeonbyeol visited occasionally, sitting on my bed, watching me play.  She'd talk about the game with me, like a class president tasked with helping a student struggling to fit in.
"Oppa, I'll be going now! I have to work tomorrow. Goodbye, Mother!"
"Okay, Hyeonbyeol! Be careful!"
Gradually, my daily routine with my mother became familiar. At first, I felt awkward with her around, even when changing clothes, so I would always lock my door and take all my clothes, including underwear, when going to the bathroom. But now...
"What's the point? I'll be leaving anyway," I reasoned.
I now live here comfortably, without a single worry.
However, spending all my days and nights just playing games inevitably led to all sorts of thoughts.  For instance, I suddenly felt a sense of existential dread. 
"Despite your words, you seem to have grown quite fond of this place."
The old man's words kept replaying in my mind.  I tried to stop questioning everything, but the doubts kept swirling in my head.
"Is it really... a dream?"
Was the witch who told me not to return a mere figment of my imagination, based on my subconscious? 
I'm tired of agonizing over it, but I can't help but keep thinking. So I decided to organize my thoughts.
"Hansu, whether you believe it or not, this is reality.  It may be different from where you were, but it's real."
Auril Gaviss said this place is a parallel world.
"There is no such thing as a 'cheat mode' in this world."
There was no cheat mode, and thus, there was only one world where I was dragged to Rafdonia.
"If you want to go back to that place, I have no reason to persuade you."
Auril Gaviss wants me to go back to Rafdonia.
"I wish it were so."
The only way to go back is to wish for it with all my heart.
That's why I'm a recluse, spending every day grinding in this game, trying to clear it.
"You may not be able to come back."
"Are you sure you want to enter?"
Looking at these words again.
If I could press "Yes" once more, my desire and will would be proven.
"Perhaps... this really is another reality."
I no longer take those mind-numbing drugs, but that makes me even more confused.  The evidence seems clearer, if anything. 
If this isn't a dream world... 
Gulp, gulp. 
The taste of this warm home-cooked meal, devoured like a cow chewing on hay, also makes sense.
Tick. 
The number of X marks on my calendar has surpassed sixty. I've never seen a "Dreamfall Waterfall" dream last this long. 
The motivation also makes sense.
"You mustn't open the Gate of the Abyss."
If the witch of the earth told me that, maybe she wanted to send me to another world, fearing I might open the Gate of the Abyss one day.
And not only that…
"The discrepancies I perceived as dreams now all make sense."
I'm not talking about the kindness of Hyeonbyeol and my mother.  The police station and the hospital, everything felt artificial.  Unrealistic, you might say.  It had that feeling, in a nutshell.
But…
"Auril Gaviss."
If that old man was involved, even that makes sense.  It was that old man who made ordinary people react to magic the way magicians would. 
Maybe he was working behind the scenes, influencing things, or casting magic to brainwash me and make things easier for me. Like when the doctor suddenly declared me fully recovered. 
"If I believe this is a dream world, that would be a win-win for the old man."
Of course, I'm just clearing my head with these thoughts during my free time. My goal hasn't changed. 
Even if an enormous force intervened and brought me to the "reality" of a parallel world… what then?
Nothing changes.
No, actually, things have become clearer. My friends and companions are all there. I will live there. Maybe I'll even have a family there someday.
Yes, so…
Tap, tap, tap, tap.
Click, click, click.
I move my mouse and tap the keyboard, eager to return to my place, as soon as possible.
"Character has died."
"Game Over."
Die.
"Character has died."
"Game Over."
Die again.
"Character has died."
"Game Over."
I overcome the endless misfortune brought on by [Dungeon and Stone].
"Character has died."
"Game Over."
I leverage all my knowledge to reach higher floors.
"Character has died."
"Game Over."
Of course, it wasn't stress-free.
"AAAAAAARGH! Why are you healing him there?!"
I scream at the top of my lungs, my well-raised party wiped out, leaving my room empty.
"Whew..."
I'm obsessed with this game, except for when I'm sleeping, so it's hard to keep my sanity. I even crack open a beer.
"Hansu, maybe you should take a break from that game…"
"There's a person inside it!"
It was clear my mother and Hyeonbyeol were exhausted from watching me like this.
"Mother…  I don't think this is sustainable."
"But you're the one who said that if you clear this game without anything happening, you'll regain your sanity."
"Yes, I did. But I feel like I'm getting worse day by day…  Should I go to the hospital and get some medication?"
"I'm sorry, Hyeonbyeol…  It's all my fault…"
"No, Mother. I'll help you."
I opened my door to go to the bathroom, but the conversation I heard from the living room made me feel like a true golden child…
But nothing changed.
Clench.
I'll just do my own thing.
Like a barbarian.
"Character has died."
"Game Over."
"Character has entered the seventh floor, Dark Continent."
"Character has died."
"Game Over."
"Character has entered the eighth floor, Land of Dawn."
"Character has died."
"Game Over."
"Character has entered the ninth floor, Stargraveyard."
"Character has died."
"Game Over."
"Character has entered the tenth floor…"
…
"Gate of the Abyss."
"Are you sure you want to enter?"
"I'm HERE! I'M HERE!!!"
I shout in front of my monitor. Hyeonbyeol, lying on the bed reading, frowns and walks towards me.
"…Why are you shouting all of a sudden?"
"I've arrived! I've ARRIVED!!!"
"…" Hyeonbyeol looks at me with a strange expression. "Are you awake?"
I nod slightly, and Hyeonbyeol's expression becomes even more complex.
"It's been a while since I've seen you so excited," she said softly.
"Of course I'm excited, aren't I? I've wasted months being trapped in this room!"
Hyeonbyeol doesn't respond to my outburst.
"You're so cruel, Oppa.  To call it a waste."
"…What?"
"From a normal person's perspective, what I did was a waste," Hyeonbyeol says, her usual strong demeanor replaced with a fragile vulnerability.
Well…
"Of course, I never thought of it as a waste," I reply, my voice softening.
I admit that she's helped me in every way imaginable for months. I can't honestly say that I haven't grown fond of her during that time.
"Can't you just… not press it?"
"…What?"
"That 'YES' button. Can't you just… not press it?"
Hyeonbyeol's voice cracks. It seems she’s finally letting in the possibility of me being inside the game, even though she never believed it. 
"Do you… hate us that much?"
Hyeonbyeol is sad.
Sad about my choice itself. 
"Did spending time with us make you so miserable?"
Actually, that's not true.
It was fun and comfortable in its own way.  It was almost like a dream, something I had always wanted.  Or rather…
"It was something I used to want," I say, realizing the truth.
My dreams have already changed. I have something more precious now, something I crave more deeply.  
So…
"You could just start over here…"
"I have to go back," I say firmly, despite the awkwardness.
"…"
A heavy silence descends upon the room.
"Hyeonbyeol, I'm sorry. I promise I'll really, really help you once I get back… okay? I need to go back to get you back from there, remember?"
I force a smile and joke lightly, but Hyeonbyeol sighs. 
"…Ugh, you're so dumb. I don't know, Oppa. Just do what you have to do. I just said not to press it because it was annoying."
Hyeonbyeol then lays down on the bed with a sulky expression and opens a book. I return to my chair and look at my monitor.
And…
Click.
I hesitantly press YES, and another message pops up.
"You may not be able to come back."
"Are you sure you want to enter?"
This is a scene I considered unnecessary for the player.
But something feels off.
"…"
Unlike before, when I clicked without a second thought, my hand hesitates.
"Why? Are you not going to press it? Are you afraid I'll be upset? It's too late for that anyway."
Hyeonbyeol glares at me, her voice full of resentment. 
"What are you two whispering about? Come eat! Dinner's ready!"
The aroma of warm food wafts from the kitchen.
"Despite your words, you seem to have grown quite fond of this place."
I admit that the old man's words were true.
But even so, my hesitation doesn't last long.  The young Hansu who wanted everything in his hands has grown up. 
"You may not be able to come back."
"Are you sure you want to enter?"
Click.
"Yes."
It's time to wake up from this dream.
