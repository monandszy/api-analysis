## Betrayer (2)
The art museum in Sector 4, a place I had visited alone a few times in the past, was abandoned and unguarded after the Noark invasion. A woman was stuffing the paintings hanging on the walls into her subspace.
“Um… Emily?”
“I’m not stealing.”
“…Excuse me?”
“If I leave them here, people who don’t appreciate their value might vandalize them… .”
“Ah, ah… yes… I see.”
“I’m not taking them to hang in my house later. I’ll give them back if someone asks. Understand?”
“…Yes, I understand. But that’s not what I wanted to ask. It’s something else… .”
Amelia cleared her throat, her face flushed, at Auyen’s words.
“…Go on.”
“Well… it’s nothing important… Ah! And I’m not pressuring you! I just… I wanted to know what our plans are… for the future.”
Amelia pondered the question, her chin in her hand. 
And then…
“I’m thinking.”
“…Excuse me?”
“We can manage for now. No need to rush, right? Be patient even if it feels frustrating.”
“No, no! I’m not frustrated at all!”
“Good. Then that’s good.”
Amelia continued wandering through the darkened museum, collecting art pieces in her subspace. Auyen helped her from the side.
And then…
“Aren’t you taking those?”
“Those pieces are trash. The artist was notorious for abusing young girls while he was alive.”
“…Let’s burn them.”
Amelia rested her back against a wall after burning the remaining pieces, using them as kindling. Auyen didn’t bother her anymore.
“…….”
“…….”
Silence followed. 
Time passed, and soon it was dusk. 
Auyen spoke in a subdued tone.
“…I apologize, Emily.”
A question without a subject.
Amelia understood its meaning immediately and chuckled.
“You mean when we got separated?”
“Yes… if I hadn’t fallen behind that day… we wouldn’t have had to be hiding like this.”
The day the main force abandoned them and retreated. 
Auyen, who was at the front line, was hit by a flying arrow during the melee and fell behind. 
Amelia turned back to rescue her immediately. She did manage to save her, but they were separated from the clan members. As they moved, trying to avoid contact with the enemy as much as possible, they ended up here in Sector 4, at the art museum.
“…I apologize. It’s my fault for holding you back… .”
“Don’t apologize.”
“…Excuse me?”
“In that case, you should say thank you.”
Despite saying that, Amelia felt a little ridiculous and chuckled.
‘Thank you, not I’m sorry… .’
It was a line she would never have uttered back when she was filled with nothing but venom. 
Thinking about it, a strange loneliness welled up within her.
It wasn’t just longing for people in general, but a specific emotion directed at a specific person.
‘…I wonder if he’s caused any trouble while I was gone.’
Even as she worried, Amelia realized that this was the feeling of “missing someone.” And this feeling of “missing someone” was different from what she used to feel for her elder sister.
Swoosh.
Instinctively huddled behind the wall where the least amount of light reached, Amelia stood up and walked towards the window.
The spot where the moon’s light shone brightest.
She had never preferred such places.
As the saying goes, childhood habits stick with you.  She felt at ease in the dark and experienced an inexplicable sense of discomfort in the bright spaces.
But…
‘Not bad.’
Amelia murmured quietly, bathed in the warm moonlight.
“Emily Rains.”
A new name she created because she didn’t want to cause any more trouble. 
At first, she was satisfied just being able to live in the light with that name.
Was I this greedy?
“Amelia Rainwales.”
For the first time in a long time, she uttered her real name out loud, thinking.
‘Maybe.’
Maybe it was time to end the life of hiding in the shadows—.
“……?”
When her thoughts reached that point, she sensed an anomaly in her body and quickly activated her ability.
‘Self-Replication.’
The ability she had used like her own body for a long time didn’t activate.
And then…
“…Was it punishment for being greedy?”
She knew the reason all too well.

Betrayer.
The word froze me in place, my ears pricking up. 
An instinctive human need, I suppose, to form a ‘society’.
‘…Anyway, I’m a little too late to give chase now.’
I was going to just drop the pursuit of the corpse collector for now. But I warned her just in case she’d tried something sneaky.
“If you’re lying, it will be quite painful.”
It wasn’t an empty threat, and thankfully, she seemed to understand its sincerity.
“…Of, of course. But it’s true! I’m not lying!”
“Then prove it.”
I didn’t bother with idle chatter and went straight to the point. Vivianne, knowing my nature, swallowed a gulp of saliva before getting to the heart of the matter.
“Aruua Raven! That mage, your old comrade, is the betrayer!”
Raven was the betrayer, huh… .
My hand holding the hammer tightened.
It wasn’t because I felt betrayed, though, of course, that was part of it. 
“Waste of my time.”
She thought I dropped the pursuit just to hear this nonsense? 
Yeah, if I could just deal with this quickly and get back to chasing—
“I! I saw it with my own eyes!”
Saw what?
I thought this nonsense was just a waste of time, but unbelievably, her mouth was moving faster than my hammer.
“When the Imperial Palace Karnon was burning! She was looking at that woman, and I heard her say, ‘I didn’t think she would betray me like this… .’”
“…Are you on something?”
“Ah, no! I know it sounds crazy! But… eek! Wait! Put your hammer down! I can explain!”
“Ten seconds.”
“…What?”
“Nine, eight… .”
I ignored her and started counting down.  Understanding, Vivianne started her final statement, hurriedly.
“O, you may not know, but she used [Future Sight], a first-grade black magic.  Ah! W, well, I, I didn’t do it alone. There were other black mages, and we received tremendous support. We barely managed to pull it off… .”
“Just get to the point.”
“It was used to predict the outcome of this event, and the magic failed! We saw Karnon burn, but we didn’t see the most important scene, the King’s assassination, only some other random scene!”
“…She betrayed me, and that’s what you saw?”
“Yes! That’s right! That’s why I said I saw it with my own eyes!”
Hmm…
I guess I could listen a little longer.
“Thirty seconds added.”
“…No, really, it’s true!”
“That’s what I’m giving you time to prove. Whether it’s true or not.”
“…You want me to prove it to you in thirty seconds? How am I supposed to… ?”
Well, I don’t know.
“That’s for you to figure out.”
If she can’t convince me, I’ll just use my hammer to prove gender equality.
I slowly started counting, but Vivianne remained silent.  She seemed at a loss as to how to convince me in thirty seconds. 
“Fifteen seconds gone.”
Vivianne spoke when half the time was up.
“I don’t think I can prove it, no matter how hard I try.”
“Ten.”
“If I had more time, maybe… .”
“Nine.”
“I can’t do it in thirty seconds.”
“Eight.”
“So, within that time… .”
“Seven.”
“I’m going to tell you.”
“Six.”
“Just tell me why you shouldn’t kill me.”
“Oh?”
Wow, she’s quite the strategist, even for a mage.
“Impressive judgment. Fifteen seconds added.”
I was tired of counting every second, so I just kept track of the time in my head. Vivianne’s gambit unfolded quickly.
“You’re going to the Barbarian Sanctuary, right? I can get you there without raising any alarm.”
“I can handle it myself.”
Though it might get a little noisy in the process.
I had no reason to go out of my way to get help from a woman who used to be my enemy, even if it involved creating variables.
Vivianne, as if she had expected my response, immediately presented her next proposal.
“Communication.”
“……?”
“I can eavesdrop on the high command’s communication.”
“Hmm… .”
“Even knowing their general movements would be helpful, right? It’s not just strategy, you know. It’s so you’ll know immediately if something happens to your comrades.”
“…….”
“That’s all I have. If that’s not enough, I have nothing else to offer.”
Okay, you’re right.
“So… what are you going to do?”
She was quite bold, but she seemed terrified in this moment.
After all, who stays calm in the face of death?
No one in the world.
That’s why I was so affected by his choice back then.
“On hold, for now.”
I couldn’t stay here forever, so I picked up Vivianne, treating her like a piece of luggage, and headed for the wall.
First, I was going to discuss this with Raven.
But, before that, I had to make sure she understood something.
“About the betrayer.”
“Yes?”
“Don’t tell anyone about her. Understood?”
“Yes, yes! Of course! My mouth is a vault!”
A vault, huh.
She spilled all those secrets, even when she was in danger of death.
Back at the partially opened gate, Raven and Astarotta were waiting for me.
“Yandel!”
“It seems things have been tidied up here.”
“It couldn’t be helped. Most of the corpses lost their power as soon as you left.”
Hmm, maybe she was too busy running away to control them?
I didn’t know, but as soon as we exchanged brief greetings, Raven’s gaze moved to my shoulder.
“But that woman… that’s her, right?”
“Ah, we know each other, right?”
“Even if we didn’t know each other, I’d know.”
“Aha, haha… Hello? Long time no see, sister… .”
“…Sister?”
“What? No? I thought she was older than Yandel?”
Raven was speechless for a moment at her audacious reply.
“…Address me formally. I have never given you permission to address me like that.”
“Aha, haha… Alright, Raven.”
It wasn’t a place to have a detailed conversation in a place where everyone could see us, so we moved to a nearby building.
There wasn’t much to explain.
I chased the corpse collector and caught her.
She convinced me that she could be helpful.
If you take out the betrayer story, it all boils down to these two lines.
“So, you’re thinking about whether to use her or just get rid of her?”
“Yeah. I wanted to hear your opinion.  That’s why I brought her back alive.”
“Hmm… well, let’s confirm the conditions she offered first.”
Raven approached Vivianne.
“You said you could access the Noark’s high-level communication network. Let’s see. Maybe you’ve lost your access.”
“…Hehe, that won’t happen.”
“So, show me. We need to know what kind of important information is exchanged.”
“Okay.”
Vivianne took out a black crystal ball without saying anything and connected to the communication network. It worked perfectly.
But…
[Jivne, Tera, Didivaar.]
“What are they saying?”
“It’s a military code.  Even the Intelligence Department can’t decipher it yet.”
“I figured… It’s too easy for her to access the network. You thought you could show it to me and I wouldn’t kill you?”
“I’m not that stupid, am I?”
“Alright, alright, just decipher it. What are they saying?”
“Sector 5-3, Royal troops, signs of gathering, observation… .”
As soon as Vivianne said it, Raven and I locked eyes.
Because I knew exactly where 5-3 was. 
I asked for troops to be moved there tomorrow morning to draw attention.
‘Eavesdropping… maybe she’s not useless.’
I had to check its performance, so I asked her to translate the radio waves I could hear.
“Sector 13-2, minor battle occurring, request for reinforcements.”
“Sector 5-1, heightened alert, request for troop reinforcements.”
“Sector 13-2, clearing complete, 31 enemy units neutralized.”
“Sector 4-7… huh?”
Vivianne, who had been translating like a translator, suddenly flinched.
“What is it?”
I took a step closer, asking her what was wrong, and Vivianne opened her mouth, a bit hesitant.
“Sector 4-7 would be Sector 4, right… um… I think the two intruders are… Yandel’s comrades.”
“…And ‘L’?”
“Ricardo Ruhenpraha.  It’s a code word for our leader, brother… .”
Damn it.
