##  Chapter 548: The Secret Room (1)
87 days since entering the Labyrinth.
While conducting our morning routine, Amelia relayed a peculiar piece of news.
“A ghost… you say.” 
Amelia had found nothing when she investigated, but with multiple witnesses, we couldn’t simply ignore it.
Everyone in the guard detail, except for Amelia, had seen something during their night watch.
I decided to interview them all, though only briefly.
“I felt a strange chill and turned my head towards it. There, I saw something with white hair staring back at me.”
From Mikhail Lectus, a veteran from the Royal Investigation Department, to the others who had witnessed the ghost, their descriptions varied drastically.
“What I saw was a beastly monster with fangs this long…”
“Mine was a bit different. It was a man in tattered clothes. His eyes were completely black, and he was weeping blood while staring at me with an accusatory gaze.”
“What I saw resembled a slime. It was stuck to the floor like melted goo, approaching me in the shadows. Then, after blinking for a second, it vanished. I just assumed it was a figment of my imagination because I was exhausted.”
Each account was entirely different.
However, there was one common thread.
They all said the apparition had vanished in front of their eyes when they momentarily looked away.
“Did you all see it yesterday?”
“No, the sightings occurred at different times.  After Lectus mentioned it during his watch yesterday, I asked everyone. It seems everyone, except for me, had encountered something at least once.”
Right, I see.
As I stroked my chin, lost in contemplation, a grating sound echoed from beside me.
Crrrck, crrrck, crrrck-crrrck-!
The source was Ainar’s jaw.
Barbarians tend to clench their jaws when they feel fear.
“A, a ghost…!! I, it’s dangerous, isn’t it…!!“
Come to think of it, Ainar has always been terrified of these things.
Or rather, most barbarians are.
They experience a visceral discomfort toward spectral monsters and even develop a fear of them.
Curiosity got the better of me, so I once asked Raven about this phenomenon. Her answer was…
“It’s in their blood.”
In other words, there’s a possibility that their genes contain information about a natural predator that cannot be defeated with physical strength.
Perhaps this fear, stemming from instinct, manifests itself in a large number of barbarians?
Well, that isn’t important right now.
“I smell it.”
“Huh? Smell? Do you smell meat…!”
Ainar, with a greater craving for meat than fear of ghosts, started sniffing around.
I found it amusing, but I ignored her.
The smell I was picking up was different.
‘Meat is nice, but…’
There are things in this world more delicious than meat.
The smell I was picking up was one of them.
‘Hidden piece.’
For any player of [Dungeon & Stone], it’s an irresistible lure upon discovery.
The moment I heard about the ghost, the scent arrived.
Churp.
The scent of a hidden piece, filled with milk and honey.
And it was very strong.
***
A hidden piece.
In this world, it’s called the legacy of Gavrillius.
I had discovered countless hidden pieces while playing [Dungeon & Stone], so I immediately began work.
First, I needed information.
A lot of information, varied enough for statistical analysis.
“Time… you ask?”
“It was a little after one in the morning.”
“The first watch, so… around 11 pm.”
After questioning all the soldiers who claimed to have seen the ghost, I concluded that the ghost only appeared between 11 pm and 3 am.
Could this be a coincidence?
‘Absolutely not.’
The time for the library ghost to appear is between 11 pm and 3 am.
“There! There. It was right there, watching me.”
“I was above the bookshelves when I saw it…”
“In my case, it was by the staircase leading outside.”
The location seems random.
Well, perhaps it would be more accurate to say that the entire library is random.
“Mister, do you think that ghost might be one of Gavrillius’s arrangements?”
As I was diligently conducting my research, Erwen looked at me with a curious expression.
It wasn’t just her, though.
“Yes, for now at least.”
When I confirmed this, the eyes of all the adventurers who had overheard our conversation lit up.
“Gavrillius’s arrangement!”
“It’s real!”
Armin’s Exploration Team, who specialized in finding hidden pieces, needed no further prompting. Even the members of Hect’s Clan displayed a burning desire.
Well, how could any adventurer resist?
“So… we get treasure if we find that ghost? They say those who find his arrangements all become rich.”
Even Ainar, who had been terrified of the ghost, revealed her true thoughts. Oh, but everyone didn’t lose their minds over it.
Only one.
Only one expressed their concerns.
“Yandell, you’re being too optimistic. It’s dangerous.”
Amelia Rainwells.
My companion, bound to me by a timeless bond.
“Dangerous, how so?”
“Exactly as I said. It seems you’re focusing on the positive too much, unlike yourself.”
Ah, I think I understand what she means.
In truth, I thought about it right after hearing about the ghost.
Could it be that someone is using this ghost as a surveillance tool, and we stumbled upon it?
‘Like the Village Chief, for example.’
The incident with the Silver Lion Clan Leader, who had returned to the library and made a hasty escape, also came to mind.
Taking the ghost’s existence as a mere boon is a dangerous move.
Perhaps it isn’t a boon at all, and not even the Village Chief is involved.
“Emily, I understand what you mean. I’m taking it all into account, so don’t worry too much.”
“…Then it’s fine. I understand.”
“Right. Thank you for telling me.”
My gut instinct still screamed that the ghost was connected to a hidden piece, but as per Amelia’s advice, I resolved to be more cautious.
Assuming the worst-case scenario always helps.
‘I’ll figure out which is the case… once night falls.’
After reaching that conclusion, I resumed my usual routine, summoning monsters throughout the day. 
I only took short breaks and spent the whole day fighting monsters, but unfortunately, today wasn’t very fruitful.
‘Just one fourth-grade essence… and I can’t even eat it.’
Usually, this would be considered a jackpot and I’d keep it in a vial, but I’ve grown beyond this level of satisfaction.
‘Sigh.’
The biggest disappointment was that I managed to find two more Bellarioses and even defeated them, but they didn’t yield essences.
However, if things continue like this, I should be able to obtain one before leaving the first floor. The higher the bookshelves become, the more frequently they appear in books.
‘Anyway, what should I do with the remaining essence slot?’
I have two essence slots left.
One is permanently filled with a Bellarios essence, and a Hipramaessence is slated to be replaced by an Orc Hero slot later on, so they’re not an option.
The remaining slot has me perplexed.
It’s not something I can just casually decide on.
I had thought about filling it in preparation for a potential conflict with the Village Chief, but I can’t get any graduate essences in my current state.
Unless another Rift Guardian like Milaiel appears on the eighth floor, whatever I consume will need to be erased in a few months.
‘…I’ll think about it as I go. It’s not a pressing matter right now.’
If I hadn’t obtained the Aegis Barrier, it would be different.
Now that I have a graduate shield, even if the Village Chief is involved, there’s no reason for me to rush.
With that thought, I ended my contemplation.
Tick, tock-
The library, ready for the night’s encampment after a day’s work.
[23:00]
Night had fallen.
***
11 pm.
For our exploration team, this is the time for everyone to rest, except for those on night watch, in preparation for tomorrow’s routine.
However, many were still awake.
“The arrangement of the Great Sage… you say.”
“Is it really true?”
“Regardless of the truth, I’m curious. Perhaps it will be the key to escaping this place.”
Like children unable to sleep the night before an excursion, the adventurers lay there chatting amongst themselves.
For goodness sake, just go to sleep! If you stay awake too long, it might not show up!
After making the rounds, catching those who refused to sleep, the library fell silent. Of course, it was only the conversations that had ceased; the library was far from tranquil.
Dr-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-ng-!
Doron-g. Doron-g, doro-lon-g-
Dozens of adventurers snored softly and loudly.
“They all seem to be asleep.”
“So, what are you going to do from now on?”
“What else? I’ll just have to go around and find it.”
After verifying that everyone was asleep, I set out with Amelia and Versil on patrol.
And…
“So… we’re supposed to keep this up until 3 am?”
After patrolling for an hour without any sign of the ghost, Versil spoke up.
He didn’t seem to mind the patrol too much, but…
“How’s Yandell doing these days?”
He seemed bored with just standing around, so I naturally took it as a cue for a little chit-chat.
“How’s he doing, you ask? What do you mean?”
“Just, you know, in general. Everyone’s curious.”
“Curious about what?”
When I asked again, Versil glanced at Amelia, who was patrolling alone a distance away, and whispered quietly.
“So who is it?”
“No, please, can you use a subject pronoun?”
“Come on, you know what I mean.”
Well, that’s true.
I’m not that oblivious.
I chuckled and replied.
“No one.”
“Really? I thought you two were a couple, even if others didn’t know.”
“That’s impossible. We’re just colleagues.”
“Hee… Is that so?”
Versil responded with a skeptical tone, then brought up another name.
“Then how about Calstain? You two have been spending a lot of time together lately.”
“Well, yeah.”
It’s just that we’re a little less awkward now.
We’ve been talking more often lately. Mostly it’s trivial stuff like how good the food is, or how I should eat more vegetables.
“Everyone’s curious about you.  After all, you are the Baron’s only ex-lover.”
Oh, spending too much time in the Labyrinth has made everyone obsessed with these things.
Small talk during patrol is welcome, but these topics are stressful, so I decided to end this conversation here.
“Enough with the gossip and shut up. Are they all sleeping?”
These precious resources need to be well-rested for tomorrow’s hard work.
“…”
What, why isn’t he answering?
Is he sulking?
With that thought, I turned around.
“…Yandell.”
Versil, walking behind me, stopped and whispered as if using ventriloquism.
“There, over there.”
His head was turned toward me, but his eyes were looking in the other direction, indicating the direction. I followed his gaze.
And…
“Right? That’s it, the ghost people were talking about.”
“I don’t know for sure, but it’s worth checking out.”
“…It’s kinda scary. No one mentioned it looked so hideous.”
I unconsciously tilted my head, unable to understand what he was talking about.
‘Hideous…?’
Versil and I seem to be seeing entirely different things.
‘Strange.’
All I see is a little rat.
***
A mysterious creature inhabiting the library.
The only known traits are that it appears between 11 pm and 3 am, and that each person sees a different form.
The creature is quite enigmatic, but capturing it was surprisingly easy.
“The character has cast [Eye of the Storm].”
“The power of the Transcendent grants access to the abilities inherent in this skill.”
It flew in with just one grapple.
[Beep? Beep, beep—!!!]
It was so small that I didn’t even need [Enlargement] to capture it. It fit neatly in one hand.
But at that moment.
[Beep, beep! Be-eep-beep-beep!!]
The rat, screaming and thrashing, started becoming translucent.
I was about to panic and crush it, but…
“Versil Goulond has cast the eighth-grade curse magic [Materialize].”
Versil reacted just in time, and the rat’s body returned to its original form.
“What was that noise just now…?”
Amelia, who had heard the commotion and rushed over, frowned at me.
“Yandell, what’s that in your hand?”
“I don’t know. What does it look like to you?”
“…A very squishy and disgusting something.”
“Really? Versil, what about you?”
“A man covered in filth… strangely enough, he resembles someone I know.”
“Someone you know…?”
“Yandell, you don’t know him.”
Hmm, I see.
[Beep, beep! Be-eep-beep-beep!!]
I licked my lips and looked down at what I was holding.
It looked like a normal rat.
Like a hamster standing on two legs.
The only difference from Earth hamsters is that this one was incredibly large.  In fact, it was big enough to play with dwarves using acorns as measuring tools.
[Beep! Beep—! Be-eep-beep-beep!!!]
Seeing it struggle with all its might makes it look kinda cute.
But that’s that, and this is this.
“Let’s wake everyone up, first… though that might not be necessary.”
The soldiers who had already heard the commotion were all awake and looking at me.
“…Is that the ghost?”
“What a hideous form.”
“If I had seen it alone at night, I would have surely panicked…”
Regardless of their reactions, I headed towards the center of the library, clutching the rat.
And…
Thud.
I placed the rat on the altar where I used to summon books.
“…This doesn’t work?”
Unfortunately, the altar didn’t react in any way.
So…
[Beep, beep! Be-eep-beep-beep!!]
Two options remained:
1. Just kill it.
2. Kill it with a Distortion magic.
Which one should I test?
With only one specimen, I had to choose carefully.
[Beep! Beep! Be-eep-beep-beep!!!]
As I contemplated my options, the rat, tied to the altar like a lab rat, suddenly started talking.
[This, this barbaric creature!! Release me! I said, release me!]
