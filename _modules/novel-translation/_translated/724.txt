## Chapter 724: A Limited Time (3)
What was the Emperor’s reason for ordering me to kill the Chancellor? 
“Was it because the royal family’s power alone wasn’t enough to kill the Chancellor?”
No, that couldn’t be it.  Having played through the rebellion route thousands of times in the game, I knew better than anyone how powerful the royal family truly was.
“Then, was it simply to outsource the task, conserving their own strength?”
While a better explanation, it still lacked practicality. I wasn’t some reliable troubleshooter who had worked with the royal family multiple times; from their perspective, there was no reason to take such a roundabout approach.
“They even held me captive for a week to plan this… .”
It didn’t make sense to just do it for amusement.  The Emperor, after all, is someone who values ‘time’ above all else.  
Therefore, it's best to assume one of two possibilities.
“Either the Emperor had a reason he couldn’t directly harm the Chancellor.”
Or, there was a specific ‘benefit’ only obtainable by my eliminating the Chancellor.
Of course, this was just my speculation, and I had no idea what that ‘reason’ or ‘benefit’ could be— 
“You seem deep in thought,” the Emperor remarked, urging me to answer.  Only then did I regain my composure and speak. 
There was only one possible response.
“Fine. I’ll do it. That bastard was a pain in the neck anyway.”
“Oh, because of that incident…?”
He was referring to the incident, wasn’t he? 
“I want to clarify: I had absolutely no involvement in that. It was the Chancellor’s reckless decision.”
He seemed to be talking about the Icerock expedition. It appears the royal family was aware of our sentiments, to some degree. 
“So, channel your vengeful spirit towards the right place.”
He said this, but it didn’t change my feelings towards the royal family. Even if the Chancellor acted alone, didn’t the royal family give him that level of power?
I believe both tacit consent and inaction constitute complicity.
“…Still, if what he said is true, it does ease my mind somewhat.”
Even if I contributed, there was a difference in the degree of contribution. Perhaps there was room for leniency?  
The level of hatred I felt wasn’t enough for me to risk my life on.
Maybe I felt this way because hatred for the ‘royal family’ is ultimately unhelpful in navigating this world.  Whatever the case, I said—
“Well, then, that’s all for today—.”
“Wait!”
I stopped the Emperor as he was turning away from me, about to head towards the ‘life support machine’. I had one final question.
Of course, I wasn’t sure if he’d answer.
“Down there.”
“… .”
“What was trapped down there?”
The Emperor stared at me silently for a moment.
“…You’ve become quite curt, haven’t you?  Thought you were done with your questions.”
Uh…. 
I didn’t really mean to be curt, but I remained silent, staring at him expectantly.  
After a tense pause, he finally responded.
…Or rather, he didn’t really answer.
“How did you know something was trapped there?”
He responded to my question with a question. 
I pondered for a moment before replying honestly.
“I heard a voice pleading to be released. It was a young girl, about ten years old.”
Therefore, I concluded: 
This ten-year-old girl might be the ‘Earth Witch’.
“…Is that so.”
“So, what’s the answer?”
Again, the Emperor took a moment, his face in thought.  Was it such a difficult question to answer? 
It seemed that way. Even after I said all of that, he still refused to give me a direct answer.
“…Bjorn Jandel, you know nothing. You don’t know how this world survives, or the sacrifices we make to keep it going.”
“… .”
“This is the end of our conversation.  We’ll continue this discussion after this matter is concluded.”
That’s all? 
I felt a pang of emptiness.  Should I try to press him for more information? 
But before I could act, a knight stepped forward, blocking my path.
“…He said that’s all.”
The Emperor remained silent throughout the knight’s actions, confirming that this was the end of our discussion.  
So, I just stared ahead blankly, like a dog chasing a chicken.
Silently, the Emperor began to undress before my eyes. Soon, completely naked, he gracefully climbed into the machine.
Whirring sounds filled the air as a mysterious liquid began to bubble inside the machine. The Emperor closed his eyes slowly, marking the end of the whole ordeal.
‘He really seems to be asleep… .’
The audience was over, short but incredibly long.
***
After witnessing the Emperor enter the machine and fall asleep, I was escorted back up by the imposing knight. Back in the empty audience chamber, I heard an unexpected statement.
“The Emperor instructed me to give you whatever you request and offer full cooperation.”
Oh, so that’s the case… .
So, it seems he wasn’t just throwing me to the wolves.
“What do you desire?”
I already had my answer ready for the knight’s question.
“I want to see the rest of what I was watching.”
“…I will prepare it.”
I then resumed watching the video I had stopped before.
Of course, to save time… .
“Can I fast-forward while watching it?”
“I’ll adjust the playback speed.”
The video started playing at a staggering 8x speed.
But it ended much sooner than I expected.
The video itself was short from the beginning.
“Where’s part two?”
“There isn’t one.”
“So, this is it?”
The mad movie of the Anabad Clan, who forged a path through the front lines, leading the remaining explorers, ended with my comrades breaking through the front lines and reaching the barbarian’s sanctuary. 
It was simply too short to continue.
“Our enemies know more about the royal family than anyone.”
“But why does that matter?”
“They must have prepared methods to avoid our ‘eyes’, which is why they orchestrated this pointless scheme.”
It seems the video was captured using a strategic weapon possessed by the royal family. At that moment, the Chancellor seemingly interfered to nullify its effect. 
“The Emperor said you would kneel after watching this far.”
That assumption was completely off the mark, by the way. 
I had knelt even before watching that part.
‘So, what should I do now… .’
After a moment of thought, I asked the knight his name. He flinched slightly.
“…I don’t think we have any reason to share our names.”
Oh, what’s this? 
I was merely asking to avoid calling him ‘knight guy’ in the future.
I smirked. I couldn’t just let him get away with that, not as a barbarian warrior.
“You dare defy the Emperor’s order!”
My booming voice, like that of a martial arts expert yelling ‘Go!’, left the knight staring at me like I was crazy.
It was a familiar look, one I’d become accustomed to.
Still, I felt a bit wronged this time. 
“Didn’t you say the compassionate and wise Emperor ordered you to give me whatever I asked and offer full cooperation?”
My kind explanation seemed to finally confuse the knight, who had initially chuckled as if mocking my request. 
‘Huh? But he did say that, didn’t he?  So if I don’t comply with this request, will I be defying the Emperor’s orders?’
His excessive loyalty to the king caused a malfunction.
The knight sighed, finally revealing his name.
“…Astarotta Verun.”
Hmm, a rather ordinary name, unlike what I expected.  I thought perhaps he didn’t want to share his name because it was a very famous one, something I should know. 
‘Then, what was with his reaction just now?’
Perhaps he just didn’t want to share his name with a barbarian like me?
“Astarotta, huh… a nice, pretty name.”
I threw out a casual compliment, a bait, just in case.
And it paid off.  He reacted immediately.
“My name is not in any way feminine.”
“I never said it was.”
“… .”
Astarotta fell silent, realizing he had just admitted his insecurities.
“Anyway, since we’re meeting like this, I’ll rely on you in the future, Elizabeth.”
“…It’s Astarotta, not Elizabeth.”
“Oh, sorry. I got it wrong.”
He stayed silent, realizing I was teasing him.
Of course, it didn’t really matter.
The advantage of barbarians is that we can use even minor weaknesses like this to seize the initiative.
“…Anyway, what are we going to do now?”
He changed the subject, his intention obvious, and I didn’t push him further.
After all, I’m not a psychopath. 
I only torment him for a reason.
So, I said—
“I don’t know, but you have a task.”
“Tell me.”
“Bring Raven here.”
She’s probably freaking out right now.
***
Ricardo Riuhenpraha.
The head of the Orculis, also known as the ‘Rebel’. 
The Duke, who had only heard of this man through reports and stories from the intelligence division, felt a sense of awe as he finally saw him with his own eyes.
‘…The Rebel, huh.’
This man’s fearsome moniker would likely disappear after this.
Whether it ended in success or failure.
He wouldn’t be known by that name anymore.
‘…No, wait.’
Would he not be called by that name if it ended in success?
After all, no one would dare challenge the authority of the state.
‘…I seem to be overthinking.’
The Duke then focused on the man standing before him. 
Had he been summoned because this was the first step of his grand plan?
“I heard you requested a private meeting. Speak your mind.”
The Duke initiated the conversation, and the man in front of him slowly responded.
Short and concise, as was his nature.
“Bjorn Jandel was sighted at the front lines.”
“…I see. Thank you for informing me. I’ll look into the rest on my own.”
The Duke nodded, remaining silent after the straightforward information was relayed. The man, having nothing more to say, turned and left the room.
Thud, thud.
The Duke’s face remained impassive, but his continuously moving fingers betrayed his anxiety. 
“Bjorn Jandel… .”
Did he think he could escape death by being swallowed by the collapsing prison?
Of course not.
“It’s that bastard again… .”
I wasn’t surprised.
Initially, he was just an annoying pest. But, perhaps I had subconsciously known all along.
That a day like this would come.
That he might be the biggest obstacle to achieving my grand ambition.
Thump-!
The Duke’s heart pounded wildly.
Yet, nothing changed.
The day I’d hoped would never come had finally arrived.
“Everything shall unfold according to plan.”
There was nothing left to do but trust fate.
