##  The Eye of the Glacier (1)
We returned to the 7th floor of Ice Rock, the field at the very end being the Eye of the Glacier.
“A character has entered a special area.”
“Field effect - Eye of the Glacier applied.”
“All healing and recovery effects are reversed.”
“Status ailment [Whispers of Immortality] applied.”
“Upon death, the character will be resurrected as an undead.”
“Status ailment [Opportunity Deprivation] applied.”
The frozen air enveloped my lungs, the warm sunshine of the 8th floor a distant memory. We had no time to adjust to the sudden change in environment, compelled to move swiftly.
“Naria, summon the trolls!”
Three Ice Trolls, each pulling a sled laden with thirteen days’ worth of supplies. We had requisitioned all the food from our personal subspaces, enough to last for weeks. But, we had intentionally brought only this much, exactly enough to last until the dungeon closed. We needed the remaining space for combat and exploration equipment. 
“Into formation!” 
With twenty-five members in our expedition, thirteen days’ worth of rations would be sufficient, even in the harshest of conditions. 
“Let’s move!”
We immediately started ascending the Eye of the Glacier, retracing the path we had descended over the past ten days. It was a narrow, spiraling uphill climb along the edge of a cliff, but our pace was much faster than before. There were no monsters in this area since the portal opened. It would take no more than five days to escape this field. 
The problem was the pursuit squad trailing behind. 
‘They would leave us be, if they were sane.’
After all, entering Ice Rock required considerable preparation: thick fur clothing for warmth, a heating stone – a type of magical tool – food, and a sled to transport it all. A typical adventurer carrying only a subspace would find themselves in immediate trouble upon stepping into this area. 
But…
‘If they’re like him, they’ll definitely come.’
It was too early to be at ease. Our lives were at stake, not just mine, but the lives of my comrades and countless others. We had to prepare for the worst. And that’s why…
We pressed on, our steps heavy despite the rest we had taken, still carrying the weight of exhaustion. 
Eight hours later, a female mage from Kailslan’s team approached me urgently.
“Suiz! Suiz! It’s serious! Really, really serious!”
She was much taller than Raven, and her appearance seemed perfectly normal, yet she spoke in a way that defied any expectations of a soldier.
“It’s serious, is it? Then, it must be about that?”
“Yes! The detection magic we set up at the portal activated!”
“I see…”
They had followed us to Ice Rock. I’d expected it, but they had actually done it. 
“How many?”
“I watched after activating the detection magic, and it’s definitely over twenty!”
“Definitely over twenty? What do you mean?”
“They noticed sooner than we thought, and because my spirit eyes were destroyed, I couldn’t see anyone else entering.”
I instinctively licked my lips. It was frustrating; knowing the size of their force would be a significant aid in making decisions.
“What did they look like? How were they equipped?”
“Hmm, are you curious if they were as well-prepared as us?”
“Yes.”
When I nodded, the mage chuckled and responded, “They’re completely unprepared! Thin cloaks over their equipment? They all had bulky bags, probably full of food. Not expandable bags, so they’ll be hungry soon and probably turn back.”
Her initial expression of worry had vanished, replaced by a smile that implied she saw this as good news. And she was right; it was good news. 
‘Cloaks aside, bags…  Of course, few adventurers carry sleds or carts.’ 
The carrying capacity of a bag was limited. Bringing thirteen days’ worth of rations in a bag, with a hunger multiplier of three, was impossible in this place. Backpacks, especially expandable ones, were a liability in combat due to their weight and the restriction they imposed on movement. In the early stages, when subspaces were rare, some low-level teams even hired extra porters. It was that inconvenient. 
“Alright. We’ll set up another one here and move on. We need to get a more accurate number.”
“Yes!”
We stopped briefly and set up another detection spell. Once finished, we resumed our journey, moving even faster than before, our pace quickened by the rest we had taken.
***
The mage came running towards me again, breathlessly, six hours later.
“Suiz! Suiz!”
Her innocent voice, full of panic, was a clear sign of bad news. 
“It’s much faster than I thought.”
The detection spell, set up eight hours ago, had activated after only six hours. That meant they were faster than us. If things continued at this pace, they would catch up in two days.
“Ah, they don’t have to pull sleds like us... That’s probably why they’re so fast……”
I was starting to understand their motivation. They must be desperate for food, wanting to catch up as soon as their rations allowed and end this quickly.
“What’s the size?”
“Ah! I made sure to confirm! It’s… forty-six!”
“Good news. Thanks.”
“It’s my duty!”
The mage saluted playfully, but then her expression changed. Something had suddenly come to mind.
“Ah, right. I… ”
She turned her head back to me after saluting, and with a cautious voice, she said, “There were some people who seemed out of place. Their equipment… It was totally different from the others. The black mage who was the first to notice my detection spell was one of them.”
“… ”
“W, well, it’s just my personal judgement, so don’t worry too much!”
“Alright. I’ll be careful.”
“Yes… Oh, one more thing! What should we do with the detection magic? Should we keep using it?”
“No need. We have an idea of their size, so we just need to know when they’ve passed through.”
“Yes!”
The mage returned to her position after delivering her message, and the goblin beside me muttered in a strange voice.
“That… Marone-dono is always so lively.”
What the hell is this guy on about?
Even in a situation like this, he's thinking about that?
I was about to scold him to stop his nonsense and focus on the path ahead, but he continued to mutter. 
“If only we could survive this… ”
His voice was filled with melancholy as he gazed at the mage’s retreating figure.
I couldn’t help but agree.
“Yes, if only we could survive this… ”
“… ”
Silence fell between us. Then, Lavien, walking beside me, spoke up.
“Speaking of which, Parav-dono, how are you feeling now?”
He’d been treating me like an idiot at first. 
Now he’s asking me first?
Of course, she witnessed his uncanny intuition with her own eyes.
She walked beside me and saw how Parav’s instincts worked.
“That… I’m not sure. All I know is that we have to keep going up, no matter how hard it gets.”
“… I see.”
The surrounding air suddenly turned gloomy. I cleared my throat and changed the subject.
“Parav, why did you join this expedition?”
“… Yes?”
“With that intuition of yours, shouldn’t you be able to avoid this sort of thing?”
I had been curious about this for a while.
The first floor incident happened because he didn't enter the dungeon because of his intuition.
But, why did he join the dungeon this time?
“Actually… I didn’t want to come from the start.”
“What?”
“I’m not saying this just to say it.”
“It’s the truth. When the Archbishop joined, he offered me a huge reward to join the expedition, but I wasn’t interested. So I tried to get out of it, using various excuses… ”
“And?”
“The Archbishop sighed as he looked at me. I felt a chill run down my spine and quickly said I’d join. It’s better to walk a thorny path than to be on the execution stand, wouldn’t you agree?”
“… What? Execution stand? I don’t understand.”
“It’s hard to explain without sounding strange, but it felt like I would be killed if I refused. If I refused, I would be killed on the spot. It felt like that. I felt like going into the dungeon was a better option, you know?”
“Ah… ”
“Well, now I regret it. The Archbishop would never have actually killed me. Hahaha… ”
The goblin laughed awkwardly, and Lavien, who had been unsure about his intuition, seemed to accept his explanation. 
But…
‘Something’s off.’
I felt a sense of unease. I couldn’t put my finger on it, but…
“Parav, do you have any idea why you felt that way about the Archbishop?”
“Hmm, I never thought about it… Maybe he planned to give me a different, more dangerous task, but… ”
We continued talking as we moved, but I couldn’t shake off the unease. We stopped chatting to conserve our energy, focusing on the journey. I had a lot to think about. 
‘At this rate, we’ll be caught up to in two days.’
It would be the same even if we increased our speed. 
We would be caught before we left the Eye of the Glacier. 
What do we do then?
How do we make myself, my comrades, and everyone else safer?
My heart pounded. It was overwhelming to think about all of this.
***
The sound of a whetstone against a sword. 
The sound of jerky being chewed.
“Haha, really?”
“Yes. When we get back to the city, let’s go together. I didn’t believe it at first.”
Some were chatting amongst themselves, having gotten closer, while others were sitting in meditation, breathing rhythmically. 
Simple reasons, really.
Everyone has their own way of relieving tension.
“… You should rest too, old man.”
“I’ll rest here. You go back to your place.”
“But… ”
“Go on.”
Erwen, with slumped shoulders, returned to her place after I gave her a command. I gazed at the darkness beyond the downward slope. 
“They’ve been considerate, don’t you think? Was it necessary to be so harsh?”
“Lavien, don’t overstep.”
“… Okay.”
I was going to say something, but stopped after seeing my expression. She immediately shut her mouth.
I looked out into the darkness.
“… ”
We were now in the middle of the Eye of the Glacier. Our upward climb had stopped, not by choice, but by necessity. 
It was a simple calculation. In one hour, the pursuit squad would reach this place.
My heart pounded, a sensation of unease, not anticipation for battle.
“… ”
It was no wonder. I had tried to find a way to avoid combat, but no good ideas came to mind. 
Combat was inevitable.
So, I ordered a rest so that we could at least get some rest beforehand. 
But was that the reason… 
“Haha!”
The sound of a whetstone against a sword.
“… ”
The sound of jerky being chewed.
The mundane sounds, normally peaceful, sounded like the calm before the storm.
And that must be why I was gazing into the darkness, unable to rest properly.
There were forty-six enemies. Almost twice the number in our expedition. 
The mage had told me that ten of them were particularly strong. 
Their equipment was on par with Dragonslayers, if not better.
‘Maybe they brought a few of the ones who attacked the 8th floor with them.’
If that were the case, it would be truly dangerous.
To contribute significantly to the 8th floor attack, one would need to be at least Amelia’s level.
We wouldn't stand a chance in a direct confrontation.
But…
“… ”
There was no other option.
The fight was inevitable.
No matter how strong they were, we had to do our best.
‘Well, if we fail, we’ll all die.’
Whizzing back and forth.
I shook my head, shaking off the intrusive thoughts.
I decided to focus on positive possibilities from now on.
For example, what if the enemies were weaker than we expected?
In that case, we might even be able to defeat them here.
Of course, even then, there would be casualties... 
But, if we won, this expedition would be over.
We wouldn’t have to climb further. We could simply stay here, eat our remaining rations, and wait it out. 
Squeezing.
Yes, that scenario was definitely possible.
Therefore...
“Detection magic! The detection magic triggered!”
Let's do it.
“Everyone into formation!”
Beyond the eerily silent darkness.
What would remain after the storm had passed was still unknown. 
“… They’re coming.”
There was only one thing we could do.
“Prepare for battle!”
Fight.
