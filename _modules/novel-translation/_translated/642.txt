## Chapter 642: Political Marriage (6)
I wasn't known for sharing my personal life with others, but today, I decided to be open about it. After all, if I brushed it aside, they'd likely bring it up again, and... it was about a daughter (though not my own), and a child they considered almost like a daughter.
"Misha Kalstain and I are just colleagues."
My first words immediately furrowed the brow of the clan leader. He stared at me, his eyes questioning how I could call myself a mere colleague when I was preventing his daughter's marriage. The fairy representative, on the other hand, seemed pleased.  It was fleeting, however.
"Oh, in that case—."
"The same goes for Erwen Pornach di Tercia."
The fairy representative’s expression hardened upon hearing my next statement.
"Ho, then she’s still unattached?"
Seizing this opportunity, the dragon man tried to make a play, but I shut him down swiftly.
"That doesn't mean I'll become your son-in-law. I haven't considered either Pen or Lavien romantically, not even for a second."
"Ah, I understand. Love between a man and a woman is important.  It's a shame."
Surprisingly, the dragon man readily agreed. He then asked,
"Might I offer you some advice?"
"...I'm listening."
"A man of your caliber may not need a political marriage. You've achieved so much on your own."
"However, it's a matter of—"
The dragon man took a sip of his tea, then continued, his gaze locked on mine.
"Ironically, regardless of who you marry, your union will be used politically. Keep that in mind."
His advice felt so natural, as if every mention of marriage had been a deliberate setup for this moment. Perhaps the dragon man truly wanted to inform me about the reactions of the clan leader and the fairy representative.
After all, wasn't this a tumultuous time, what with the invasion of Noark and the blockade of Bifron? It was unlikely that the experienced clan leader and fairy representative genuinely wanted to push their daughters into marriage, especially not during such chaos.
"Anyway, if you don't have a specific partner in mind, come visit the temple often. Our youngest daughter is looking forward to seeing you."
Hmm... Suddenly, the intention behind his advice felt insincere. But regardless, I said,
"...Pen is absolutely not an option."
"Oh, then what about her older sister?"
"...."
The dragon man burst into a boisterous laughter, completely incongruous with his serious demeanor, as he stared at me with a look of incredulous amusement.
"Hahaha! Just a joke, a joke. So you all better stop picking on this friend of mine, alright?"
His laughter dispelled the tense atmosphere, and everyone felt relieved.
‘Is this what wisdom looks like…?’
His intervention effectively silenced the clan leader and the fairy representative, but...
"Speaking of which, I'd like to discuss this situation. What are your thoughts?"
The dragon man seamlessly changed the topic, and the discussion about my marriage was effectively closed.
"This situation…."
"You must be referring to the invasion of Noark."
Eager to gather information I hadn’t heard before, I listened intently.  Unfortunately, there was no substantial gain.  Melbes and this place seemed to be in a similar situation.
"Rumor has it that there's a magician in Noark who inherited the vision of a Great Sage."
"It’s understandable that there are such rumors, considering they tampered with the protective magic circle without any royal artifacts."
"However, there’s a high possibility that it’s not just a rumor."
"Yes…  The magic they used to teleport tens of thousands of Noarkians simultaneously from the underground fortress was quite something."
Although there were a few points brought up in the conversation that I hadn't heard in Melbes, they were simply things that had been discovered over time. The intelligence level between the two groups seemed to be on par.
After all, Melbes was a coalition of nobles from various races.  It was only natural that they'd possess similar information to the head of each race, and vice versa.
‘Well, the dragon man definitely knows something.’
Unintentionally, that feeling was palpable during the conversation. The other representatives sensed it as well, but the dragon man simply maintained a stoic expression as he brushed aside their inquiries.
"Well, I don't know anything. If I learn anything, I'll let you know."
Hmm, he definitely knows something.
Would he whisper a little something to me if I ask him later? I don't know. But the rest of the meeting continued with fruitless discussions before finally ending.
"It was a beneficial session. Let's meet again sometime."
After the meeting, we all got up and left the hall. As I reached the entrance, I couldn’t shake off a feeling of deprivation.
“…Dumoca, you’ve worked hard."
"Lagsian, I’ve prepared the carriage."
"I will escort you to the sanctuary, clan leader."
The dwarves, fairies, and beastmen, as well as the viscount, all came out with their soldiers and servants to greet us. Oh, and the dragonfolk had only brought one person.
"Ahem…!"
The white-haired dragon man, upon seeing me, quickly hid something he was fiddling with. This was the same dragon man who had presented me with a ring puzzle in the Temple of Dragons, testing my insight.
"Oh, so you found another one?"
Intrigued, I tried to peek at the hidden puzzle, but the dragon man panicked and turned around.
"Th, this is a different object from that one…."
Huh?  Why is he talking like that?
Ah… Maybe I can’t be casual anymore, since I’m a noble and a clan leader now?
“May I have a look?”
The dragon man shuddered at my question and looked towards the dragon man for help.
Come on, no one's hurting him.
‘I can’t say whatever I want anymore.’
In the past, I didn’t have any qualms, because I lacked power and status. But now I felt like I was being a bully.
“Forget it. I won’t look. Now go.”
“…Thank you.”
No, thank you?
Did someone threaten to take it away?
"Well, we should be going now.  Come visit the temple sometime.  You are always welcome.”
“I will.”
Understanding it was more than just a polite statement, I nodded.  The dragon man then disappeared right before my eyes, with a cool and casual goodbye.
“So long.”
Ah, he used dragon speech for spatial movement, didn’t he?
Is there any race as overpowered as a dragonfolk?
‘Then I should—.’
As I was about to leave the bustling entrance, a persistent and uncomfortable gaze caught my attention.
‘What’s this guy’s problem?’
The source of the stare was one of the many fairyfolk accompanying the fairy representative.
‘…Huh?’
Upon making eye contact with me, the fairy man strode towards me, then revealed his identity.
“It’s a pleasure to meet you, Baron Yandel.  I am Beleg Shucia di Tercia.”
A familiar name that I had heard many times.
"Ah, you're the…."
Beleg Shucia di Tercia.
A top explorer with unparalleled prestige among the fairyfolk and...
"Erwen’s uncle."
One of the few remaining "family" members Erwen had.
This was my first time meeting him, but I had heard many stories about him from Erwen, and I felt a certain fondness for him. After all, it was he who saved Erwen and her sister when a dragonslayer attacked the fairy sanctuary.
He had helped Erwen in various ways since then.
"Nice to meet you.  I always wanted to meet you."
"I feel the same."
“…Huh?”
Intending to shake his hand, I felt a significant amount of strength in his grip.
At first, I wondered what was going on.  I couldn't remember the last time I had experienced something like this.
‘Hmm….’
For a moment, I considered resisting, but decided to just wait without retaliating.
He was a person Erwen was grateful to.
Besides, what would I gain from overpowering him?
‘Ah, yes, this is what being an adult is all about….’
With that thought in mind, I chuckled and remained still. He then loosened his grip, ending the handshake.
And then...
"As expected, rumors are completely unreliable."
…Huh?
What?  Did he become confident because he thought I was weak?
I was just about to tilt my head in confusion when he continued.
“Your demeanor is far from hasty, and you don’t waste energy on meaningless battles.  That makes you a formidable adversary.”
He then bowed before me with a serious expression, continuing his praise.
"I’m relieved, thanks to you.  I’ll leave her in your care."
I felt a bit bewildered.
If I had resisted his handshake, I wouldn’t have received this kind of evaluation.
However, that feeling of ambiguity was fleeting.
"Well, I must be going…."
Beleg Shucia di Tercia rejoined his group at the fairy representative’s gesture, but I was still overwhelmed by a strange sensation.
‘Beleg Shucia di Tercia….’
Why did he keep reminding me of something?
***
The interracial conference was more of a let down than I expected.
It was also filled with an unexpected kind of discomfort.
‘…Phew, I didn’t really do anything, but I’m incredibly tired.’
My schedule until the next dungeon opened was just a royal meeting two days later.
Well, considering I’d just finished a long exploration, I planned to skip this one.  However…
‘Regardless of whether I go or not, I’m curious…’
What will the future hold?
In my experience, bad things always happen when I enter a dungeon during a time of unrest.
“Ugh…”
After a moment of pondering in the street, I decided to visit the administrative headquarters of Karnon and contact the sanctuary. I wanted to stay a few more days and attend the royal meeting before returning…
Bang-!
Leaving the administrative headquarters, I immediately boarded a carriage and headed to the dragon sanctuary.  I figured the dragon man might know something.
He had also subtly invited me to visit anytime.
I figured it would be more productive to spend time with the dragon man than to waste time resting.
‘…If I knew this, I should’ve asked him to take me along when we left…’
As usual, I was snoring away in my sleep when the carriage reached its destination.  Getting off the carriage and entering the dragon sanctuary was also trouble-free.
“Welcome, Baron Yandel.”
The dragonfolk doorkeeper must have gotten a heads up from the dragon man, because he didn’t even bother to confirm my identity before opening the door.
And then...
‘It’s a real pain to walk all this way.’
After climbing the mountain for a long time, I finally arrived at the dragonfolk sanctuary, specifically the dragon temple at its center.
“Hmm, I didn’t expect you to come right away.”
"Why? You said I could come anytime.  Were you just messing with me?"
"Honestly… If you were coming to see me, I thought you’d come after the royal meeting."
"We can’t live as long as you. We must make the most of every day."
“Make the most of every day…  Wise words indeed."
“Anyway.”
There wasn’t time for long introductions, and we had already covered them during the conference, so I got straight to the point.
"So… Is there anything you want to tell me? I had a feeling you had something to say."
"As I said earlier, I expected you to come after the royal meeting.  If you’d asked me for advice after hearing what transpired there, I’d have given you some."
“…Is something going to happen at the meeting?”
“It's not exactly an incident.  But it's something you'll hear about soon, so I might as well tell you in advance.”
The dragon man first revealed that he had two pieces of information before continuing.
“First, it’s about your marriage.”
“Marriage…?”
"The royal family wants to arrange a marriage for you with a human noblewoman."
Why is everyone so interested in my love life?
