## Chapter 706: Summoning Order (1)
The first thing I noticed upon returning to Noirk's underground fortress through the portal was the silence. 
“...”
“...”
Apart from the heavy breaths of my comrades, still reeling from the intense situation we had just escaped, everything was eerily quiet. 
Not even a single rat was visible in the fortress square that was supposed to be occupied by the Royal Guard. 
Frankly, it was a bit unexpected. 
Before entering the portal, Sven Parab, our human fate tracker, had been in such a state of panic that I had been worried something would erupt as soon as we arrived.
“A-a-ah... U-uh... A-ah…….”
He was still like this. 
“Snap out of it, Sven Parab.”
I approached him, but his trembling body showed no signs of stopping. 
While I watched, unsure how to handle the situation, a voice broke through the silence.
“…Are you okay? Mr. Parab, please try to calm down. Yes?” 
Lilith Marone, a mage of noble lineage who had joined our clan after our Ice Rock expedition, cautiously approached Sven and took his hand.
“Whatever it is, it’s going to be alright. Don’t be afraid. I’m here to protect you.”
It seemed futile in my eyes. 
There was no way he would calm down—
“A-a-ah… M-M-marone?”
Huh?
“I-I… M-M-Marone? Please, let, let, let go of my hand… for now…”.
…Could this actually be happening?
What was the difference between him and me?
“Oh! I’m sorry… I thought you looked cold, Mr. Parab…”.
“N-no! It’s alright. Please don’t apologize. I’m sorry…!”
Marone flustered, pulling her hand away, and an awkward silence fell between them.
“...”
“...”
What was going on with these two?
Were they like Rotmiller and Shavin Emure, in some kind of budding relationship? 
‘Well, seeing Marone, I don’t think so…’.
I couldn’t tell.
Romantic relationships were complicated, and to be honest, it wasn’t important to me what their relationship was.
The only thing that mattered was that Sven had finally come back to his senses.
“Parab, you’re awake, so get up. Stop acting like a complete mess.”
I pulled him up by the shoulders, and he managed to stand on his own, albeit with a shaky leg.
Okay, I think we can talk now.
“Is your intuition still as strong as ever?”
“Yes…”.
Hmph, then something big is definitely going to happen soon.
“…Alright, if anything changes, tell me immediately. I’ll be too busy, so you just stay behind me and catch up slowly.”
“…Sorry.”
I ended the conversation with Parab and called Amelia and Versil over.
“Do you know why there’s no one around? I thought the Royal Guard had taken over the area when you two left.”
“They did. We even had to secretly activate the magic circle to get out.”
“I don’t know either, Amelia. I have no idea why the Royal Guard withdrew.”
Hmm, is that so…?
I had even prepared what to say in case the Royal Guard was still there, but now there’s no need.
That’s at least a relief.
But I can’t shake this feeling of unease at not knowing why they withdrew.
“Yandel, so what are you planning to do?”
Amelia’s question made me pause for a moment.
Once again, there were two choices.
We could stay here in the underground fortress, hidden, waiting for things to settle down.
Or we could go back to the city and see what’s happening. 
Of course, my decision was already made.
“…We’re going back to the city.”
Closing our eyes wouldn’t change anything.
No matter how scared we are, we have to open our eyes and look ahead.
At least that way we’d know.
What to be afraid of.
Of course, hiding in a basement, covering our eyes and ears, could be an option, but it should be a decision made with full awareness of the situation.
Not just from fear.
“Which district are we going to?”
“We’ll start with the 7th district and then adjust based on the situation.”
We left the silent underground city and ascended to the sewers, the border between Noirk and Raphdonia.
We weren’t forming a battle formation focused solely on speed, but a formation that was more like the one used when entering a maze for the first time or moving through a known dangerous area.
“...”
“...”
No one spoke, but most of the members had questioning expressions.
‘Why are we being so cautious?’
It was a valid question, really.
From their perspective, we had simply gone outside the walls and now we’re back.
They must have found it strange to see me moving as if we were in a perilous situation.
Well, thanks to the trust I’ve built, they seem to think there must be some unspoken reason.
Kuu-uu-uu-ung-!
As we walked through the sewers, following Amelia who was leading the way, the ground and ceiling began to shake as if there had been an earthquake.
It wasn’t a particularly strong tremor, just a slight vibration, but it was enough to make the already tense faces of the members grow even more anxious.
“The tremors are coming from very far away.”
“…Is something really happening above the city?”
Their faces were no longer hesitant. Now they seemed to sense that things were getting serious.
It didn’t take long for things to get even worse.
“….Blood?”
A pool of crimson blood appeared on top of the sewer water.
And as we followed the trail, we found, of course, that….
“…Bodies.”
Bodies were scattered haphazardly in the sewers.
They didn’t seem to have been dead for too long…
Identifying them wasn’t difficult.
They seemed to have only brought the more expensive equipment, judging by the amount of supplies they left behind.
“These people… they’re from the Royal Guard.”
The Royal Guard was dead.
Here, in the sewers, in the territory of Raphdonia, even if it was a desolate area.
“Is there any possibility they were simply robbed by vagrants?”
No way. 
There was no chance that vagrants dared to attack the Royal Guard in the sewers. 
Therefore….
“Emily, keep guiding us. We need to get out of here as soon as possible.”
We increased our pace, leaving the Royal Guard bodies behind.
As we continued towards the exit, we saw more and more of their corpses.
However, the tremors that shook the sewers stopped after that first time. 
Hmm, what’s going on here?
“….It’s surprisingly quiet out here.”
Reaching the exit, we observed the outside, but couldn’t see much due to the limited angle.
Still, the street ahead was eerily quiet.
Not exactly reassuring, though.
Even if it was the outer edge, where the sewer entrance was located, there was no way a street would be deserted like this.
Especially in the middle of the day.
“…What are we going to do?”
“We’ll stay here for now. It’s too dangerous to move with this many people. Emily, can you take a few people with you and scout the area? Just come back with some information.”
“I don’t need anyone else. I prefer moving alone for this kind of thing.”
“It might be dangerous, though —.”
“I’m safer alone. If the situation is too dangerous, adding more people won’t change anything.”
Hmm, even though I’m worried, she’s a professional, so she must know what she’s doing.
“Alright. Please be careful. I don’t need much, so don’t push yourself.”
“…I’ll be back.”
With those words, Amelia made a few preparations before opening the sewer door and venturing out.
She moved so quickly and silently that I lost sight of her as soon as she stepped out.
I’m not sure about her answer to my request to be careful, but I decided to trust her and wait.
We had to use our time efficiently, after all.
“I sent a magical message to the clan house, but there’s no response.”
“That’s to be expected. I checked and there’s a magical wave blocking all magical communication throughout the city. I can’t even contact my remote video recorder back in my lab.”
“That explains it! I felt like the magic was being scattered in the middle.”
“Ah! I heard about those magical devices within the military. I thought they were used for exhibitions only… Oh, it seems there really is something happening in the city.”
“What happened while we were gone for two months?”
While Amelia was outside, we gathered as much information as we could.
And how much time passed?
Kii-i-i-k.
Amelia returned, opening the sewer gate.
She looked a bit tired, but her clothes showed no signs of battle or injury. 
But we had to be sure.
“Are you hurt?”
“…No, I’m fine. Don’t worry.”
Amelia smiled, answering my question, and then shared the information she had gathered.
“The walls are packed with soldiers using detection-type magical devices and abilities. I couldn’t get close to them. However, one thing’s for sure, something happened on the side of Bifron, which is now occupied by Noirk.”
“Bifron…?”
“You’ll see later, but the barrier covering Bifron was gone.”
“It seems… a war really has begun.”
“Probably. We found this in the clan house’s mailbox.”
Amelia handed me the letter she found in the clan house.
The seal showed that it was from the Royal Family. The wax seal had already been broken, meaning Amelia had already opened it.
“This is…”.
The letter’s content was long, as expected of a Royal Family decree.
But, summarizing it briefly…
“It’s a summoning order.”
“Yeah, it seems all the clans within the city have been summoned, not just us.”
“The city’s laws do state that, in the event of war, anyone capable of exploration or combat can be forcibly drafted into the military.”
Well, that’s to be expected.
What country goes to war with only regular soldiers?
As I was thinking this, Kaislan, a former member of the military, sighed heavily.
“However, the situation seems really serious. Even when the Noirkians invaded about a year ago, a summoning order was never issued.”
“Why not?”
“Issuing a summoning order would weaken the Royal Family’s authority. They need to be seen as absolute, and issuing an order like this implies they need help.”
Oh, is that so?
“In other words, if the Royal Family could handle it alone, a ‘summoning order’ would never be issued?”
“… I believe that’s a safe interpretation of the current situation.”
Kaislan’s words made me think a lot.
I sat silently, stroking my chin.
“This situation is getting complicated….  Miss Rains? Did you happen to see a decree addressed to the clan leader, not the clan itself, among the letters?”
“No, but… what’s so complicated?”
“Our clan leader is a titled noble, isn’t he? When a summoning order is issued, all titled nobles are transferred to the ‘Military Command Center’.”
“Military Command Center…?”
“Hmm, it’s a bit complicated to explain…”.
Kaislan struggled for a moment before organizing his thoughts and explaining as concisely as possible.
“As soon as we return to the city, our clan leader will be transferred to the ‘Military Command Center’ and stationed in the Imperial City.”
“And what about the Anabad Clan?”
“They will be assigned a task by the higher ups. Most likely the most dangerous front lines. And they’ll have to do it without the clan leader.”
In other words, we need to choose a new acting clan leader before we return to the city.
To return to the city.
