He closed his eyes and asked himself, "If this is the opening of a truly unkind game, what should I do now?" 
"First, assess the situation and gather information," he thought. 
His mind seemed to be returning to him, bit by bit.  Recalling his self-imposed first task, he slowly opened his eyes and surveyed his surroundings.  Sadly, nothing had changed.  He was still in a clearing in the woods. The flickering torches, not LED streetlights, illuminated the darkness around him.  Most importantly, muscular barbarians swarmed in every direction.
"Congratulations, young warriors!" 
"Damn, I wasn't imagining it," he muttered.  He wasn't sure what they were doing huddled together in the dead of night, but their expressions were solemn. The man in the middle, was he the chieftain?  It didn't matter. 
"From this day forward, you will leave the holy grounds and become true warriors!"
He closed his eyes again, ignoring the chieftain's words. Though not a doctor, he could diagnose himself with symptoms of a blackout. He had no idea why he was there.  
"Now, each of you step forward and choose a weapon that suits you!"
He had to figure this out.  What had he been doing just moments ago? He cautiously traced his memories, wondering if he had suffered some kind of brain damage.  He remembered.  He had been playing a game.  He was about to enter the final boss room, suppressing his excitement as he activated the portal.  Suddenly, a message flashed on the screen – "Tutorial complete," it read, followed by "Initiating transfer," and then, a blinding light erupted.  And then…?  
He had woken up here. 
His confusion had only deepened.
"The third son of Paroon, Karak, step forward!"
He decided to check his body first. He felt no pain, but there was always a chance…  He lowered his head, then froze.  What was this?
"A double-headed axe! Excellent choice!"
His hands were impossibly large,  and to his surprise, they moved according to his will.  He checked the rest of his body, and it was even more shocking. He was shirtless, and his muscular body was covered in tattoos of all shapes and sizes.  No wonder everyone seemed so tall. 
He tried to make sense of the situation.  Actually, there was nothing to make sense of.  He had somehow, without realizing it, become a barbarian.
"The third son of Paroon, Karak! You are now a warrior!"
Kidnapping? Hidden cameras? A psychological experiment?  He immediately dismissed these possibilities.  There was no point in clinging to hope and forcing explanations when the situation was so chaotic.  It was more productive to accept the reality of the situation.  What was happening to him was beyond the realm of science or modern knowledge.  This enormous body was just the tip of the iceberg.
"Next!"
First, the language the barbarians were using wasn't Korean, English, or Spanish. A language he had never encountered in any media, ever. The problem was that he understood it as if it were his native tongue. As if knowledge had been engraved in his mind.
"The second daughter of Frnellin, Ainarr, step forward!"
Second, he felt a strange familiarity with this situation. It might sound absurd, but it was true. Everything was strange at first, but when his mind cleared, he felt a distinct sense of déjà vu. 
"You chose a sword! A wise choice that suits you well!"
Young barbarians were choosing their weapons one by one. There was only one common factor among them…  It reminded him of the opening sequence of [Dungeon & Stone]. Specifically, the way the game started when you chose "Barbarian" from among the various races.  But could this be a mere coincidence?  The game he had been playing when that mysterious light enveloped him was [Dungeon & Stone], and the main character he had been playing was "Barbarian."
"The second daughter of Frnellin, Ainarr! You are now a warrior. May the blessing of 'Laphdonia' be with you!"
"This is crazy…"
He decided to stop trying to piece together the remaining evidence.  Laphdonia.  Just one proper noun, uttered by the chieftain moments ago, rendered everything meaningless.  He now knew where he was. In the world of the game he had played for nearly a decade.
"The, Dungeon & Stone."
"What, what is this? Why am I here…?"
He glanced at the barbarian next to him, and froze. Even to the casual observer, he was different from the other barbarians. His breath was ragged, and his eyes were filled with confusion.  He knew about [Dungeon & Stone], too.  Was he in the same predicament?  He felt a need to investigate, but unfortunately, he couldn't even attempt it.
"Who spoke just now?"
The deafening voice momentarily stunned him. It didn't last long, though.  He could see the chieftain looking down at him, and it brought him back to reality. 
"Was it you?"
He instantly shook his head, naturally turning to the barbarian beside him. He had to admit, it was a quick move.  The chieftain, instead of pressing him further, also turned his gaze to the barbarian next to him.  "Sorry, but it was you, wasn't it? You spoke."
"Was it you?"
"Yes?"
"I asked if you were the one who mumbled just now."
He only realized then that the chieftain's expression was serious.  It definitely wasn't just because of the mumbling…
"Ah, did you say 'Dungeon & Stone'? But… why?"
The guy seemed clueless about the atmosphere.
"It was you…."
The chieftain gritted his teeth, and a flicker of regret momentarily flashed in his eyes.  He felt a sense of inexplicable unease and unconsciously took a step back. 
The guy tilted his head, confused. "This must be like an event, right? Uh, maybe I figured it out too early—?"
He couldn't see what happened next, it all happened so fast. Something flashed, followed by a chilling sound.
"Shhhheeeek"
That was it.  Time seemed to stop, and then, the head that fell with a thud rolled away.  A scene of brutal violence, almost unreal. His eyes relayed the information they had just seen to his brain.
"…."
A man's head had been severed right before his eyes. He could see the bone, and the cross-section of the muscle. White something splashed on his face, along with blood and flesh. What was that? Fat?  He didn't know.  
It wasn't as shocking as he expected.  He didn't feel the urge to vomit, as he had seen in movies and cartoons.  He also didn't lose his mind, convincing himself that it was all a dream.
"Pshheeeew!"
He watched as blood sprayed from the man's neck, but only one question filled his mind.  Why did the chieftain kill him?
"The spirit of the son of Kadua, Orem, has been possessed by a 'demon.' Young warriors, erase all the words the demon uttered from your memories!"
As the chieftain spoke, information was automatically processed in his mind.  
Information 1: I am a demon.
Information 2:  If this is found out, I will die.
Information 3: I could have been the one beheaded.
As he reached this conclusion, a chill ran down his spine.  He had been perfectly calm even when the man's head was cut off. 
"Vulkan! Take the body and report this to the temple immediately!"
"What about the coming-of-age ceremony?"
"Proceed!"
The ceremony continued despite the bloodshed. It seemed like this was a common occurrence here. Nobody blinked, including the young warriors around him. 
Maybe it was because he had played so many unkind games?  He understood what he had to do, even though no one told him.
—Do not reveal to anyone that you are a demon.  Successfully complete the coming-of-age ceremony.
A friendly game would have displayed this message.
He imprinted his renewed task on his mind and forcefully stopped his body from trembling. He emulated the expressions of the others.  No one could sense anything amiss in him. To these people, he was nothing more than a 'demon' who had stolen their host's body.
"Next!"
His heart sank when the next accident occurred.
"The fourth son of Kenic, Serum, step forward!"
He didn't know his name. It was a matter of life or death. If he stood there alone after his name was called, he would surely arouse suspicion.
"Next!"
Of course, he could pretend he didn't hear it. That was certainly the more likely outcome.  But if he wasn't sure?  What if the chieftain asked him questions, suspecting him? He wouldn't be able to answer anything.
"Next!"
Was his anxiety messing with his brain chemicals?  Irrational optimism started to creep in.  "Maybe it doesn't matter if I don't know my name if I'm called last?" he thought weakly.
"Next!"
He felt ashamed of himself. Relying on luck?  He had never been lucky in his life.  Just the fact that he was dragged here from a game was enough to prove that.  He needed a plan with a much higher chance of success for him to survive this crisis.
"Next!"
He continued to observe his surroundings for that reason.  He kept his chin raised, but with his eyes, he scanned the expressions, movements, and habits of the other barbarians.  As he did so, an idea came to him.
"Next!"
Of course, this method didn't guarantee a 100% success rate.  But time was short, and he made a final decision.  This was the path with the highest chance of survival.
"Next!"
"Next!"
"Next!"
The calls continued.  He counted to two in his head each time.  He had done this eight times when—
"The son of Yandel, Bjorn, step forward!"
The moment he had been waiting for finally arrived.  Two seconds passed after his name was called, and no one moved.  As soon as he realized this, he took a step forward. He stood tall, shoulders back, and walked towards the chieftain.
"Thump."
He wasn't fearless. Even now, as he took those steps, he wasn't certain that this was his name.
"Thump."
If he was wrong, the insane chieftain would call him out, suspecting him. He would ask, "Who is your mother?"  He wouldn't be able to answer.
But…
"Thump."
He didn't hesitate. His heart pounded, but he continued to move forward, taking deep breaths.  It was simple. He had decided this was the most likely option.
"Young warrior, choose the weapon you desire!"
He had made the right choice.  The chieftain looked at him, and there was no hint of suspicion in his eyes. The same gentle gaze he had used when he had looked at the other young warriors.  He suppressed a strange surge of excitement and caught his breath.  He had survived.
***
He had been awake for less than ten minutes, but he had come to terms with the reality he faced. Others might think he was strange, but… there was no point in denying it. This wasn't a dream.  
"Bjorn Yandel."
He would have to live under this name.  No, he would have to become this barbarian completely.  He didn't know how long it would last.  Could he go back home? And if he could, what would he have to do?  He didn't know anything. 
Maybe he could go back if he met the game's clear conditions.  But it was too early to say for sure.  To be honest, he hoped it wasn't true.  No, he had never even cleared the 2D version of the game, so how could he possibly clear it in reality?  He might have to live here forever.
"…."
In that sense, his choice of weapon was crucial.  He thought it would arouse suspicion if he dragged things out, but he carefully examined each weapon.  A one-handed sword, a double-handed greatsword, a mace, a warhammer, a spear, a trident, a double-headed axe, a flail, a giant hammer, and so on. Bows and staves were not even available.  These barbarian bastards didn't even think about easy jobs like healers, mages, or archers.  It was only natural, given their racial characteristics.
"The son of Yandel, Bjorn! Choose your weapon quickly!"
The chieftain began to urge him as his selection time grew longer. He thought it over for the last time.  Barbarians had no innate magical talent, but they had incredible physical abilities.  That's why he had always given his barbarians melee weapons and placed them in the front lines.  He had even tried using a bow-wielding barbarian out of curiosity, but it wasn't very good.  Their true worth was always revealed in close combat.  And among those…
"This."
He chose his weapon after careful consideration. 
"Hmm."
The chieftain, who had always expressed admiration and praise after each selection, was surprised for the first time. He could understand the chieftain's feelings.
"The son of Yandel, Bjorn! You are now a warrior!"
He had chosen a weapon that no one else had chosen.
***
At that moment, in a dark room where the flash had subsided, the system beeped.
"Synchronization complete."
"Character information and log being recorded and sent to the administrator."
The fan in the computer that had been off started to spin, and light from the monitor illuminated the empty room.  However, the boot-up process was not working properly.
"Beep beep beep beep beep…"
The screen froze on a black background DOS screen, and typing filled the screen, accompanied by beeps, as if it were some kind of error message.
"Coming-of-age ceremony successfully completed."
"New equipment has been equipped."
"Total item level increased by +12…."
"…."
As if someone were writing in real time, the sounds echoed softly through the unmanned room. 
"Bjorn Yandel"
Level: 1
Strength: 25 /  Mind: 35 /  Magic: 1 
Item Level: 24 (New +24)
Total Combat Index: 67 (New +6)
