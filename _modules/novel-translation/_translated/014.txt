## Chapter 14: Return (1)
The moment Erwen raised her bow, her face taut with tension, I shoved her forward.
"Eh?"
Thrown off balance, she stumbled forward, her body colliding with the ethereal essence floating in the air.
Swoosh!
The essence pulsed with light, swirling into Erwen's body.
"Damn, what a crazy bastard!"
So, their plan was this all along.
"Don't move! I told you to stay still!"
The four-member explorer party had arrived just ten meters away.
But what could we do?
The essence was already hers.
Maintaining an imposing presence, I took a step forward, avoiding any sign of nervousness.
"Why should I listen to you?"
"That essence was ours!"
I pictured what would have happened if Erwen hadn't absorbed the essence. They would have demanded it, resorting to any excuse imaginable. They would have claimed we had stolen it from afar, or that we had hunted the goblin with arrows.
"If you want to fight, then fight. I'll gladly face you."
Four against two.
Despite our numerical disadvantage, I met their challenge head-on. It was similar to a small dog barking aggressively: I was trying to avoid a fight at all costs. Humans are like beasts—if you underestimate them, they'll bite.
"..."
The red-haired leader of the group gritted his teeth, silent.
Well, of course, he was thinking.
If the essence had remained in the air, it might have been different. 
But its owner was already decided. There was nothing to gain by fighting us. It would be wiser to simply give up and leave—
"...We demand compensation."
Was he going to whine?
The essence had vanished before their eyes, leaving them desperate.
While I had no reason to consider their request, I replied, "We obtained the essence ourselves, why do you claim any compensation?"
"Do you have proof? We hunted that goblin."
I didn't bother asking, "What proof do you have?"
It was obvious; they had none.
There weren't any security cameras in the labyrinth.
Ultimately, the strongest one's words would be the truth.
"I repeat, if you want to fight, then fight. I will not back down."
I remained resolute.
If they wanted to fight, then let them. But if they wanted to talk, then they should just leave.
I didn't give them time to think.
"We'll give you three. If you don't make your decision by then, we'll consider you an enemy."
"Ah, sir…?"
Why couldn't she understand the situation?
Just be quiet. You see how scared they are by my assertiveness?
"Three."
"Two."
"We'll retreat."
He made his decision before I reached one.
I mean, I would have done the same if I saw a heavily tattooed, imposing barbarian counting down. 
If it had truly been theirs, they would have been burning with anger, seeking revenge. 
But they knew better.
Soon, they disappeared from our sight.
"Gone?"
"Yes, it seems so."
"I'll increase our pace until we reach the portal. Lead the way."
Erwen didn't object, blazing a trail through the labyrinth with her swift movements.
She sensed it too.
While we had avoided bloodshed, it wasn't over yet.
"Do you sense their presence?"
"I don't feel them. But, sir, there's a group of goblins at three o'clock. What should we do?"
"Ignore them."
"Yes."
My original plan was to leisurely hunt goblins on our way back. But now, my plan had changed.
We would leave the second floor as quickly as possible.
And when we reach the first floor, we would keep as far away from the portal as we could.
Erwen tilted her head, confused, "Surely they won't follow us to the first floor?"
"They're not following. We just happen to be going the same way."
"What do you mean?"
It was a simple assumption.
They had formed a party of four.
And four would be enough to explore the second floor's entrance. Yet, instead of venturing out to the periphery, they were moving towards the entrance.
The intention was clear.
"They probably planned to descend to the first floor and return to the city on the seventh day. That's why we encountered them here, at this time."
"Ah..."
In other words, they were just like us, lurking on the second floor.
They were outnumbered by two, yet they were scared of me and ran away.
They might not even be a proper party, perhaps just a group formed by chance on the first floor.
"I see..."
Erwen nodded silently, although I couldn't tell if she fully understood.
"You really are amazing, sir!"
...Didn't you get it?
"I'll do whatever you tell me, sir!"
Well, maybe this is better.
Those who try to be clever often end up causing more trouble.
"Sir, goblins!"
"Avoid them."
"But I think they saw us. They're running towards us!"
"What?"
Instinct took over, making me feel uneasy.
Since the fourth day, goblins had never noticed us first. 
Erwen's perception was impeccable.
It couldn't just be a coincidence, even if we were running and moving faster than before.
Especially since she had absorbed the essence.
"We'll take a detour, in the opposite direction."
"Yes!"
Erwen changed directions on my command.
And then.
Whiz!
An arrow flew from the direction we had just turned from.
I saw it and immediately pulled Erwen by the back of her neck.
"Keck!"
Erwen gasped, her windpipe constricted, but...
It was better to be choked for a moment.
Than to be pierced.
Bang!
The arrow bounced off my shield as I pulled her in and protected my upper body.
Even though it missed, it was heavy.
Was it that crossbow guy from before?
"I, I... can dodge, I can…."
Erwen coughed, trying to speak.
But there was no time to listen.
"I… was…."
"Just run."
I once again put Erwen in front and started to run.
"Sir, if another arrow comes, you don't have to pull me like that…"
"Shut up. I'm thinking."
I lowered my voice, and Erwen shut her mouth.
I continued thinking as I ran, keeping an eye on my surroundings.
I didn't know how they did it, but they had lured the goblins. Now, they were ambushing us from the opposite direction, trying to trap us.
Could we escape and reach the portal?
'Not likely.'
I weighed the possibility, but I judged it to be extremely low.
There was a crossbow guy.
And the goblins were chasing us.
We might survive if we were lucky...
But I wasn't that lucky.
"We have to fight."
I needed a few breaths to recover. 
I made my decision in that time.
"Erwen, use your ability."
"Ability?"
"I mean, use the power of the essence."
Each monster drops an essence that contains a part of their unique abilities.
For example,
[Goblin Archer]
Agility+2 Flexibility+4 Sight+6 Smell+2 Perception+2 Awareness Disruption+6 Accuracy+8 Poison Resistance+4 Obsession+7
(P) Poison Arrow – Inflicts poison damage when using bow-like weapons.
(A) Sneak Step – Enters stealth mode.
This is how it's displayed in the game.
Increased stats and one passive skill, one active skill.
This information is likely applied in this world too.
Although there were some variables like the evil spirit and the start point, this aspect has always been consistent with the game.
"B, but I don't know how to use it…"
I smiled as I saw Erwen panic at my seemingly unreasonable demand.
"It's working."
"Working?"
"I mean, you're stealthy."
Erwen's body shimmered as she ran.
It was still visible from a distance, but only faintly.
"Stop."
Her stealth intensified as she stopped running. 
That's why the character moved so slowly in the game. As she stood still, her form became translucent, almost completely invisible.
It was still possible to sense a clear discrepancy in the outline, but it would be invisible at close range.
Especially in a dark forest like this.
"Wow..."
Erwen exclaimed, admiring her own body.
I felt the same wonder.
We might be different in terms of points.
But it wasn't a keyword, the skill triggered by intention.
Anyway, we'll study this more later.
"Erwen, take this."
"Yes?"
I handed Erwen my backpack.
And then I spoke in rapid succession.
"Hide here and when I signal, shoot the crossbow guy first. Absolutely do not do anything before I signal. Got it?"
"What are you talking about…?"
"There's no time. Consider it understood."
I immediately started running, rushing to finish my instructions.
"Wait, signal! How do I signal—!"
I heard her faint cry from behind, but I couldn't turn back. The risks were too high.
Thump.
I stopped running about thirty meters from my original location.
I wasn't planning on going far.
If I kept running like this and stepped on a trap in the bushes, it would be a big problem.
"Gruk gruk!"
Turning around, I sensed a group of goblins approaching from the front left.
And those bastards...
I couldn't tell where they were yet.
They were blocking our first step, but hadn't revealed themselves yet.
But I wasn't too worried.
I knew exactly what they were planning.
"Gruk, gruk!"
They would reveal themselves if we fought the goblins.
That was their plan all along.
Returning to the present, I scanned the approaching goblins.
"Grrrr!!"
Among the dozen goblins, two were swordsmen.
Luckily, there were no archers in the goblin group—
Bang!
There they were.
I charged towards the goblins, parrying an arrow with my shield.
Of course, I couldn't go wild like before.
We had to be wary of the goblin archer, as well as the human crossbow guy.
Bang!
Another arrow flew after a ten-second pause.
It was the goblin archer's.
Bang!
I blocked the arrow with my shield and smashed the goblin swordsman's skull.
As a result, I was slightly stabbed in the leg by another goblin, but...
Whoosh.
It couldn't be helped.
This level of risk was inevitable.
They wouldn't reveal themselves unless the goblins were eliminated.
Thump! Thump! Thump!
As I went into full-blown barbarian mode, taking down goblins, I began to accumulate injuries.
Forearm, thigh, side, and so on.
None of them were serious, but the accumulation was undeniable.
Thump!
A tingling sensation spread from my injuries, as if poison was starting to take effect.
But I endured, and after I killed seven goblins...
Whiz!
An arrow flew.
Two at the same time.
Whiz!
The arrows came from different directions.
One would be the goblin archer's, and the other, the crossbow guy's.
It was impossible to block both.
I chose to block the crossbow guy's arrow, which was coming from the side.
Bang!
The weight was different, even the sound was different, compared to the goblin archer's.
So, this was the power of a crossbow?
As I thought about it, a goblin arrow pierced my left elbow with a *fwoosh* sound.
"Shit."
It hurt.
Did it hit the bone? It hurt, but my arm wouldn't move at all.
Damn, I tried to deflect it with the shoulder guard, but it was harder than I thought.
Thump.
I discarded my hammer without hesitation.
And took up the shield in my useless left hand. If I had to choose between a hammer and a shield, the shield was the best option.
Especially in a situation like this.
Thump! Thump! Thump!
I beat down the remaining three goblins with the shield in my hand, clearing the area for now.
The goblin archer must have escaped, as the arrows stopped.
A victory with injuries, but I'd endured.
I shouted, "Come out! You bastards!"
I never thought I'd say that to a human, not a goblin.
But, what's the difference?
Whiz!
The bastards didn't come out, but an arrow flew from afar.
It was the human crossbow guy's.
I blocked it, no problem.
But...
Bang!
Damn, what the hell.
The arrow pierced the iron plate and its tip was sticking out.
If I'm not careful, my other hand will be ruined too!
I shielded my upper body with the shield and scanned the bushes. Soon, I heard footsteps.
"Barbarian."
Three figures emerged.
The red-haired leader.
The samurai with a katana.
A lanky guy with a one-handed sword and shield.
The crossbow guy was still nowhere in sight.
"It was you, after all."
"Yeah, it was us."
I didn't ask questions like, "How did you lure the goblins?"
That would only make them look down on me even more.
"Fight."
"So, you are a barbarian? You're full of energy even after fighting all those goblins alone. Where's that elf chick?"
He had been talking so much, so this was his goal all along.
"You think I'm going to give you the backpack and the elf because you're afraid I might be hurt? Speak up if you want to know."
I laughed involuntarily as I heard his words.
He thinks I'll just give him the backpack and the elf if he asks nicely? Who does he think I am, a fool?
"Crazy bastard."
The leader furrowed his brow, seeing me laughing.
His expression was a mixture of boredom and annoyance.
He probably saw me as a typical barbarian.
"We'll capture you first, and then ask you slowly."
The leader exchanged glances with his comrades, and they all slowly approached.
Capture me...
I was glad to hear it.
After all, killing me wouldn't be profitable.
There must have been a reason for their surprise attack.
It could be because of the magic stones we had collected over the past seven days, the equipment we were wearing, Erwen's beautiful appearance, and seeing someone else's good fortune.
I realize this again now.
"Don't let your guard down. Think of it as hunting a large monster."
There are too many efficiency freaks in this world.
That's why I grew up like this.
Swish.
I slowly raised my hand.
The arrow was lodged in my elbow, and the poison had taken effect, making my left arm numb. But I forced my hand up to my head.
And…
"What are you doing?"
I raised my middle finger high.
Whiz!
To signal something that would be recognized as unique to anyone who had lived in this world.
Fwoosh-!
A chilling sound resonated throughout the forest.
