## Chapter 414: Unbreakable Ties (4)
62 days into the labyrinth’s entrance, Dragon’s Heart.
As we approached the portal leading to the 8th floor, only 30 minutes away, a signal flashed from the traffic light ring.
“The ring has detected a character's fate.”
The ring's light illuminated, a vibrant red.
“Sir, it’s red!”
A negative event lurks ahead, is that it?
I had assumed there’d be some green mixed in, but it’s all red.
Depressing.
“…What do we do? Should we change course now?”
Erwen muttered anxiously.
In the past, whenever the ring lit red or Sven Parav’s intuition flared, we would immediately change direction to avoid the event.
But…
“Erwen, changing our destination now won’t change anything.”
“Well… that’s true, but…”
Flames engulf the entire area, blazing red.
Even if we try to escape, the flames will engulf us, closing in and suffocating us.
There’s only one way to escape these flames.
We must push forward, before it’s too late, risking everything to overcome them.
“Parav, what’s wrong?”
Goblin, who’d been beside me, hesitantly stammered.
“I… I feel safer next to the captain.”
‘Safer, huh.’ I was a bit offended, but I let it go.
He’d been a great help all this time.
“So, how are you feeling now?”
“I’m suffocating. It’s like walking into a burning forest.”
“Really? But you’ve been awfully quiet. You always insisted we run away.”
“I do feel an ominous presence, but I also feel like this is the right path.”
He’s right, of course.
“The portal is just ahead. Everyone, speed up!”
I pushed myself forward.
After what seemed like an eternity…
“There it is, the portal!”
In the distance, the portal shimmered, radiating vibrant colors.
And…
“…Enemies!”
The portal’s light illuminated our surroundings, revealing the enemy.
A detachment of around 40.
They were also approaching the portal.
“Those Royal bastards!”
“They really came this way!”
They spotted us just as we spotted them, shouting in alarm.
How did they know to come here?
As I wondered, a familiar face caught my eye.
“You…!!”
The Dragon Slayer, Regal Bagos.
“Of course, I knew you’d come this way!”
As much as I know you, you must know something about me, too.
What a persistent, twisted connection…
“Running away like a rat ends here!”
What a nerve, they just got here themselves.
Anyone would think they completely blocked our path.
‘I’m glad we decided to speed up.’
I was proud of my judgment from 20 minutes ago.
If we had hesitated even slightly when the ring glowed red, they would’ve already blocked our way.
There would’ve been a devastating loss of life.
“Don’t hesitate! Run!”
I pushed myself beyond my last burst of energy, using all my strength to move my legs.
The situation is simple.
The expeditionary team is heading east towards the portal.
The Dragon Slayer and his friends… the Dragon Slayer’s Legion, for short… are heading north towards the portal.
“Run! Run! Run! Run! Run!”
Whichever side reaches the portal first gains a huge advantage.
Does the other side know this too?
The Dragon Slayer’s Legion was also running desperately, closing the distance to the portal.
But…
‘Good. We’re faster.’
We’re closer to the portal, as anyone can see.
“Damn it, what are you all doing! Attack!”
The Dragon Slayer’s Legion started launching long-range attacks to hold us back.
They had the numbers to do it.
They decided to keep the long-range casters, who needed time to cast, as a deterrent, while their melee types would secure the portal.
Whizz-bang! Boom-!
Thud-thud-thud-thud-thud.
Damn, feels like we’re on a real battlefield.
Arrows and magical attacks rain down from the sky.
“What are you waiting for! Move faster! You’re dead if you fall behind!”
“I, my legs…!”
“Damn it, I’m going crazy! Dammit, get on my back!”
“But…”
“Now!”
I could push through this AoE damage with just my bare body, but not everyone could.
“Kuh-!”
One of our members was wounded by a stray arrow.
And…
“Just hold on! I’ll get you healed soon!”
Another member took the injured comrade and pushed forward.
‘Damn it, at this rate, we’ll lose a few more people here.’
I clenched my jaw as I felt that thought seep in.
A shadowy figure with a feminine outline appeared above us, as we ran.
“Erwen Fornaci di Tercia is summoning [Dicloe, the Dark Spirit King].”
The strongest summoned beast, who’d given me the name Blood Spirit King.
Dicloe, the Dark Spirit King.
Dicloe unleashed a massive dark sphere at the enemy.
Boom-boom-boom-boom-boom-BOOM-!
Even Akuraba, a heavy damage dealer, couldn’t unleash such overwhelming power.
However, its duration is correspondingly short.
Its active time, when unleashing maximum power, is about 5 seconds.
But 5 seconds was enough.
“Run!”
“We’ll be fine, you go first!”
The Dragon Slayer’s Legion was halted, trying to block the counterattack, and one by one, starting with the leading group, we pushed through the portal.
And…
BOOM-!
Dicloe, having unleashed its final dark sphere, was recalled, and Erwen staggered.
“Sir, you’re here…”
“Of course, I wouldn’t leave you behind.”
“…Right. Because you’re our sir.”
“Good work.”
Everyone else had already ascended to the 8th floor, except for us two.
I scooped up Erwen, who’d collapsed from exhaustion, and ran towards the portal.
After what felt like only a few moments…
“Think you can get away!”
The voice came from right behind us, close enough to feel.
Definitely fast for a civilian.
When did he even get here?
Well, he’s already too late, though.
Thud.
As I slid forward, the portal’s light enveloped me, warm and welcoming.
“Entered the 8th floor, the Land of Dawn.”
When I opened my eyes, I saw the members waiting for me, right in front of the portal.
“C, Captain.”
They lowered their weapons, relieved to see me.
But that relief was short-lived.
“T, the portal is glowing!”
They grabbed their weapons again, the moment I stood up.
Naturally, our expeditionary team had all entered.
It’s obvious who just came through.
‘Damn, they’re going to follow us this far.’
Are they fearless, or are they just crazy?
Either way, there’s no need to be scared.
What did we run so hard for?
“Prepare for combat!”
“Kill them all!”
“Wow, they’re here.”
“Kill…!”
Blocking the entrance is invincible.
***
I stand before the portal.
Or rather, I stand guard before it.
With a hammer in one hand and a shield in the other.
“….”
Our members, ready to unleash their skills and swing their weapons.
“…It’s unnervingly quiet.”
Over an hour has passed since we blocked the portal.
The only time this portal spat out enemies was right after I entered the 8th floor, when the Dragon Slayer and his underlings arrived.
‘I wish we could’ve killed him then.’
I killed eight of his men, but unfortunately, I missed the Dragon Slayer.
He abandoned his men, ditching the lot, and ran back to the 7th floor.
Since then, we’ve been stuck like this.
Like the calm before the storm.
‘They’ll likely charge in all at once, once they’ve gathered enough troops.’
By then, blocking the entrance won’t matter. Not that I ever intended to block it forever, of course.
All I wanted was time to regroup.
Just like this.
“Shuyts, the injured are all healed.”
“Food and supplies?”
“We’ve gathered everything we have and need, and loaded them on the sleds.”
In other words, we’re ready to enter the Ice Rock at a moment’s notice.
But I decided to push ourselves a little further.
“We’ll take this entrance, everyone take turns resting.”
“…Very well.”
Kailslan immediately arranged for the most exhausted members to rest, and Akuraba approached me.
“Don’t you think we should leave soon? It’s dangerous to stay here.”
The air is calm, but Akuraba’s expression is grim.
Her gaze keeps darting towards the rear, revealing her anxiety.
It’s obvious what she’s worried about.
“…Shuyts, you know it’s only a matter of time before they return.”
Noark’s elite squad, who are currently in the 8th floor rift.
If they clear the rift and come out, we’ll be surrounded on both sides.
‘But for now, we’re lucky.’
What I’m most concerned about is if Noark’s elite squad happened to be waiting for us when we arrived on the 8th floor.
It’s like being struck by lightning on a clear day, an extremely unlikely probability, but it’s a possibility we can’t ignore.
‘The problem is, we have no idea when they’ll return.’
It’s like lying on a random death trap, with no escape.
If we’re unlucky, they’ll emerge from the rift right now, and it’ll be the end for us.
But…
“We’ve been on the move for days, with barely any sleep. If we enter the Ice Rock in this condition, we’ll be wiped out before we go far.”
There’s no other choice.
Akuraba, recognizing this, accepted and walked away.
About 12 hours later.
WHISSHHH-!
The portal flickered and spat out one Noark explorer.  Undressed and unprepared, the explorer was instantly killed by the force guarding the entrance.
“Only one…?”
“…A scout, then.”
It’s a typical Noark move.
If the scout dies, it means we’re still guarding the entrance, and if he survives, he’ll deliver the message.
‘But even Noark won’t keep sending people like that.’
After some deliberation, I made a decision.
The next scout should come within an hour or three.
And we’ve all had a minimum rest.
“Everyone, gather your things, get up and get dressed!”
We have 13 days left until the labyrinth closes.
“We’re entering the Ice Rock!”
It’s time for the final chapter.
***
The Land of Dawn, 8th floor.
A peaceful place, with lush green meadows and hills.
However, the atmosphere was far from peaceful.
The stench of blood emanating from the explorers filling the area.
“Say it again. Keilelbad Gener. What did you just say?”
“Give up, Bagos. We’ve already lost them.”
“What!”
The Dragon Slayer immediately lunged forward, grabbing Gener by the throat, but the man remained silent.
“Even if you shout, nothing changes.  Going after them unprepared into the Ice Rock is suicide.”
“What are you saying! We outnumber them, and if they can do it, we can too, right?”
“You say that because you don’t know the Ice Rock.  Numbers mean nothing in the Ice Rock. They’re just an impediment to movement.”
“….”
“If you’re wondering if we should just go in with our elite team, that’s dangerous too. They’ve only managed to run away so far because they were surrounded by enemies.”
“You’re saying we’ll get ambushed if we follow them?”
“Yes. They… especially that captain of theirs, he’s an absolute monster—”
The man answered resolutely, even when faced with the Dragon Slayer’s furious questioning. And in an instant, his throat was grasped.
“Kuh-!”
“You useless bastard.”
The Dragon Slayer’s eyes were filled with nothing but murderous intent as he tightened his grip.
Did he not expect the Dragon Slayer to actually kill him, even with his reckless nature?
The man, his throat choking, hastily spoke again.
“If, if the captain finds out—”
“The captain, that damn captain.”
“Kuh-!”
“If the captain had to choose between you and me, who do you think he’d choose?  Think he’d kill me for killing you?”
“No, I… .”
The flow of blood to his head stopped, and the man’s body went limp. If this continued for a few more seconds, he’d surely die.
But…
“Spit.”
The Dragon Slayer threw the man to the ground carelessly, then spat.
He was enraged by the man’s audacity, but he couldn’t kill him.
He’s useful, aside from his tendency to talk too much.
That’s why the captain seems to care so much for him.
“Damn it.”
His fist clenched, even after his outburst.
The other subordinates looked at him, afraid, but Regal Bagos’ mind remained cold.
‘…This guy’s not entirely wrong.’
We can’t force our way through with just numbers, following them blindly is dangerous.
They’d be fine if they were all at his level, but even the elite team is full of trash, except for this guy who just fainted.
If I push myself too hard and end up needing to use a Dragon’s Word, my barely-healed body will be ruined, and I might need to rest for months.
‘The captain will also make a huge fuss about it.’
It’s clearly a losing situation.
But…
‘So I’m just supposed to let this guy go, the one I could eat alive?’
He couldn’t stand it.
Not just a matter of his feelings, but a gut feeling borne of experience. It was the same in Larkaz’s Maze.
[You know why you always lose money? You just bet the amount you need at the time.  Even in a situation demanding a gamble.]
He’d conceded one thing at a time, to avoid losing, until it finally came to this. His body was ruined, and he lost his memories, spending over a year as a semi-invalid.
And now, I’m just supposed to let this guy go?
The more he calmly analyzed the situation, the more the scale tipped towards the ‘no’ side.
It wasn’t just about revenge anymore.
‘This guy has gotten so strong in just that time.’
How would he be if we met again?
He destroyed the Celestial Eye, and he’s bound to get a huge reward from the Royals when he returns.
What if he gets even stronger here?
Would I be able to beat him then?
Regal Bagos made his decision.
‘…I have to do it now.’
He can’t afford to wait.
He must end his twisted connection with this man, no matter the cost.
It’s the smart choice.
Clench.
He’d just made his decision.
As if the heavens themselves were cheering him on.
WHISSHHH-!
A warm spring breeze swirled around him, gathering into a vortex of light.
It meant only one thing.
“…A rift! The rift is opening!”
Noark’s elite squad, secretly trained and nurtured.
They say they don’t even eat Essence under Rank 4?
There’s even a rumor circulating Noark that a generational change within Orculist will happen once they become active…
‘Lucky bastards, born at the right time.’
That’s how the Dragon Slayer viewed them.
Naturally, everyone else toiled from the 1st floor, but these guys got all the support because they had potential and a lot of Essence to use.
‘Well, good for them.’
The Dragon Slayer smiled, though a part of him was envious, and stepped forward.
Soon, a portal opened, and the squad appeared, worn and weary as if they’d fought a grueling battle.
“You are… Regal Bagos? What brings you here?”
The Dragon Slayer smiled, his eyes gleaming, as he answered.
“The Celestial Eye is destroyed.”
“…What? The Celestial Eye?”
“And the one who shattered it is running away towards that Ice Rock.”
“But why are we—”
“It’s the captain’s orders.  Lead these men in pursuit.”
