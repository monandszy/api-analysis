## Chapter 23: Level Up (3)
I insert the torch into the groove etched on my helmet and secure it with a strap. The so-called Barbarian Candle Mode. It fills me with self-loathing, but it's a practical method used by many explorers.
Einar holds out his hand to the flickering flames and then exclaims in astonishment.
"Oh, this is incredible! It's not hot at all!"
Well, this torch is a magical item, after all. It's only about a hand span long, so it doesn't hinder my movements, and it lasts for three days once lit. It was an explorer's tool that the crossbow party carried. 
Was the average market price 10,000 stones? 
Suddenly, I miss Erwen.
"Where are we, anyway?"
Einar asks, looking around, as if his surroundings are finally coming into focus. There's a huge disparity between seeing something in person and on a 2D pixelated screen, but this time it's pretty easy to understand. The black earth squelches with each step. We see the remnants of stone buildings scattered everywhere. We can faintly hear mournful cries coming from the distance.
"This is the Land of the Dead."
"Ah, so this is where ghouls and Deathspins appear!"
That's more or less right. Technically, Elder Ghouls, Skeletons, Banshees, and even Durahan, a kind of mid-boss, appear here.
"I'll take the lead."
The monsters' combat power is much higher in the Land of the Dead than in the Goblin Forest. But if I had to choose which was more difficult, I'd say the Goblin Forest. This place is much darker, but at least there are no traps. This is a much more convenient place for two barbarians to operate.
"A ghoul."
We soon encounter a monster. The number is small—only three. But in three days, there will be about three times as many. That gives us one more reason to move quickly.
"Bjorn, there's a magic stone here!"
"Don't bother reporting it to me. Just collect everything you see. We can sort it out later. I'll speed things up."
Unlike the Goblin Forest, I immediately leave the starting area and continue moving north. 
Just then, I hear a scream from nearby.
"Kyaaah!"
"Bjorn, Bjorn?"
"It's a Banshee's howling. Just ignore it. It rarely attacks first."
"I, I see… But are you sure we can't just kill it? It might be dangerous."
Well.
If Erwen, who could summon spirits, were here, it wouldn't be a problem. But for two physical-damage dealers, there's nothing we can do to kill a Banshee. And even if we could, it would be a problem.
"If you attack a Banshee first, you'll be cursed."
"Cursed?"
"It's a curse called Sign of Grudge. Banshees will relentlessly pursue you until you leave the maze."
If we're not just hunting Banshees for the next ten days, it's best to avoid them altogether. If you're after experience, it's customary to only kill a few on the last day.
"You're a truly wise warrior. I'm glad I followed you."
It's nice to get compliments.
Although I try not to show it, I know you're pretty scared of this kind of thing. But that's that, and this is this.
"Kyaaah!"
"Clack!"
Please stop clinging to me every time you hear that sound. It's not just unsettling…
My captured arm feels like it's going to shatter.
"Let go, let go... It's a skeleton."
As if on cue, a group of skeletons appears with the rattling sounds of their joints dislocating. The number is a whopping ten. True to their reputation for being the monster with the most numbers, even on day one, they are quite numerous. 
Well, for that many, only three or four magic stones will drop, anyway.
"Ahem! I'll take care of them!"
As if embarrassed by his fear of the Banshee, Einar rushes forward. 
Tsk tsk, I click my tongue in my mind.
"Einar! If you look between the ribs, you'll see its core. If you try to kill a skeleton with a sword, you must target that area..."
Crack!
"Huh? What did you say?"
"Nothing. Just fight."
Crack! Crack! Crack!
Core? Weakness? 
With every swing of his massive broadsword, Einar completely obliterates the skeletons. 
And they never get up again.

*You killed an Elder Ghoul. EXP +1.*
*You killed a Skeleton. EXP +1.*
*You killed a Skeleton Warrior. EXP +1.*
*You killed a Skeleton Archer. EXP +1.*
***
We continue to move north for about eight hours. We naturally encounter several new monsters along the way. Elder Ghouls are about twice the size of regular Ghouls. Skeleton Warriors and Archers are classified as variants.  It's hard to say anything about the mages, as I haven't encountered them yet, but so far nothing has been too difficult.  This is because the population is small, and my combat power has increased significantly compared to before.
Bang!
Even just looking at my equipment, you can see the difference. The old man's two-handed hammer was forced to be held with a short grip because of the center of gravity.  But now, with a mace about 70 cm long, I can hit from a longer range.  It's much safer, and it has more power. 
And more importantly...
Clang!
I even got armor. It's a plate vest, so my forearms are exposed, but even that reduces the number of areas I have to block with my shield. This allows for much bolder combat. It's like I've finally shed my shackles.
"Bjorn, be careful! There are also Skeleton Archers!"
The steel helmet, with only eyes, nose, and mouth exposed in a T shape, protects my most crucial point: my head.  Of course, it would be dangerous if a crossbow hit me directly, but it easily deflects arrows shot from broken bows.
And there's another barbarian with a similar combat power to me.
"Behel—laaaaa!"
We roar the names of the barbarian ancestors together, continuing a slaughter that's not far off.
Bang! Bang! Crack!
No matter what monster comes out, it takes only about ten seconds to obliterate the entire pack.
Maybe that's why?
Every time the battle ends, I feel a refreshing feeling I never experienced when I was with Erwen. 
Ah, is this the true taste of being a barbarian?
"Bjorn, you're injured."
Huh?
I check Einar's words and see a slight scratch on my forearm. 
But...
"Don't worry. It'll heal quickly."
I don't even need potions or herbs.
"Oh! It's already healing! Is this the power of the Soul Mark?"
The first stage of the Immortal Mark path significantly increases natural regeneration. 
Of course, it's no match for potions…
I checked it before.  It took about a minute for a 0.5 cm deep wound to heal somewhat. But that alone significantly increases stability. My health recovery itself is also faster, which has increased my stamina enormously.
"Get ready. We're almost there."
I lower our speed, putting Einar on edge.
The terrain has changed. The ground is no longer muddy, but hard. There are mounds everywhere, so it's not even flat. 
The Banshee's howling has also become much louder.
"Kihhihhihhihhi!"
"Khrrhr, hyaaah!"
Of course, the biggest change is something else.
Starting at this point, higher-level monsters…
That is, level 8 monsters, start to appear.
"...Bjorn, they won't really attack first, will they?"
Einar has been grinding his teeth since before. Maybe he's scared of the Banshee sound?
Barbarians clench their jaws when they're scared, they say...
I don't know.
Maybe it's because I've never been that scared?
"Kwooow!"
As we continue to move, a strange roar echoes from the darkness.  
Damn, hearing that in person is truly terrifying.
"Einar, prepare for battle."
"But, aren't we not killing Banshees?"
Does this guy even have ears?
"It's not a Banshee."
Deathspind. 
Of the many level 8 monsters that contribute to the difficulty of the game, this is undoubtedly the one that gets the "biggest asshole" rating.
***
Wooong! Wooong! Wooong! Wooong!
The heavy footsteps I sensed from afar grow louder and louder until the monster reveals itself in front of us.
"...We're going to fight that thing?"
Einar asks me, then murmurs before I can answer.
"This is going to be fun."
I can't figure this guy out.  One moment he's scared of dying, and the next he's laughing at this thing? 
And scared of Banshees?
Wooong!
As if the light bothers him, Deathspind stops in his tracks at the edge of the light.
"Don't be nervous."
"Don't worry, I'm not nervous."
Why are you answering? It was meant for me.
Damn, I made a plan while I was coming, but seeing this thing in person, my knees are shaking. 
Deathspind is a humanoid undead monster.
Or maybe it's more of a chimera?
It stands over three meters tall, and its arms have a sword and shield attached.  
Not held, but literally attached.
One arm, long and curved, is sharpened like a crescent moon. The other arm, which extends out from the elbow, is spread wide and shaped like a shield.
Its name: Protein Blade & Shield.
"Kwooow!"
Damn, stop screaming like that. It's terrifying.
I'm trying to reduce the fear, but it's not easy.
"If you just calmly follow the plan, you can win."
"Of course, I trust you."
I appreciate that, but it was something I said to myself again.
...Stay calm.
This is our first try, but as long as we don't loosen the reins of tension, nothing dangerous will happen. 
If the situation worsens, run like hell.
"As I said, just target its head. Nothing else matters. Got it?"
"Got it!"
No, that wasn't a signal to rush in right now.
"Behel—laaaaa!"
Einar charges forward with his broadsword in both hands.
It's too late to stop him.
The roar draws the monster's attention.  It was just lurking at the edge of the light, but now it charges forward with sword and shield.
"Kwooow!"
Kwaang!
Einar's broadsword meets Deathspind's Protein Blade with a deafening roar.
"Bjorn, be careful! This thing is powerful."
Don't you usually know that when you see it?
"Behel—laaaaa!"
I also roar loudly and charge forward.  I create a wall with my shield, and then strike the side of the monster as it tries to attack the recoiling Einar. 
But is this the weight of its physique?
It feels like I've slammed into a rock.
Tsszt.
As the monster pushes back, I'm pushed backward with the shield still in my hand.
There's no reason to hold on, but I'm embarrassed.
So I stand on the balls of my feet. 
Then, I throw my entire weight forward, letting out a scream, not a roar.
"Aaaah!"
Damn! My muscles feel like they're tearing.
But I feel an indescribable joy.
It feels like I'm going to die, but... I've held on.
And Einar wasn't naive enough to just ignore that opening.
Hooong!
A heavy sound of cutting air as his broadsword swings down, striking Deathspind's temple. 
Not a slash, but literally a hit.
Clack!
That massive blade struck, but only about a centimeter of it went in. 
The dull thud must have been from the skull. 
Well, even in the game, Deathspind's defense was infamous. 
But for many beginners, it wasn't the defense that made them quit the game, but the regeneration.
"Kwooow!"
"Fall back!"
We create distance, dodging the enraged Deathspind.
Crimson blood oozes out of the spot where the broadsword was pulled out, but the bleeding stops in less than three seconds.
The monster's passive skill, 'Body Preservation'.
"Einar! Create an opening. I'm going to attack this time."
Just as I'm giving the order and about to charge in again.
Drrrd!
Suddenly, the ground starts to shake. 
I've never seen this effect before, but I know exactly what it is as soon as I see it.
Deathspind's active skill. 
'Summon the Dead'.
"Get back, ghouls are coming!"
When the tremors stop, ghouls burrow up from beneath the ground.
The exact number is ten.
"Take care of these guys first!"
"Got it!"
While Einar swings his broadsword at the ghouls.
"Kwooow!"
I keep my eyes on Deathspind, doing a tight mark.
However, the ghouls keep drawing my aggro, and their claws tear my skin, turning it into a bunch of rags in an instant. 
Of course, it's not a big deal.
I have regeneration, too.
Just not as good as yours.
"Bjorn! I'll take this one now!"
After holding on for two minutes, the ghouls are taken care of.
I can't help but laugh.
Just taking hits until Deathspind's summon pattern is over. 
'I never did this in the game, either.'
As Einar takes over the one-on-one mark, I pull out my mace and move behind the monster.
Then, I slam it into the back of its head.
Bang!
Good feel, good sound.
Even in the real world, the blood pours out of the back of its head, which is covered in hair.
But I keep swinging my mace.
Bang! Bang! Bang!
Each hit carries the power that would have turned a goblin into light upon impact.
But why the hell isn't it dying?
Clack!
When I experienced it firsthand, the skull's strength was beyond imagination. Even as I'm hitting it, the flesh is healing.
...What should I do?
My attack power is lacking.
I should have bought the weapon the weapon dealer recommended back then.
Should I just give up on catching this one and hunt for a level 9 monster?
Clack! Clack! Clack!
As I ponder, I keep swinging my mace, but it's not enough to crush its brain.
Hooong!
Eventually, I have no choice but to fall back, dodging the Protein Blade as it swings down.
Then, just then.
"Kwoot!"
Deathspind suddenly loses its balance and tilts its head.
I see Einar has taken advantage of an opening and grabbed one of the monster's legs, lifting it up.
It's a technique I often see in the UFC.
Could this be...
'A single-leg takedown?'
"Behel—laaaaa!"
His muscles are pumping, and veins are bulging out as if they're going to burst. This side looks even more monstrous than the other...
But the intention is clear, and the possibility is there. 
So I join in immediately.
Bang!
I slam the ankle that's touching the ground with my mace with all my might, and the massive body loses its balance and hovers for a moment.
Then...
Wooong!
It finally crashes to the ground.
In professional terms, it's a takedown.
This is the first time I've seen a battle like this against a monster categorized as medium to large.
...Nothing's impossible for a barbarian.
"Kwooow!"
Deathspind struggles like a flipped-over bug.
We immediately rush to attack, but we both flinch simultaneously.
"Kwooow!"
You're not telling me you can't get up on your own?
"Bjorn!"
"Oou!"
We can understand each other's thoughts just by looking at each other.
Einar and I rush towards the fallen monster and wildly swing our weapons at it.
We take turns hitting it, like pounding rice cakes on a mortar.
Thwack! Thwack! Thwack! Thwack! Thwack!
Come to think of it, I did exactly this with rice cakes at a folk village I visited when I was in elementary school.
"This is fun!"
Maybe it's because I remember the classmate who was in my group at the time, crying and asking to switch? 
Seeing Einar's happy face makes the hurt in my heart disappear.
It feels like my soul is being purified.
*You killed Deathspind. EXP +2.*
As we watch Deathspind turn into light and disappear, we smile brightly.  
We didn't have the wizard's powerful magic, the priest's divine power, or the elf's spirit magic...
"Bjorn! Look at this! The magic stone is huge!"
We succeeded in hunting a level 8 monster.
