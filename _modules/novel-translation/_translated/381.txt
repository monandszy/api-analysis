## Atlante (4)
The subterranean island of Atlante. It was, in fact, the most challenging part of cultivating a shield barbarian. It wasn't for nothing that it was called the second core essence.
Normally, when reaching this point, one's setup would consist only of low-grade essences, below level 4. It would be impossible to first obtain the combination of Stormgush's [Origin], Byron's [Transcendence], and the gacha essence's [Risk-Taking] before arriving here.  
Therefore, a solo attempt at this point was impossible, and one would need to secure suitable companions, make thorough preparations, and then enter. Only after consuming the essence found here would one's combat power dramatically increase, finally allowing for the commencement of level 3 essence looting. 
"Well, looks like things got reversed."
Thinking back, it all seemed to have begun with the ogre's essence. I had been fortunate enough to acquire a high-grade essence early on, and from there, my growth accelerated like a snowball rolling downhill. 
Just like this:
"You have defeated the Mermal Priest. EXP +6."
"You have defeated the Ravitor. EXP +5."
"You have defeated the Undersea Guardian. EXP +4."
"You have defeated the Nagakulos…"
"…"
I was simply charging forward, drawing aggro from the monsters, yet my experience points were steadily climbing. It almost felt like a speedrun at this point. 
Of course, I had to take breaks in between. No matter how strong I was, my MP wasn't unlimited. Especially here, where I had the "Hyperventilation" status effect, which doubled my resource consumption.
"Sir!"
My companions caught up, having gathered the gemstones as they followed. 
"An essence dropped back there. What are you going to do with it?"
Huh? Essence? 
I was so busy getting beaten up and running forward that I didn't even notice. 
After a moment of contemplation, I answered:
"Just leave it be." 
It would have been a valuable find, considering it was dropped by a level 4 monster, the Mermal Priest. But I had personally confirmed that it doesn't drop essences. 
There was no reason to waste one of my two vials on an unidentified essence. It would be a slight gain if it turned out to be a level 5, but a significant loss if it was level 6. 
"Amelia, how far have we come?"
"We're over halfway."
"We've been moving in a straight line ever since entering this place. Is there a reason?"
"We can capture the monsters on the periphery later."
As Amelia and I were talking, Erwen chimed in.
"Oh, is it because of the rivals you mentioned earlier?"
Honestly, it was a bit ambiguous.
My nature is to tackle the most important things first, according to their priority. But, I couldn't deny that it wasn't entirely unrelated to those rivals.
"Yes, just in case."
Atlante isn't like a rift. Once the portal opens, it remains active until the labyrinth closes, and explorers can freely travel between this place and the outside world.
"What if we encounter them?"
"I don't know."
I gave a perfunctory response before continuing.
"If they attack, we fight. Otherwise, we'll just pass by."
"I see…"
Amelia nodded with a dubious expression, seemingly unconvinced by my answer.
I considered letting it slide but couldn't resist asking.
"It seems like you have something you want to say."
"I was just thinking… which side you would welcome."
"Welcome?"
"Exactly what I said."
"…"
Seeing my gaze demanding further explanation, Amelia hesitantly asked.
"Amelia, are you secretly hoping they will attack first?"
The moment I heard those words, I felt a surge of emotions, and countless reasons to defend myself flooded my mind. 
But I suppressed them and asked again.
"Why do you suddenly think that?"
"It's not sudden. It's just that I've been thinking this way ever since observing you."
Amelia shrugged, glancing at the navigator and the mage.
I followed her gaze, and those two, fearing that they might be caught in the crossfire, hurriedly averted their eyes and pretended not to have heard anything.
I was a little confused.
"Amelia, of all people, I wouldn't have expected you to say something like that. Are you saying I should have let those guys who attacked me live?"
My voice became sharp, unintentionally.
Amelia flinched and shook her head.
"That's not what I meant. It's just…"
"Just?"
"No, forget it. I just said something stupid."
Amelia mumbled, retreating backward. I didn't press further. 
Of course, I was still curious. 
What were the words that remained unspoken behind that trailing off statement? I wouldn't know, as I didn't ask.
But for some reason…
"Have you ever considered, brother? You kill anyone who gets in your way. You kill anyone you suspect. And whenever you meet someone new, you're immediately worried they might hurt you.  Human lives… they just feel like game characters to you. You're totally insane, you know?"
A past conversation with Baekho flashed through my mind. 
It had resonated with me back then, but now, thinking back, it felt different. 
Especially the part about human lives being like game characters.
"KWAK!"
One swing of a hammer, and a person dies. 
Of course, the targets are always those I classify as deserving death according to my standards. 
But…
"Pl, please! I beg you! Spare me!"
That man, the first one whose blood stained my hands.
It wasn't like this during Hans A. 
Back then, I felt a psychological resistance and had to constantly convince myself that it was necessary. I had to keep swinging my weapon. 
It was similar for a while after that as well.
The hesitation in my hand disappeared, but a sense of unease lingered for a long time. This continued even after I returned to the city.
The gazes and expressions they wore in those moments kept coming back, so I intentionally emptied my mind, refreshing myself with cold water.
Yes, that was me back then. But what about now?
"That captain… what did his face look like?"
Now I can't even remember the faces of the people I killed recently. 
The only things that remain vivid are the equipment they wore, the expensive valuables, and the intense stimulation I felt when I got my hands on them.
Is this what you call getting used to it? Or should I say, is this what gradually transformed me into who I am today?
"Sir, what are you thinking about…?"
"Nothing important. We'll take a break for 30 minutes and move again, so you can rest too."
I laid down without hesitation on the damp floor and looked up. 
The darkness of the labyrinth stretching endlessly from the edge of the light that surrounds us. 
It's strange. 
The 7th, 8th, 9th, and 10th floors. 
Only four more levels remain. Once we pass through those, we can go through the Door to the Abyss and return to the modern world. 
Yet…
Despite climbing so much higher than when I was struggling on the 1st and 2nd floors, the destination seemed further away.
***
After resting for about 30 minutes and replenishing my MP, I continued my exploration of the subterranean island, going through the same process as before.
In other words, I went ahead, cleared everything, and my companions followed behind, gathering the gemstones.
"If we capture all the external monsters too, the gem income will be significant."
Even thinking that, I found myself laughing.
It's not like the income, no matter how high it is, could compare to the battle I recently had.
Despite some damage, I had three ships and over 10 sets of high-grade equipment. It's a level of exploration income that can't be achieved by just killing monsters.
"Strong Luck."
"150% of the damage received is reflected back to the enemy."
A critical hit popped up, and the last monster that stubbornly followed me disappeared in a flash of light. 
And…
"We're already at the boss room."
I had unknowingly reached the heart of Atlante.
A vast open space with giant pillars the size of several-story buildings arranged in a circle. In the center of those pillars lay a massive egg. It was much larger, several times bigger, than even me in my [Gigantification] form.
"It looks just like the egg in the game."
I chuckled to myself, just then…
"The character has witnessed a part of the myth."
My heart thumped heavily, and a sense of fulfillment filled me. 
"Achievement unlocked."
Condition: Mythical Discovery (1/5)
Reward: Permanent increase in soul power by +10.
What? Did my MP just go up? If this is true, it means the 'achievement' system is properly activated… 
"So, did I unlock a lot of mental achievements so far?"
I wasn't sure because the mental stats didn't show a clear change. But, I think I'll have to start hunting for achievements from now on. 
There are some really useful achievements from the 7th floor onwards.
"Wait, maybe I should have brought the others too?"
I had that thought suddenly, but decided to check it out next time. 
The probability of an essence dropping on the first try is low anyway. It wouldn't be too late to do it next time.
And besides, I don't even know if achievements apply to natives. 
WHOOSH—
As I entered the space between the pillars, a massive whirlpool formed, blocking the path behind me.
It's a useless effect, in my opinion. I can't even take a step back because of the "Challenger" status effect.
THUD.
As I walked towards the egg in the center, the whirlpool outside, as if the sea itself was enraged, vibrated even more violently.
And…
WOOM! WOOM! WOOM!
A heavy roar resonated, shaking the ground at regular intervals.
That heavy roar was getting closer…
WOOM!
The moment the ground stopped shaking, I looked up.
Two piercing blue eyes were looking down at me from the deep darkness.
The level 3 monster, Deep Sea Giant.
Except for Atlante, it's a monster you'd only encounter on the 9th floor. Of course, by then, they would be swarming in hordes like mobs, and their weaknesses wouldn't be as exposed as they are now. Hunting them would be several times harder.
"Serkima Deo Merder."
Like in the game, the giant roared at me, spewing incomprehensible words. I couldn't tell from the text alone, but its voice was full of disdain. 
Therefore…
"BEHEL—RAAAAAAAA!!!"
After activating [Gigantification], I finally roared the name of my ancestral god.
There's nobody here but me, anyway. 
THUD. 
Oh, of course, the place I charged toward while yelling a war cry was the spot where the central egg was. 
This is how you defeat this guy.
THUMP!
The egg pulsed, as if alive. Or should I call it a heart that looks like an egg?
KWAANG-!
I swung the Devil Crusher with all my might, striking the heart, and at the same time, the giant roared, bringing its palm down, which I dodged by quickly retreating.
You can reflect damage with [Risk-Taking] only for skills that consume resources.  
There's no reason to take a non-reflective physical attack.
"The Deep Sea Giant has used [Blade Torrent]."
As soon as its physical attack missed, the giant launched a skill. It flew toward me in a straight line, leaving a sharp trajectory like a bullet fired from underwater. 
Hundreds of streams of water.
I should just take this…
"Strong Luck."
"150% of the damage received is reflected back to the enemy."
What? It's a critical hit from the start?
"GRA-CHAAAAT-!"
I braced myself to take the hit, protecting only the vital points, and a roar filled with the fury of a skeleton echoed from behind.
And…
WHOOSH—
A much thicker stream of water than the one aimed at me soared towards the sea giant.
"GRA-AAA-AAAA-!"
It seemed like the giant took significant damage. It swayed unsteadily, unable to stand properly despite its massive size.
It brought its fist down again.  Normally, the standard is to dodge. But…
KWAANG-!
Should I go there and capture the level 3 essences afterwards?
"It's bearable if it's just this much."
I wouldn't be crushed by holding the shield.  The damage transferred to my bones is instantly recovered thanks to [Origin].
"The Deep Sea Giant has used [Life Source]."
The giant used its life force stored in its heart to heal its main body. 
It was one of its main attacks. 
Deep Sea Giants you encounter on the 9th floor don't have their hearts exposed like this.
Based on this, the giant boasts immense regenerative power, demonstrating the formidable strength of a level 3 monster. 
Well, it doesn't mean much here.
It's not for nothing that I always choose this monster as my first level 3 essence.
THUMP.
Its size had shrunk, beating a little weaker than before.
KWAANG-! KWAANG-! KWAANG-!
I didn't have to dodge any more physical attacks, so I stuck to its heart and swung the hammer repeatedly.  The giant retaliated, using various skills to stop me, which were reflected back, inflicting damage on its main body.
And…
"The Deep Sea Giant has used [Life Source]."
The vicious cycle continues.  The heart transfers life force towards the main body, and the amount of life force transferred weakens its heart's defense.  
How many times did this happen?
THUMP.
The heart was several times smaller than when I first saw it.  
KWAANG-! KWAANG-! KWAANG-!
I swung the hammer down towards its heart, which was smaller than before.
And then.
KWAK-!
I received good news and bad news at the same time.
"You have defeated the Deep Sea Giant. EXP +7."
The first good news is that I had completed hunting a level 3 monster easier than ever.  
And the second…
WHOOSH—
The essence appeared, on the first try.
But this is where the bad news begins.
"Damn it."
The essence appeared, but unfortunately, it wasn't the color I wanted.
Well, what matters in the current situation?
I looked beyond the whirlpool, which had disappeared without a trace, right after defeating the Deep Sea Giant.
"…"
His attire was hard to believe as attire for a labyrinth.  
He wore plain clothes, with elegant white skin and a lean physique.  
And his platinum blonde hair was neatly styled in a pompadour. 
"Hey, what's up? Did you really capture it alone?"
An unexpected encounter awaited me.
