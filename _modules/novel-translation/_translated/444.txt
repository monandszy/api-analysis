## The Party (1)
The banquet held within the Palace of Glory unfolded in a remarkably subdued atmosphere. It was hardly surprising, considering every attendee was the head of a noble house. There was a need for heightened decorum, especially amongst such a distinguished gathering of individuals, most of whom were advanced in years.
'Perhaps the majority are in their fifties…' I mused, a chuckle escaping my lips.  I, the supposed centerpiece of this grand gathering, was reduced to sulking in solitude.
Gnawing on a piece of meat with a touch of annoyance, I couldn't help but feel a sense of déjà vu, a creeping feeling akin to PTSD from my days of frequent school transfers.  I was acutely aware that I was now a lone wolf amidst a new pack, entirely stripped bare.
"…"
It felt like I'd been relegated to the status of a zoo animal. 
'Count Ferdehilt, Baron Serpía, Viscount Mülbark...  And look, there's Baron Martoan…'
Among those who briefly glanced in my direction, I recognized a few familiar faces.  Yet, none approached, not a single one.  A stark contrast to other gatherings where they'd eagerly initiated introductions.  Count Ferdehilt, for instance, had even gone so far as to suggest a marriage alliance between his daughter and myself.
'Well, I suppose I can't fault their perspective…'
This was a kingdom ruled by beasts, albeit beasts guided by reason rather than instinct. 
Gnawing on the meat, I feigned ignorance, though I was fully aware of the situation's delicate balance. This was a subtle form of taming, a silent message that despite becoming one of the kingdom's noble houses, I was not to believe I held equal footing with those who'd built their lineage over millennia.
However, the solution was simple.  As the Duke I'd met earlier had advised, I could simply approach them first.  They'd respond with gracious smiles, but their demeanor would betray their true intentions.  They'd treat me like a subordinate.
'Oh, the tiresome lives they lead.'
The choice of who I approached first held significant weight.  If I went to the Duke, the nobles under the authority of the Marquess - his rival - would treat me as an invisible barbarian.  My every action and word would carry political implications within this intricate web of power.
Despite the complexities of the situation, I remained focused on my meal.  My reasons were threefold.  First, I was genuinely hungry. Second, the meat was truly delicious.  And lastly, 
'Here she comes.'
From the very beginning, I had no intention of becoming part of the mainstream.
"It's futile, no matter how long you wait," I said, a subtle smile playing on my lips as I observed the approaching figure.
"No one will come, after all."
Her hair was as white as snow, mirroring her eyes and skin.  She wore an attire that evoked images of a traditional Hanbok, a riot of colors amidst a backdrop of pure white.  And, of course, those rabbit ears perched atop her head.
"Greetings, Baron Jandel. Is the food to your liking?"
"So-so. Fancy sharing a piece?"
As I offered her some of the freshly grilled meat, she stared blankly for a moment, then regained her composure, a smile gracing her lips.
"No, thank you. I'm not very hungry."
Oh, how picky.
Even amongst fellow異種族. 
With a decisive flick of my wrist, I placed the remaining meat back on the plate, ending my meal.  This was enough.  It was time for conversation.  I wiped my hands, a thoughtful expression crossing my face.
'If she offered a handshake... would I accept?'
While the question lingered in my mind, I had no intention of actually attempting it.  Even a barbarian possesses a modicum of decorum, especially if it serves his best interest.
"Anyway, nice to meet you. I'm Baron Jandel."
My introduction was met with a pleasant smile and a reply.
"Baron Ririviá," she said. 
This information was already known to me.  After all, the noble house of the White Rabbit族 was unique.
'She's forty-three, with three children.'
"May I join you for a moment?"
"Of course. I was getting quite bored."
With permission granted, Baron Ririviá - or the Rabbit Baron, as I liked to call her - settled into the seat across from me.  For the first time since the banquet began, the eight-seater table was no longer vacant.  
There was no applause, however, to celebrate this monumental occasion.  Only pointed mockery.
"Tsk, so this is how it ends."
"Let them be. The commoners have chosen to remain amongst themselves."
Their words were loud enough for my barbarian ears to hear, undoubtedly audible to the rabbit woman as well.  Yet, she remained unfazed, simply smiling and speaking to me in a composed tone.
"My ancestor, the first head of our house, was a hero, much like yourself, Baron Jandel.  He achieved the feat of stopping the Duke of Discord during the Iron Wall Crisis. Have you heard of him?"
"No, sorry, but I'm hearing about him for the first time today."
"Oh, my apologies.  That's understandable.  It's a tale only those who've studied history know well. It's an ancient story now..."
Her voice was laced with a melancholic undercurrent as she continued.
"Two thousand years."
"…"
"Two thousand years have passed since our family crest was inscribed in the Pact of the Covenant. A truly long time, long enough for the era of the immortal king to end and a new dawn to arrive."
I sensed where she was going.
"That's why you, Baron Jandel, need to acclimate quickly.  Their perception won't change, no matter how much time passes."
"Oh, is that so?  Strange.  To me, you all look pretty much the same."
Especially in their eloquence.
"…"
"You're just as interesting as they say," she said, a playful tone lacing her voice.
Interesting?  The real fun hadn't even started yet.
"Anyway, you're not here just to offer advice, am I right?"
"You're perceptive, Baron.  You are right."
"Then speak."
My direct question caught her off guard for a moment.  Perhaps it was the subtle way I'd earlier dismissed their differences.  While she had ears, she was still a noblewoman representing her house.  A woman who viewed breaking convention as vulgar.
"…"
"I won't say we're here to help.  We do not wish for your house to be subservient to another power."
"Because your house is the first of its kind in the history of Raphdonia, a noble house of異種族 descent, born after six hundred years?"
Her eyes widened at my question.  But after a deep breath, she shifted her tone, meeting my gaze head-on.
"…"
"More importantly, you're a barbarian.  The first one in Raphdonia's history."
Her statement revealed that perhaps she viewed me as nothing more than a barbarian, even more so than those human nobles.
"Just like our house, Baron Ririviá, receives the full support of the獸人족, your house can bring the barbarians into the political sphere."
"Is that all?"
"Even without this situation, it would be the same.  We're all precious individuals."
"Hmm, I see..."
"Thirty-one houses stand united, including ours.  We're a minority in the political landscape, but at least we have a voice."
As she continued her explanation, I remained indifferent, my chin resting on my hand.  The Rabbit Baron sensed my disinterest and took the initiative.
"I won't ask you to join us for a greater purpose."
Yes, the anxious party should make the first move.
"If you join our cause, you'll receive immense support as you establish your foundation."
"Tell me more."
"For instance, you'll need land, a mansion, and a plethora of personnel to maintain your house.  Years that would normally span decades can be cut down to a mere few years with our backing."
Noble society.
It truly begins with a bang.
Even with just this, the compensation for choosing 'Nobility' at the Ceremony would be more than recouped.
"Of course, this isn't all.  We're starting from a position of survival."
She spoke directly.
"If you stand with us, Baron Jandel, our enemies become yours."
"…"
"And yours become ours."
This was the reason I hadn't approached any other nobles.  Since each one was valuable, we truly valued each and every one.
"Well, what do you say?"
She waited for my response, and I nodded.
"Certainly... not bad."
"That means—"
"But it's not enough."
"…"
Don't let the expression fool you.
We could definitely get more; settling for this would be a waste.
The Rabbit Baron's eyes hardened at my response.  But she quickly regained her composure, politely asking.
"From my personal interaction, Baron Jandel, I see you as a shrewd individual. Is there anything you desire? Please, be frank with me."
This, too, spoke volumes.  She, and by extension, the異種族 noble alliance 'Melbes', truly desired my involvement.  I yearned for their partnership as much as they yearned for mine.  
'But they don't know that.'
If I'm going to sell, I'll get the highest price.  That's the spirit of a K-Barbarian. 
"I'm going to continue entering the Labyrinth.  I'd like your support with that."
"…"
"Could you provide some examples?"
"I'd like you to sponsor the clan I'll create.  Superior essences, rare numbered items, things like that."
"…"
"It wouldn't be easy. We wouldn't see any benefit from that."
"Why wouldn't there be?  Don't you know?  This country starts and ends with the Labyrinth."
"If you mean influence within the Labyrinth, we already have other alternatives."
Tsk, of course things wouldn't be easy.  It's time to play the barbarian card again.
"No, why not?!"
"…"
"You're going to buy me land and build me a mansion.  This is cheaper than that!"
"Baron Jandel, maybe your voice could be a little—"
"Give me a reason!!"
The moment I rose, every noble in the room turned their attention towards us.  
Did she feel overwhelmed by their gaze?
"Support for your house and this are different.  Establishing your house will help you later in politics, this won't."
The Rabbit Baron gave her reason in a rapid-fire delivery.  But did she feel something was missing after she spoke?
"But you never know… If Baron Jandel becomes an invaluable asset to our cause, we'll be willing to give anything without hesitation."
"What?! You're saying I'm not a valuable asset right now?!"
"No, that's not what I meant—!"
"Ha ha!  I was just kidding, Baron Ririviá."
"…"
"Huh?"
With a laugh, I returned to my seat, leaving her speechless.
'You can't even joke around.'
"To put it simply, you need to prove your worth. You need to show us you're more than just the 'First Barbarian Baron' with a title."
"Yes… ah, yes.  Of course..."
"Then there's no problem.  It's a breeze for me."
"…"
I'd answered confidently, and she was clearly flustered.  Then, I heard murmurs from the other nobles.
"They argued so much, and now they're chuckling?"
"Those hybrids... they're truly beastly."
"What did Baron Ririviá say to appease that barbarian?"
"Hmm, you never know.  I heard he has a taste for獸人족."
"Huh?  You mean...?"
"Ahem, it's not entirely out of the question, is it?"
Their whispers were vulgar enough for my barbarian ears to hear, and certainly for this rabbit woman.  Her face flushed crimson with shame, a reaction that surprised me.  I had heard countless insults, but never anything so blatant.
"…"
"Baron Jandel."
She was still worried that I might cause another scene.
"Just ignore them.  You'll hear plenty of this if you're going to get involved in politics."
"Why?"
"…"
"Because there's no other way."
Her answer was honest, a reflection of a weaker being's frustration.  But her face, paired with her words, made her look like an herbivore.
I let out a soft chuckle, a playful smirk playing on my lips.
"You said you were used to it, but you still get angry, don't you?"
"How could I not? I just have to endure it, hoping for the day I won't have to feel this humiliation."
Just enduring it?  If hoping was enough, there'd be no misery in this world.  So, 
"How much is that worth?"
"…"
"If I can't make your dream a reality, but at least I can make sure those who gossip behind your back disappear."
"What do you mean?"
Thankfully, she hadn't quite caught on.  She answered my question readily.
"Well, ideally, I'd pay a fortune for that."
A vague and subjective response.  But it was enough.
"Alright, then the deal is done."
"…"
"I actually analyzed your house.  The reason you've been beaten up for so long is because you've always been beaten up."
"What, what do you mea—"
What do you mean, you ask?  What you need is a frontliner, that's what you mean. 
With a flick of my wrist, I rose from my seat, silencing any potential counter-arguments.  And then, 
"BEHELL—RAAAAAAAA!!!"
I roared my war cry,  drawing their attention.  With purposeful strides, I approached them.
"Hey, Baron Jandel!"
I ignored the Rabbit Baron's panicked call, continuing my walk.  It took a mere few seconds to reach my destination.  In front of the noble who'd been whispering about my preference for獸人족.
"…"
"What's the matter?  Why are you being so loud?"
He seemed oblivious, his eyes narrowed in defiance.  A sure sign of a coward lacking awareness.
"Baron Cypriot."
We hadn't formally introduced ourselves, but there was no problem with calling him by name.  After deciding to play the noble route, I'd memorized all the crests of the noble houses.
'A Baron with no strong backing.  Perfect for an example.'
I addressed him directly.
"You insulted me."
"Insulted? Are you serious? Because of what I said earlier?  Ha!  You're not even worth insulting.  And if you were, what are you going to do about it?"
He was trying to act nonchalant.  But his words were long and flustered, a telltale sign of panic.
"If you can't control your emotions, then write your opinion and submit it to the Committee.  Oh, I doubt you can write, but you can try!"
He finished speaking, and his friends beside him began to chuckle.  
He's not even a proper gangster. 
Who's truly the lowlife here?
"Now, if you have nothing else to say, then excuse me—"
He's out of words, you say?  Why would he be?
I cut him off mid-sentence.
"I challenge you to a duel."
A duel.  The sole method of resolving conflict in Raphdonia, dating back to the ancient noble society.  Of course, the number of titled nobles who'd personally engaged in duels was less than ten throughout history.
And thus, 
"Scared?  If you're afraid, a proxy duel is fine too.  Oh, but I'll be the one fighting."
"Are you serious?"
"Why? Do you wish it wasn't?"
"…"
He remained silent, his mind predictable.  He'd be offended and frightened by this unprecedented situation.  He'd be thinking, 'I just acted like I always did, there were others around, why do I have to go through this?'
But, 
'It's time he knew.'
A barbarian noble has just been born, hasn't he?  It's time to rekindle the tension in the lax aristocratic society.
Yes, that's why... 
With a measured step, I approached him, looking down upon him.
"Knight, explorer, mage, it doesn't matter."
While proxy duels are generally restricted to those within the house, 
"It doesn't have to be someone from your house."
"…"
"Bring anyone you want."
"…"
"The strongest person you can call."
He didn't answer.
"Why so hesitant?"
I, on the other hand, am ready.  I'm confident that I can kill whoever you bring, right here.
