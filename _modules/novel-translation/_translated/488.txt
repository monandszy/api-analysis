## The Pilgrim (6)
Among the various detection abilities with their own unique characteristics, there are naturally those with a precognitive concept.
A prime example is [The Needle of Regret].
A Tier 1 Essence skill that can be looted from Floor 9 onwards.
Its effect is simple.
In the game, upon acquiring this skill, when an ally died, a message would appear: "The memory of regret reverses time."  This allowed the player to start again at a critical juncture.
Hmm, calling it precognitive might be a bit of a stretch, though.
Anyway, this skill, with its overpowered ability, had an equally distinct drawback.
The requirement of being in a 'bonded' state with the ally for it to activate.
The cooldown time, which was several months based on the city's timeline.
And despite that, only three uses were allowed.
It also wouldn't activate if the user died.
Therefore...
'This skill isn't it.'
Right now, we're not in a bonded state, and judging from our conversation, it seems they've already used it at least twice, so the possibility of this being the skill is non-existent.
'The most plausible one is... that one, I suppose.'
I quickly narrowed down the most likely candidate.
[Prophet of Misfortune]
A Tier 6 passive skill with a high acquisition difficulty.
Having it equipped would trigger it randomly, providing the player with future information through system logs in the form of advice.
Like this:
"An ominous vision graces the Prophet's eye."
"In the near future, Bjorn Jandel will meet his end at the blade of the Dreadpier, the centurion who follows him. Do not be reassured by his absence. He will never abandon you."
This is why I classified it as an information detection skill and, indeed, I used it frequently in the middle stages for such purposes.
Knowing whether or not a trap was present, the type of monster and its characteristics beforehand was a huge help in unexplored areas.
But…
'The actual feeling will be different.'
Once the skill activates, I'll truly see a 'vision'.
And I'll experience firsthand what was just a few lines of information in the game.
"Huff… Huff…."
"...Ainar, did you perhaps see me die?"
"..."
Again, there was no answer.
But the slight flinching of her body, the response to my question, gave me the answer.
'So that's why she's pushing herself this hard….'
I quickly clamped my mouth shut.
She wouldn't listen to any explanation, no matter how convincing.
That was all I could do right now.
"Left."
Guiding her towards the right path.
And...
Clack.
Gritting my teeth.
"Behel—raaaahhh!!!"
Helplessly, I was carried on Ainar's back, who was pushing through soldiers with her bare hands.
Pwoo—!
An arrow pierced my leg.
"Die!"
Watching my flesh being ripped apart by a sharp spear point.
That was all I could do.
"Got him! Now! Hurry…!"
"Aaarghh!!"
“…What kind of strength—!”
Ainar finally stopped her reckless charge after enduring a painful run for a long time.
It wasn't because we'd reached our destination.
We still had a way to go before the cave entrance, but it was too much.
To keep going while protecting me.
Thud.
Her speed slowed with the piling wounds, and as the gap between her and the chasing soldiers narrowed, Ainar finally halted her reckless rush.
And...
"Don't... worry."
With those words, she swung her weapon against the soldiers who were flooding in like a tide.
I watched her retreating figure, seated by the wall, just staring blankly.
One, two, three, four, five, six...
When she struck down the seventh soldier, an axe was embedded in Ainar's forearm.
Thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, seventeen…
When she killed the eighteenth soldier, a spear pierced her clavicle.
Forty-three, forty-four, forty-five…
The forty-sixth soldier sent an arrow flying, penetrating her left eye.
Seventy-one, seventy-two, seventy-three.
With every passing moment, the number of corpses piled up.
One hundred.
A brief silence fell.
Soldiers were hesitant to close the distance, seeing her stand unharmed, despite being riddled with arrows and bleeding from multiple wounds.
"..."
"..."
Of course, it lasted for a very short time.
"She's exhausted! Don't back down!"
Soldiers, stepping over the piled corpses, swung their weapons once more.
One hundred and thirty.
Ainar apologized to me.
"Sorry…."
"..."
"I'm... out of... strength."
Ainar collapsed, wrapping her body around mine.
Pwoo, pwoo, pwoo—!
Sounds that shouldn't have come from my ally's body echoed in my ears.
Beeeeeep—!
It felt like I was having a nightmare.
My head was numb, and I felt dizzy, like I was going to throw up.
Pwoo, pwoo, pwoo—!
Beeeeeep—!
Countless sounds rang in my ears.
And how many times did that eternal moment repeat before the body that had forced me to watch everything helplessly—
Wiggle.
Started to move.
***
"Character's Life force has reached 30%."
"Status ailment [Paralysis] is lifted."
***
I stretched out my arm and grabbed whatever weapon was within reach.
Then, pushing Ainar's body away, I stood up.
Hoooong—!
I swung my weapon widely.
The soldiers were startled and stepped back, creating a small opening. I quickly picked up Ainar and started running.
Just like Ainar had carried me before.
"Aaarghh!!!"
I ran through the passage, filled with soldiers.
"B, block him!"
Weapons swung to stop me.
With each step, minor injuries piled up on my body.
However, I didn’t block or evade them.
As long as those weapons weren't aimed at Ainar, I, the brute tank, charged forward, absorbing them with my body.
How much time passed?
"Character's Life force is below 15%."
My body, barely restored, was once again tattered, but I managed to break through the siege.
"Huff... Huff...."
A small amount of free time was granted.
While running, I checked Ainar’s condition.
"Ainar! Are you alright? Snap out of it! Don’t sleep! Wake up—."
At that moment, a faint voice reached my ear.
“…B, Bjorn."
“!”
…Right, she was alive.
"Th, thank goodness.  Hi, are you alright?  Just hold on a little longer!  Ten minutes!  No, eight minutes will do!"
Then we can escape this cave.
Of course, I didn't know if that was the clear condition, but considering the ridiculous escape difficulty, there was a high chance we'd have access to some means of recovery in the next chapter.
"So…!"
Just trust me a little longer.
Just as I was about to continue, Ainar spoke.
"…L, leave... me."
What is she trying to say?
Maybe I heard wrong because her voice was muffled and weak.
But...
"L, leave… me…."
…I heard correctly.
I was angry, but I couldn’t bring myself to say anything cruel to the injured.
So, I decided to ignore it.
“You've lost too much blood, you must be delirious."
"..."
"Just stay still. That’s all you can do now."
I don't know if she decided to follow me or if she just didn't have the strength anymore.
But Ainar didn't speak anymore.
'…She's not dead, right?'
I forced down my anxiety with dry saliva.
And ran forward, my heart pounding.
As the entrance drew near, I could smell the scent of the bushes, and the light seeping in gradually illuminated the surroundings.
The blinding entrance came into view in the distance.
"Ainar! Ainar! Snap out of it. We're almost out!"
"..."
"Answer me!"
"…Ca, careful."
What is she saying?
Anyway, she's alive, so that's all that matters.
So, let’s get out—.
"..."
Arriving at the cave entrance, I stopped in my tracks.
And slowly approached the entrance, extending my hand towards the translucent barrier.
I don’t know why, but.
Thud.
The cave entrance was blocked.
"…………Don’t be ridiculous."
What's the point if we can't escape?
Huh? You made an impossible boss to defeat, and now we can't even leave?
"Then what... is the solution…."
The feeling of something I was holding onto inside crumbling.
"B, Bjorn…"
But I smiled.
"Ah… Ainar? Don't worry! I'll break this damn barrier in a jiffy!"
The spirit of the barbarian is to break through anything that blocks your path.
Kwaang! Kwaang! Kwaang!
I punched the barrier with all my might.
"B, Bjorn…"
Sadly, the barrier didn't budge.
But not giving up is another virtue a barbarian must possess, you see.
"Le, ave…"
Fist, foot, forehead.
I used everything I could, charging towards the barrier, even ramming it with my shoulder, putting my weight into it.
Kwaaaang—!
Did it have an indestructible option?
'Okay, plan B then.'
I shifted my strategy, targeting the wall next to the barrier.
Even the most solid iron door, the stone wall it’s attached to isn’t the same.
Maybe there’s a solution there.
So.
"St, op…."
Kwaang—!
"Le, ave…."
"..."
"Be, fore… he…."
I couldn’t take it anymore.
Kwaaaang—!
I slammed my forehead against the wall, venting my frustration.
It didn’t make me feel any better.
I was still suffocating.
"Right… there…!"
At that moment, soldiers appeared from behind.
We’d managed to create a distance, but they were already here? That thought didn’t even cross my mind. With a sense of relief, I immediately charged at them.
Kwachik—!
I slammed the one in front into the wall and crushed him. After taking the weapon he was holding, I began a proper massacre.
“…D, demon!”
"Don't back down!"
"For the Empire…!"
One, two, three, four…
‘Five.’
Six, seven, eight…
‘…How many was it?’
I don't know, so back to the beginning: one, two, three…
Kwachik, kwachik, kwachik—!
Before I knew it, the surroundings were quiet.
Only corpses remained, and I couldn't even hear a faint breath.
Realizing something belatedly, I turned around.
“…Ainar."
I rushed over and, thankfully, she was still breathing.
Faintly, and roughly, as if it would stop at any moment.
"B, Bjorn…"
Ainar lifted her eyelids, trembling, as if she’d felt my arrival.
"..."
I couldn’t speak.
I should've said something.
Like, "You’re alright," "Don’t worry," or "We'll get out soon."
“Jandel’s, son… Bjorn.”
She stared blankly at me, as if her soul had left her body, and Ainar weakly twisted the corners of her lips.
"My... pr, ecious… fr, iend…."
It felt like a thick stake had been hammered into my heart.
Precious friend…?
“Yo, u’ll... be... a gre, at... wa, rri, or…."
Something I'd been holding back finally gave way.
***
The painful truth and sweet lies.
For someone facing death, it's clear which one is right.
But.
‘Precious friend….'
My mouth opened before I could even process that simple logic.
It was a confession and an apology.
"I’m… I’m not… that... person…."
The real Bjorn Jandel is someone else.
I’m just an evil spirit possessing his body.
That's right, the evil spirit you mentioned, the one that should be killed on sight, crushing its head right there.
That's… me.
I muttered those words for a long time, looking at Ainar, who was staring blankly at me.
Then, at some point, I snapped out of it.
"..."
Ainar was no longer breathing.
Her open eyes were still fixed on me, but denial was meaningless.
"The third pilgrim has died."
Ainar was dead.
And with that…
"The stats of the remaining pilgrims increase by +400."
My stats increased again.
This allowed me to learn…
"You are the sole survivor."
When my stats increase.
And...
"Special Condition - Perfect Bond achieved."
"All stats increase threefold."
"Defeat Centurion Dreadpier."
What was the solution to this hidden phase.
