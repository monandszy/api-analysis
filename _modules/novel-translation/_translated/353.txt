## Chapter 353: Dark Continent (4)
"Rihën, here's some water!"
"Ah, thanks."
As the explorers, including me, quenched their thirst with water or liquor and took a brief rest, individuals from the royal family circulated throughout the ship, conducting a headcount. And then…
"The ship will be immediately recalled after disembarkation, so please ensure you have all your belongings!"
After the headcount, we were directed by military officers to board smaller boats and transfer to the shore. On the shore, troops that had disembarked earlier stood in neat rows. Well, compared to the modern era where people walk with their left feet aligned, it was a rather chaotic sight. 
"Looks like they weren't waiting for us here."
"The other side seems to be avoiding direct engagement between their main force and ours."
"Well, if they clashed head-on, they would struggle to win with this number of troops."
Following the instructions, as we waited, the lead group began their march. We, however, did not follow. After all, the third-class vessel we had boarded today, officially designated as the 3-21 vessel, was tasked with escorting the Third Magical Regiment. Unfortunately, this Magical Regiment belonged to the Third Corps, and their primary mission was to secure the retreat. Simply put, once the main force departed, we would be left here to establish a base camp and protect this area, our role in this war.
"Alright, let's set up our tents first!"
Once the remaining vessels of the Third Corps disembarked, the earnest construction of our base camp commenced. The explorers built their tents with the supplies provided, while the magicians bustled around, drawing various magical formations.
How long had it been?
Swosh—!
The sound of the waterfall, once deafening due to magic, became notably quieter, and the fog that had obscured our vision completely dissipated.
"Whew, I feel like I can breathe again."
"Everyone, please relax and have some refreshments! We will be announcing tent assignments and mission details shortly!"
As the base camp construction neared completion, our tents were assigned. It was a six-person tent located in the eastern region, centered around the lake. Although we were under military control, our group of three were not separated, as per the usual practice of keeping team members together.
"Ha-ha, let's introduce ourselves. We will be operating as a unit from now on."
Three individuals I had never seen before joined us. It was not just a matter of sharing a tent, but also a requirement to move as a unit during watch duty or patrols.
'We must have been matched this way because we have three members.'
Clans, teams, or whatever unit you call it, the minimum unit size was five… no, six after the Binding magic update. Since we only had three, they automatically matched us with others. 
'Though it seems it's not entirely automatic.'
I observed the man, who, with a charming smile, effortlessly led the conversation. He wore an elegant uniform and a sword at his waist, but he was a magician. The Magical Regiment emblem pinned to his chest confirmed it.
"Ah, by the way, I haven't introduced myself yet. I'm Alex Hale, Deputy Director of the Third Magical Regiment."
"Deputy Director?"
As I muttered under my breath, Amelia whispered in my ear.
"It means Deputy Commander's aide."
Oh, so this guy is Raven's right hand? His purpose for sending his right hand here is obvious. To control and monitor us… or to be more precise, to control and monitor Erwën.
"The six assigned to this tent will be part of Unit 3-17 and will undertake various missions. As the unit leader, I will assist you all—”
"Unit leader? Who decided that?"
As Erwën asked, her voice laced with displeasure, the man's smile faltered.
"Ha-ha… I understand that there may be some dissatisfaction with that, but it's an order from above, so—”
"You seem relaxed as you smile, but you're quite tense."
"……What?"
"Why? Do I seem suspicious to you?"
The man hesitated for a moment before forcing a smile and shaking his head.
"How could I possibly think that? I'd be more inclined to say you inspire confidence."
It was obviously a polite remark. If he genuinely felt that way, there would be no reason to avoid Erwën's direct gaze.
"Alright, enough."
I quickly intervened, knowing that this man was simply following orders.
"But, three of us are enough…"
"It's always better to have more people."
"Still, unit leader…."
"It's not unusual for a military officer to lead a unit. Why are you so disgusted?"
"……Alright, alright, I'll stop."
Erwën glanced at me before clamping her mouth shut.
Had that scene impressed him?
Only then did the man turn his attention to me.
"You are…."
"Rihën Shüitz."
"Ah, yes... I know you. It's a pleasure to meet you. The person next to you is Ms. Emily Reigns, right?"
"That's right."
The man approached me and greeted us, then introduced the other two who had been silently watching the situation from afar.
"These two were aboard the third-class ship that sank on our way here. Thankfully, they were rescued, but unfortunately, they weren't able to save their other companions."
I had suspected they were from another team, but it wasn't a complete two-person addition. So that was the reason.
As our gazes shifted to the other two, they introduced themselves with a slightly nervous tone.
"It, it's an honor to meet Ms. Bloodwyrm. Ah, no, I mean, it's an honor to meet all of you, of course. I am a fifth-grade explorer named Lykion Elt."
He made a good first impression. He seemed polite and observant, considering he remained silent until the introductions were over. Fifth grade meant he could pull his weight. And considering his circumstances…
"We, we'll try our best not to be a burden! Ha, Hans Kaiser."
"What…?"
I unintentionally exclaimed, and the guy kindly introduced himself again.
"Hans Kaiser!"
Are you kidding?
***
I briefly thought back. What happened the last time I met Hans?
I remembered instantly.
Hans J, whom I met on Parune Island, was a traitor. And then….
'I was sucked back into the past after meeting that guy.'
I spent half a year there, and when I returned, two years and six months had passed in the original timeline.
No, that wasn't all.
Not only had my comrades scattered, but for some reason, I was branded with the Demonic Mark.
"Heh-heh…."
As I let out a dry laugh, Hans K tilted his head and asked.
"Um… why are you laughing?"
There was no reason to answer him, even if he went so far as to ask. It would only lead to unnecessary denials.
"Erwën."
"Yes, what is it?"
"Didn't you say three of us were enough before?"
"Yes, we did."
Right, that's what I said.
"Tsk…"
I pondered earnestly. A single word from me to overturn everything, and Erwën would tear this unit apart with a roar of fury. But…
'If I do that, Raven will hear about it.'
That fact was what truly troubled me. Raven was a comrade who knew about my Hans phobia. He might hear the details and grow suspicious of me.
'Oh, but wouldn't it work if it didn't seem like I kicked them out because of their names?'
That made sense, actually.
Alright, I decided.
"They're trash."
"……Excuse me?"
"It meant that having people like you around is just a hindrance."
As cold words of contempt spewed from my mouth, the two men stiffened. They couldn't have imagined, not even Erwën, that I would say such a thing.
"Ha-ha… what kind of nonsense is that? Mr. Shüitz, didn't you say before that more people would be good?"
Ah, that's what I said.
"I've changed my mind."
Hans is that serious.
As I demanded they leave or that we be separated from them, the man looked troubled. But…
"Unbelievable. You think you're something just because you're in her shadow?"
"Alright, we're out. There's no point in staying with you after such disrespect. Just make sure you tell the military that the problem lies on your side, not ours."
My words must have truly struck a nerve, as they made their own declaration of departure and left the tent.
Whew, that's one problem solved—
"He dared to speak like that. Should we go after them?"
"That's enough, don't even talk to them."
"Alright!"
As we were talking, I noticed Alex, Raven's right hand, staring at me with contempt. 
Ah, right. He must have heard Raven's accusations directly. I thought he seemed normal at first, but after this incident, he probably sees me as just a pathetic fool who relies on others' power.
"So what are you going to do now? You're down to four members in a unit that needs six."
"……I will report this situation to Deputy Commander and inform you about the arrangement later."
"In that case."
Alex left to report the situation, and Erwën cautiously asked me a question.
"But why did you suddenly act like that?"
"Didn't you hear? That guy's name was Hans."
"……Why does that matter?"
Does she not know about my Hans jinx? Hmm, come to think of it, I don't think I ever told her...
As I was about to explain, Amelia chuckled and spoke for me.
"You're telling me you didn't even know that was his comrade?"
"……So you're saying you knew?"
"Of course, I know."
Amelia shrugged and briefly explained the Hans jinx that I had.  In her case, she knew the weight of that name because of the incident where she called me 'I-Hans'. 
Erwën must have felt a pang of anger that she was the only one who was clueless.
"Hans…."
She muttered the name in a voice laced with killing intent and clenched her fist as if making a vow.
"Come to think of it, the traitor Hans Owlrock from Parune Island was also named Hans. I'm sorry. I will never forget it."
"Uh… yeah, alright."
I thought she might start stabbing every Hans she encounters in the forehead, but I decided not to worry about it too much. What difference does it make? It's Hans after all.  There's bound to be something wrong with him if you look closely.
'The problem is, I've already met Hans….'
They were quickly kicked out of the unit, but I had been in the same room with Hans K for too long. It was even indoors, with poor ventilation. Considering that we were in the middle of the 7th floor battlefield...
"Uncle, my hands are shaking…."
Oh, this is unbearable.
***
What else is going to explode?
Unable to rest comfortably due to that anxiety, I was shaking when…
"Your arrangements have been finalized."
Alex returned and informed us about the unit situation.
Nothing had changed significantly. The unit remained at four members, and he would continue to act as the leader. However…
"From now on, you… no, we will be assigned to a personal escort duty, not external patrols or watch duty."
Our unit assignment was changed to escorting Raven, the Deputy Commander of the Third Magical Regiment.
Of course, there was nothing wrong with that. With Commander Kyle having gone to support the First Corps' Special Forces, Raven was effectively the most important person in our unit.  Maybe he was calling for an escort just to keep an eye on us before we caused any trouble.
Yeah, that was fine up until that point.
Kaboom—!
The sound of magical cannons echoed from somewhere.
Beep—! Beep—! Beep—!
The alarm magic we had set up activated and echoed throughout the base camp.
"Ambush, ambush!"
"Everyone, prepare for battle!"
It had been less than two hours since I met Hans K.
