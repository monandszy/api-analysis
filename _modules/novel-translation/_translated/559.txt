## The First Clear (4)
I could hear sounds, a flurry of activity and commotion.
“………Warrior Ritman Powell confirmed!”
“Warrior Mylden Baltimore of the third squad confirmed!”
“Warrior Garon Nilgrain of the first squad confirmed!”
Grim voices echoed from all directions.
And then…….
“Mister! Snap out of it! Can you hear me?”
“Priest, why isn't he regaining consciousness?”
“I, well… if we wait a bit, won't he wake up soon……?”
“He hit his head hard, could that be the cause?”
“…….”
The worried voices of my comrades reached my ears. 
Amidst them, Misha’s murmur was discernible.
“…If something happens……. I’ll have to use that…….”
What was she talking about?
My ears were muffled, a result of finally regaining consciousness. 
My mind couldn't focus properly either.
“Well then… since the Baron seems to be alright, I’ll go attend to the other wounded—.”
“What nonsense! He hasn't woken up yet, where are you going?”
“Tercia, stop it.”
“Stop it, you’re not even worried about Mister—.”
“I don’t need to be. He seems to be awake now.”
“……What?”
Caught me. 
I was trying to regain my senses and open my eyes for a bit longer. 
Well, it was time to get a grip on the situation. 
No matter how long I closed my eyes and stalled, the outcome wouldn’t change.
“Captain!”
“Oh! Bjorn!! I was worried sick!!”
“Haaah…….”
As soon as I opened my eyes, my comrades let out sighs of relief, their faces full of emotional turmoil. 
However, I had something to ask before even mentioning that I was okay.
“Is anyone… injured?”
I spoke indirectly, but it was ultimately a question about whether there were any fatalities. 
Amelia understood immediately and responded.
“Glow Ishias is dead.”
Glow Ishias. 
One of the three mages of Armin's exploration team. 
A young mage in his thirties who always joked about needing more time and budget whenever he saw me. 
Right, he’s dead. 
“……And?”
“There are no other deaths. There are several injured, but besides one, they’re all minor.”
“I see…….”
I closed my eyes for a moment and exhaled deeply. 
During that time, my comrades didn’t say anything, resulting in a brief silence. 
Countless fragments of thoughts swirled, but I focused on one:
‘What needs to be done.’
……Let’s do what needs to be done. 
“I remember being bitten on the head by the beast, but what happened after that? Tell me everything, starting from the moment I passed out.”
For some reason, Amelia seemed hesitant as she began to explain.
“…As soon as you were bitten, Tercia fired an arrow.”
Just so you know, her [Focused Shot] wasn't fully charged at the time. 
But…….
“The arrow hit Kashan, making him let go of you.  Taking advantage of that, I and Calstain ran over and rescued you.”
That arrow created a brief opening, allowing me to survive. 
However, the real disaster began right after that. 
“…After that, we all faced the beast together, and quite a few people died. That’s all. Oh, and sadly, no essence—.”
“More details.”
We all faced the beast, and quite a few people died?
That’s not a story that ends in one line. 
I need to know. 
“Haaah…….”
Sensing my stubbornness, Amelia sighed and provided the answers I demanded.
“Jandel, when you fell, a huge gap opened up in the frontline. Someone had to fill it. Dozens of knights rushed forward.”
“What about Jerome Saintred? Was he still just watching from afar?”
“Surprisingly, not at all.  He said he was prepared for such an emergency, and when you collapsed, he was the first to charge forward.  If it weren't for him, we wouldn't have been able to rescue you.”
“…Is that so. Sorry for interrupting. Continue.”
“The commander got involved, but the situation was not good. And ultimately, an order came down not long after. All the troops stationed in the rear were to join the fight and attack the beast.”
The troops stationed in the rear to protect the ranged fighters like mages, priests, and psionics. 
Even they were mobilized for the full-scale offensive. 
I understood the rationale. 
After all, the battle was nearing its end. They must have thought that the sooner they killed it, the less damage it would cause. 
“But there was a fatal problem with that order.”
The problem was that there was no one in the exploration force who could manage the beast’s aggro. 
“Kashan prioritized attacking threatening individuals. Most attacks were aimed at the commander, but it was a very unstable situation.”
Like swatting flies, whenever the beast attacked anyone nearby, knights were decapitated. 
If mages unleashed a powerful spell, the beast would be enraged and charge towards them. 
“Glow Ishias was also hit by the beast at that time.”
The three mages became two. 
‘That’s why he didn’t mention the cause of death earlier….’
Was he thinking that Glow wouldn’t have died if I hadn’t been unconscious?
…Well, that is the truth. 
“You were unconscious for about three minutes while we fought the beast.  Finally, the commander's sword pierced the beast’s forehead, and it all ended. Immediately, the stone gate over there closed and reopened, emitting light.  About ten minutes have passed since then.”
“…….”
“Well, did that answer your questions?”
“For now, yes.”
Just as our conversation reached that point, a knight with a familiar face approached us.
“Baron! You're awake! The commander wants to see you!”
“…I’ll be back in a moment.”
“I'll take good care of the injured, so don't worry and go.”
Following the knight, I found Jerome sitting there receiving healing from the priest, with one arm gone and a hole in his stomach. 
This bastard got hit pretty bad too. 
“I’m glad you're okay, Baron.”
“Your condition looks worse than mine.”
Jerome just gave an awkward smile in response to my words. 
“Now that the Baron is here……. Evoust, start the report!”
With me included, all the commanders gathered in the room as the deputy commander started to announce the results of the battle. 
“The first exploration force achieved a feat that will be recorded in the history of the royal family, having slain Kashan, the prophesied wolf, today.  Sadly, the essence to be presented to the royal family was not discovered… .”
The report that followed made me realize once again the danger posed by a first-rate monster. 
“In this battle, we suffered a total of 28 casualties, including 27 minor injuries who have recovered and four major injuries still under treatment.”
28 casualties.
21 of those deaths occurred during the three minutes I was unconscious. 
***
Out of the 28 casualties, only one was from our fourth squad. 
It’s undoubtedly miraculous, but there was a decisive reason for this outcome. 
“Count Saintred, I heard it was you who ordered the fourth squad to the rear in the end.”
When I fainted and Kashan became uncontrollable, the commander sent our fourth squad to the relatively safe rear. 
“Why did you order that?”
It’s not that I have any complaints about the order, in fact, I’m grateful for it.  But I couldn’t help but be curious about the reason… .
“Well, if the Baron died, one of our exploration force’s objectives would have failed.  That’s why I ordered all members of the fourth squad to protect the Baron.”
“…What?”
“Baron, our exploration force didn’t come here just to hunt monsters. And I have never failed a mission except for once.”
His mental world was incomprehensible. 
Is the mission really that important? 
“It doesn’t matter how many people die, as long as we finish exploring this place and bring the Baron back alive, the mission is a success.”
I can’t understand this guy. 
Earlier, I thought we could be friends if it weren’t for our circumstances. 
“I understand.  You’ve answered my question.”
“Good. Now, shall we continue the meeting?”
Nodding, I took a step back, and the deputy commander, who was hesitant, resumed the meeting.
“The casualty report is done, so we’ll move on to the next agenda item.”
The next agenda item was very simple. 
Kashan was captured, and no essence was found, so there’s no need to discuss ownership. 
Therefore…….
“The stone gate opened as soon as Kashan was defeated.  The mages have confirmed that the luminous mass has similar properties to a portal… .  In other words, entering that luminous mass will very likely lead to a new space.”
What lies beyond the wide-open stone gate? 
And when is the best time to start the exploration?
Various opinions were exchanged during the meeting, but I just half-listened, lost in my own thoughts. 
After all, I already know what’s beyond the gate.
‘…I didn’t know the gate would open like this.’
It’s the same place I entered through with Hamsic.
Well, maybe it could be a completely different place, but I don’t think that’s likely. 
‘Maybe we get the reward inside after defeating the first-rate monster and clearing the library.’
Various summoning scrolls would be a good reward, and the fountain pen that allows guaranteed essence drops would be the main reward. 
Hmm, or maybe the main reward is that golden book. 
‘Anyway… did we kind of cut it short in the middle?’
If I hadn’t met Hamsic first and claimed the reward early, the royal family would have taken the fountain pen. 
‘The library has a hidden room that lets you skip the clearing and enter the main reward room.’
From the perspective of a player, that’s what Hamsic is all about. 
Of course, I think there are more hidden secrets. 
‘Maybe that’s why it said I was unqualified? Because I didn’t clear the library officially and entered the reward room.’
I’m just speculating, nothing is certain.
Therefore, I’ll have to meet Hamsic again and see his reaction… .
“Well, that concludes the meeting for today.  There are no missions scheduled until seven o’clock, so each squad leader should take care of their members. Oh, and you should know that there will be a personnel reshuffle later.”
After the meeting ended, I was granted some free time. 
‘Until seven o’clock… .’
These guys are tough. 
We fought a major battle, so they should let us have the entire day off, but they’re giving us a few hours of rest before sending us back on missions. 
Sighing, I relayed the news to my comrades.
“……Five hours isn’t even enough to sleep.”
“Huh?  Not enough to sleep? Just sleep, what’s the problem?”
“Today, Pnallin is right. I need to get some sleep.”
“But I don’t think I’ll be able to sleep.  I can’t believe it yet… . My heart’s still pounding.”
Most of them felt relieved to have some rest, however short it might be, despite the misfortune. 
“Sleep or rest, whatever, that’s your business. Let’s get one thing done first.”
“What needs to be done…….”
“One of our comrades is dead.”
“Ah… right… .”
Following that, I led all four squad members to a specific place. 
It’s where we laid Glow Ishias, the only casualty of our squad, to rest. 
Charlotte Amblut, the only female among the three mages, was sitting in front of the body, dazed. 
“Are you alright?”
“……No.  I’m not alright at all.”
“Is this your first time?”
It was a question packed with meaning.
Charlotte just clenched her fists, trembling uncontrollably, without an answer.
And how much time had passed? 
Her older brother, Brian Amblut, pulled the body away from his sister and started a simplified funeral. 
As always, the process ended quickly.
“The remains and his belongings will be returned to his family when we go back to the city.”
The funeral concluded by separating his belongings, placing the remains in a bone container, and applying a distortion magic. 
Just as I was about to leave, Charlotte approached me.
“Baron… . Will it be okay someday? Will it be okay someday when a lot of time passes? Like what people say?”
It’s the exact thought that comes to mind when experiencing this for the first time.
Pff, how should I answer that?
After carefully organizing my thoughts, I opened my mouth.
“The meaning of ‘okay’ varies from person to person.”
“Yes… . I guess so. I was just talking nonsense—.”
“But, you see, if happy memories come to mind before sadness when you think about him, and if you call that state ‘okay’… .”
I spoke to Charlotte with conviction.
“Someday, it will definitely be okay. Even if you don’t want it to be.”
“…….”
“Get some rest now.”
As I turned my back, someone approached me. Misha, the only member who was with me during our Team Half-Full days, among my current comrades.
“Was that… about Dwalki…?”
“…To some extent.”
As I gave an affirmative reply, Misha seemed to fall into thought for a moment, then she murmured softly.
“Those days… were really good… .”
A voice tinged with nostalgic longing. 
Of course, I was no different. 
“Yes… they were good.”
Now, I'm a baron, I have countless followers, I’m called a hero, my name is even engraved on the Stone of Honor.
But even so, I sometimes think back.
The days when we struggled to survive, fearing raiders, fighting against a fifth-rate monster, and all of us looking up at the sky on the third floor.
[You can only see this if you arrive early, right? Isn’t it a spectacular sight?]
I’m okay now.
***
I was trying to rest, using just a blanket, when an unwelcome guest arrived.
“Jandel, the chief mage of the exploration force is here.”
“The chief mage……?”
“He wants to talk to you, what are you going to do?”
“……I'm not sleepy anyway, this is good.  Bring him in.”
As I got up and started tidying my blanket, Amelia brought the mage in. 
“Gahwhin Besillerus.”
“Baron, sorry to disturb you while you’re resting.  Can we chat for a bit?”
The mage glanced at Amelia who was beside me. 
Amelia understood and stepped aside. 
“I’m about to use sound-proof magic, is that alright?”
“It’s fine, do it.”
“……Ah, thank you.  It’s done now.”
“So, what’s the matter?”
As always, I skipped the preamble and went straight for the reason for the visit. 
However, the mage said something quite unexpected.
“I’m here to apologize, Baron.”
“Hmm, an apology……?”
“Yes.  I was wrong, and you were right, Baron. But because I couldn’t accept that, I almost made a huge mistake.”
The apology was one thing, but I was more curious about his change of heart. 
“Why are you suddenly having these thoughts?”
“After seeing that, it’s obvious.  The first-rate beast… . It’s a monster beyond comprehension. I underestimated them.  You, who’s an explorer by birth, saw it more accurately than anyone.”
“I see.”
“To be honest… . Until you fainted, I didn’t realize how terrifying they were.  Or rather, I was arrogant enough to think that if I had summoned Leviathan as I said, even those few wouldn’t have died.  But…… .”
The mage continued, his voice filled with humility.
“It wasn't because of me, not at all. My knowledge, my magic skills, had no effect. Even over a hundred elite forces from the royal family were the same. I felt it deeply during those three minutes that you were absent.”
“That… . You’re making me sound too good.”
“As a scholar, I’m just stating the facts.  If it weren’t for you, Baron, things wouldn’t have ended with just that much damage.”
“…….”
It’s awkward to respond when someone compliments you like that. 
So I just kept quiet. 
If I keep quiet, they’ll eventually leave… .
“Ahem… . I’ve been talking too long.  Anyway, there’s one thing I want to say.”
“Get to the point.”
“The exploration force needs your strength, knowledge, and your judgment, Baron. I’ll be sure to listen attentively from now on, so feel free to voice any opinion.”
In other words, he's saying that he won’t be wary of me, so let's get along. 
I was delighted to hear that. 
“Good. I’ll keep that in mind, Gahwhin.”
“…Gahwhin?”
“Friends call each other by their names.”
“Ah, I see. Well… Bjorn—.”
“Just Baron will do. You’re a noble, aren’t you.”
“……Ah ha ha, you’re right. Thanks for taking the time to talk to me while you’re resting. I’ll leave now.”
As I was eating with my comrades, the designated rest time came to an end, and all members of the exploration force gathered in front of the stone gate, entering the portal one by one. 
「The character has entered the first record archive.」
Though I had some doubts, the place I entered after clearing the library was, in fact, Hamsic’s House, the same place I’d been before.
“This place is creepy.”
“It’s as if a typhoon swept through it.”
It was no longer the clean mini-library I’d seen on my first visit, but a ruin. 
However, the owner, Hamsic, and the golden book are nowhere to be found.
‘Well, he was outside last time, so he’s probably still hiding outside.’
Well, this is good. 
If the golden book were found here, the royal family would immediately claim ownership. 
“What a strange place. Isn't it, Baron?”
“It’s true.  I wonder what happened to make it such a mess… . Tsk tsk.”
“If you find anything, let me know.”
“I will.”
After inspecting the secret room and confirming that there was nothing threatening, the exploration force started a full-scale search. 
“There’s nothing left intact, I wonder if this search even makes sense… .”
“What nonsense are you saying? This is the first place we set foot in!”
“There has to be something, search thoroughly!”
By the way, the ‘thoroughly’ of royal soldiers is slightly different from that of explorers. 
They didn’t destroy anything. 
They just used their overwhelming inventory to collect everything.
“This book is just blank… .”
“Everything found here is the property of the royal family. Don’t leave a single speck of dust behind, take it all!”
It didn’t take long for the ruin to become an empty lot. 
“Search complete!  There are no hidden items!”
……Sorry, Hamsic.
