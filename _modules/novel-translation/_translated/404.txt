## Chapter 404: Dilemma (1)
The yellow light emanating from the signal ring meant only one thing.
Something bad was about to happen, but overcoming it would ultimately lead to a positive outcome.
'Could it be… that there's another traitor?'
This was the first thought that came to mind. 
I hadn't heard anything about an accomplice during the interrogation, but perhaps there was another spy from a different faction that this guy didn't know about.
If we failed to capture him, a negative event might unfold. Conversely, if we succeeded, it could lead to something positive. 
'…Well, maybe the signal isn't because of a spy.'
As someone bearing the responsibility of many lives, I considered the worst-case scenario, but decided not to dwell on it.
Nothing was certain yet. 
I would simply remain vigilant and keep a closer eye on my surroundings.
"Character has entered a special area."
"Field effect - Glacial Eye is applied."
The day after the execution, we packed up camp and entered a deep pit that seemed to extend to the inner core.
A field in the shape of a large cylinder.
We descended by spiraling down a series of ramps carved into the outer wall, akin to a staircase. It was the final gate to the 8th floor, and the difficulty was considerable.
The monsters themselves weren't significantly stronger than those we had encountered on the previous floors, but…
"Status ailment [Immortal Whisper] is applied."
A vicious curse that resurrected a character as an undead upon death, leading to team kills.
"Status ailment [Opportunity Deprivation] is applied."
Furthermore, the "Golden Time," referred to as a "count down," was nullified.
"All healing and recovery effects are reversed."
And, to top it off, this goddamn debuff was added.
'…What am I supposed to do if even natural regeneration works in reverse?'
Here, even minor wounds would never heal.
No, they would fester and worsen.
And the speed at which this happened would be directly proportional to the character's natural regeneration rate.
This was truly a graveyard for tanks.
'How many shield barbarians have we lost here…?'
Well, I didn't want to think about it.
Hundreds, for sure.
Until we finally discovered the solution.
"This place feels even creepier than the last one," Erwin commented.
"Erwin, stop talking and be vigilant. The monsters will appear soon. Like I said before—"
"Be careful not to get hurt, right? Hee hee, I got it."
“….”
With the narrow passage, the entire expedition team was divided into groups, following each other like a train.
Here, ranged damage dealers played a more crucial role.
Almost 90% of the monsters that appeared could fly.
"Gargoyles…!"
These were real gargoyles, not the 8th-grade monsters, 'Gargoyle Statues', that we encountered in the Crimson Fortress.
"There's a Death Knight too!"
A Death Knight wielding a spear, mounted on a gargoyle.
"[Kiihihiihiihi!]”
A Queen Banshee and various ethereal undead monsters, flitting through the air and spreading debuffs.
Flying monsters, the bane of melee damage dealers, emerged from various points, but they were intercepted and turned into orbs of light before they could reach us.
"James Calla has cast [Piercing Light]."
"Titana Akuraba is using [No. 1911, Paveler's Broken Pocket Watch]."
"The 5-minute cooldown is removed."
"Erwin Fornaci di Terzia has cast [Elemental Synthesis]."
Archers, Esper, Mages.
Not only did the expedition team have many ranged specialists from the start, but there were also four priests, ensuring that firepower wasn't an issue.
"Niaro Cambell has cast [Wave of Healing]."
"Benjamin Orman is casting [Emergency Regeneration]…."
"……. ”
Holy spells that dealt 1.5 times more damage to undead.
Of course, not every monster that appeared was undead, but it didn't matter.
We had enough damage output anyway.
"All healing and recovery effects are reversed."
Since we couldn't heal our own team here, the priest's role here was simply another ranged damage dealer.
"Gargoyle defeated +EXP 6"
"Ghost Horse defeated +EXP 4"
"White Wyvern defeated +EXP 6"
"Blue Flame Bird defeated…."
"……. ”
With high healing coefficients and area-of-effect holy spells, the monsters melted away.
The melee damage dealers focused on defense, handling the various beasts that climbed up the cliffs.
And…
"Combat end!"
"10 minutes of rest before we resume the journey!"
After each wave, we quickly finished our preparations and moved down.
How much more time passed?
Having overcome several waves without any casualties, we finally arrived at the first plateau.
The narrow ramp ended, and…
A wide rock face jutting out of the cliff.
And…
"This is insane. How am I supposed to fight all those things without getting hurt?"
Hundreds of monsters filled the space above.
The cave located on the cliff was the Glacial Eye's respawn area, so this was unavoidable.
"What are you grumbling about? We got here safely, resting all the way. Now it's our turn to suffer," Ainar said.
Ranged specialists shone on the ramp, but now it was time for melee damage dealers to show their worth.
"Formations!"
"Focus at all times! Unless you want to spend the rest of the week with rotting arms!"
We completed our formation, gathered the warriors in the front, and formed a shield wall.
And…
"Charge!"
We pushed back the monsters, securing some space.
Then, the melee began.
The warriors at the front, risking injury, held back the enemies, while ranged specialists poured firepower.
The battle difficulty was relatively low, thanks to our overwhelming power.
However, despite this…
"Damn it, my arm…!! AAAAAAAARGH!!"
A casualty occurred.
***
We had four casualties in total.
Three of them were classified as minor injuries, only minor cuts, and wouldn't lead to death.
We would reach the 8th floor in six days, as scheduled.
If they didn't suffer any further injuries, they would be able to hold out until their wounds healed enough to be treated, even if they festered.
The issue was the other casualty, classified as a serious injury.
"Am, am I going to die…?"
Rick Juggernaut.
The melee damage dealer from James Calla's team, already down one member due to Pike Neldaine's absence.
James Calla yelled with a grave expression, standing beside the man writhing in pain, clutching his broken thigh bone.
"There's no way you're dying! Don't worry, that's not going to happen!"
Yes, those two were old friends.
"Shwietz! We need to turn back and head upwards!"
"Why?"
"Why?! What do you mean? If we leave him, he won't survive until we reach the 8th floor!"
His voice, filled with desperation, made me chuckle involuntarily. Would this guy have reacted the same if someone else was injured?
Well, I'm not sure, but I think he would have made a cold, calculated decision.
Just like Akuraba over there.
"We already spent an entire day coming down here. Going back up and then back down means we'll lose two more days."
We would waste two days, collectively, for 28 people, to save one.
Well, that's not an issue in itself.
However…
"Calla, I'm sorry, but we only have enough food for five more days. Even now, we'll end up starving for a whole day."
As Kaislan just said, saving this one person wouldn't just cost us time.
It would cost us lives.
Even if we went a day without food, we wouldn't be able to continue the journey for three days without eating.
"Oh, all thanks to the traitor from whose team, I wonder?"
Is this guy even a paladin?
His sarcasm was…
"Enough about the traitor, let me ask you one thing, Calla. Did you think this expedition would succeed without any sacrifice?"
James Calla couldn't say anything in response, and Kaislan continued his cold, calculated speech.
"Furthermore, we're going to have more casualties. What are you going to do then? Turn back every time?"
James Calla couldn't answer again.
He just gritted his teeth, unable to hide his frustration.
The reality was merciless, with no one to help.
"Why not let him peacefully pass into God's embrace? If Calla can't do it, I'll lend a hand," Jun offered, as if suggesting to simply unplug the oxygen mask.
James Calla, trembling with misery, turned to me and asked.
"Shwietz. Do you think the same…?"
I didn't deny or affirm.
"Kaislan isn't wrong."
In extreme situations, this is usually the case.
There comes a time when we have to make a choice and sacrifice something.
However…
"Understood. I'll do it," Misha declared.
What are you saying?
"That's enough. It's not time yet," I said.
I couldn't let a valuable member die like this.
Sure, there's always a chance of dying during the expedition.
But not here.
“……Yes?”
Looking at James Calla staring back at me with a bewildered expression, I shrugged.
"We're not going back up, nor are we going to leave a comrade to die here."
The team leaders all wore the same expression when I said this.
'What the hell is this guy talking about?'
Exactly that expression.
Tsk tsk, that's why they're beginners.
"We're going to continue downwards."
It's time to use the solution.
***
'Glacial Eye' was my least favorite field.
Like I said before, until I discovered the solution.
"All healing and recovery effects are reversed."
Not for a short period, but a full week.
This kind of crazy penalty in [Dungeon & Stone] meant only one thing.
Convinced that a means to overcome it was definitely hidden somewhere, I tried countless times, finally discovering it.
It was a simpler solution than I thought.
"Distortion Magic… is it?"
"Yes, from now on, we're going to use Distortion Magic against all monsters during every battle."
"We're already quite worn out from using Preservation Magic. What's the reason for adding this burden here?"
Well, the core of the solution was 'distortion'.
Monsters affected by distortion wouldn't drop any magic stones or essence, but instead, there was a chance that their corpses wouldn't disappear when defeated, and instead, be preserved.
Wyvern hide.
Adamantium.
Troll blood, the raw ingredient for potions.
Various materials used for high-level soul engraving were the most representative byproducts obtained through 'distortion'.
And…
'The monsters appearing in the Glacial Eye can all be hunted on other floors.'
That was the reason it took me so long to figure out distortion was the answer.
'Using 'distortion' to obtain byproducts in a place with limited inventory space because you can't use 'Subspace'?
When you could just hunt them easier on other floors?'
This was an incredibly inefficient action.
But as usual, this goddamn game hid the answer in those inefficient actions.
“……I can't believe that there was a way to heal injuries like this."
Once I briefly explained the solution, everyone gasped.
Even though it was the first time they had heard it, no one doubted me.
"The Duke's information network is remarkable. Or should we say, the power of the Royal Family? To know this 'arrangement', hidden from even veteran explorers like us."
Just like they assumed there was another strategist on my team when I uncovered the traitor in detective mode.
They assumed that this solution came from a different source.
'…Maybe it's better if they misunderstand?'
Yeah, maybe that's better.
There's no benefit in showing off unnecessarily.
Humility is a virtue in Confucianism, after all.
"Well, that's that. Everyone's tired today, so we'll camp here tonight, and then we'll set out again tomorrow."
Assuming James Calla's friend could hold out for two days, we spent the night on the rock face and resumed our journey early the next morning.
And…
"Riard Ashid has cast 6th-grade Spatial Magic, [Upper Distortion]."
"Mackelly Reyaiders has cast 6th-grade Spatial Magic, [Upper Distortion]."
"Versil Goulend has cast 6th-grade Spatial Magic, [Upper Distortion]…."
As a result of repeatedly casting 'Upper Distortion', which had a 1.5 times higher chance of success than regular 'Distortion', we managed to preserve a corpse by the afternoon.
"Sh, Shwietz! Is this what you were talking about?"
James Calla, quicker than anyone else, rummaged through the corpse and found a bead. I quickly fed it to the injured man before it melted.
"Rick Juggernaut has consumed the 'Frozen Trace of Life'."
Okay, that's one person saved, and…
"Uh, what do we do with the rest of the byproducts?"
We decided to just discard the rest of the monster corpses.
We could sell them for a hefty price if we took them back to the city, but with our current situation, we couldn't carry any more baggage.
Of course, discarding them would be the—
Grrrumble.
Hmm, why am I so reluctant to do that?
As I searched for the reason behind my subconscious resistance, an idea struck me.
'It's meat, isn't it? It might be a bit rotten.'
I considered it a decent idea and rushed over to Amelia to share it with her.
"Emily! I've found a way to solve our food problem!"
"You, what kind of nonsense are you spouting this time…?"
"This isn't nonsense, I'm serious!"
"Ugh, tell me."
"It's…"
I explained the food supply plan I came up with to Amelia.
And…
Smack—!
I just got a smack on the back.
'…Is it really that bad?'
Tsk, it seemed like a good idea to me.
