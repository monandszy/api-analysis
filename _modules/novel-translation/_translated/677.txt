##  Chapter 677: Dream (4) 
The subsequent events could be summarized simply. Captain Kang granted my mother time to speak with me, and for a while, she profusely apologized. She explained why she left me that day, confessed her weakness, and lamented that she shouldn't have abandoned me. I listened to her words with one ear, nonchalantly brushing them aside. Or rather…
‘This is getting interesting.’
In my head, I ran simulations, refining any shortcomings or even overhauling the entire plan. Continuously observing my surroundings, I plotted escape routes.
How much time had passed, I couldn’t tell.
Knock knock knock.
Someone cautiously knocked on the interrogation room where my mother and I were alone.
“Hello, Han Soo.”
Who is this guy? He doesn’t look like a detective.
“Excuse me, but could you please step aside for a moment, Ms. Lee?”
“Oh, yes…,” my mother replied, leaving the room. A new face took her seat across from me, holding a thick stack of documents.
“I've heard everything, from your earlier testimony to the riot that happened just now. There are some intriguing aspects, so could we have a little conversation about that?”
A bespectacled man with a gentle expression and voice spoke, without revealing his own identity. 
Only then did I recognize him.
‘Mental evaluation.’ This guy is here to check my mental state. And depending on the results…
‘I’ll be shipped off to a mental institution.’ 
I quickly projected what might happen next. 
Would this mental evaluation be part of the ‘tutorial’?
‘…Impossible.’
Based on my gaming experience, it couldn't be.  If I applied this situation to a game, being sent to a mental institution would likely lead to ‘Game Over’. A sort of bad ending, you might say.  I could end up trapped in a hospital, forced to take medication, becoming a real mental patient.
Therefore…
“Yes, please ask me anything.”
I switched off ‘Barbarian Mode’ and activated ‘Gentleman Han Soo Mode’.
“Thank you. You seem much more polite than I heard.”
“That’s just me.”
Once the environment for conversation was established, the bespectacled man began to bombard me with questions.
“You said you were dragged into a game. Is that true?”
“No, it’s a lie.”
“Where were you then, during your disappearance?”
“I don't remember the exact place, but it was incredibly dark. I was trapped there, and the people who took me suddenly brought me back home. That’s why the riot happened, and I thought the guys who kidnapped me were back.”
“Hmm… Do you know why they kidnapped you?”
“No. I was simply kidnapped and imprisoned. You know that movie, the one where they only gave you dumplings? Yeah, just like that. They just locked me up and didn’t do anything else.”
“But why didn't you tell the truth during the investigation earlier?”
“They threatened me. They said they'd come back for revenge if I talked about them… I was too scared.”
The story was fabricated on the spot, but it was plausible.
However, the problem was...
“But can you tell me this? You said you were threatened.”
“Well, you seem trustworthy and kind… I, I decided to take a chance.”
I acted like an innocent young man, and the bespectacled man stared at me before slowly nodding.
“You thought I seemed trustworthy and kind… I see. Let's stop here for today.”
Oh, uh, um...
‘…I think I messed up.’
Sad premonitions rarely go wrong, and this time was no exception.
The bespectacled man, who had come for a mental evaluation, left. My mother was waiting outside after her visitation, and I was left in the detention cell to spend the night.
“Han Soo, come out.”
The next day, in the afternoon, I was taken out of the detention cell and transported outside.
“Captain Kang, where am I going?”
“…You’ll find out when you get there.”
Damn it.
‘I failed.’ 
If only I hadn't mentioned the game during the investigation.
Seeing me biting my lip and staring at the ground, Captain Kang seemed to decide that there was no point in hiding it, and offered me words of comfort.
“It’ll be much more beneficial for you in court if you stay well there. Attempted murder and aggravated assault… Even as a first offender, you wouldn’t have avoided prison time. So… Think of it as a place to rest your weary mind…,” she said.
Bullshit.
Rest my weary mind, my ass.
“I’ll visit often, and your mother especially will help you…,” Captain Kang said, her voice gradually fading, as I no longer had any reason to listen.
Thump.
A special transport vehicle was parked in front of the police station. People in uniforms stood in front of the car.
“This is a five-star, ultra-high-risk patient. Do not provoke him in any way, and be especially careful during transportation.”
The bespectacled man issued a stern warning to the uniformed men.
‘Five stars? Is this an Explorer’s Guild?’
I sighed, but still scanned my surroundings.  The men in uniforms were preparing something like a straitjacket from the car.
‘I guess they’ll uncuff me and move me there when they’re done.’
But because of that, I had to act one step faster this time. They might uncuff me soon, but they’re not idiots.
Knowing this was the most dangerous moment, they’d carry out the process much more meticulously.
So…
‘Now.’
I turned around and looked at Captain Kang.
“Han Soo? Do you have anything else to say…?”
“I, I… thank you for being kind to me.”
“No, it’s my job. You don’t have to thank me.”
“My job…,” I repeated. It made me feel a bit better. Just as Captain Kang did her ‘job’, I was just doing mine.
Crack-!
I slammed my forehead into her face, a move I often used during my early Barbarian days.
“Ugh!”
“Kyaaak!”
I pushed the seated Captain Kang back and she fell to the ground. I reached for her waist, where I had previously noticed something...
“Why isn’t it there?”
What the hell?  This wasn’t in my plan.
“Uh…,” she said, genuinely flustered, looking around.
“Ugh…,” Captain Kang groaned.
“C, Captain Kang!”
“This son of a bitch again!”
Captain Kang covered her nose, which was bleeding from my headbutt, and held back her colleagues.
“That’s enough! Stop it!”
“B, but…!”
“I said stop!”
Captain Kang slowly pushed herself up from the ground, looking at me. 
“…I thought Han Soo might do this, so I gave the keys to another colleague.”
Oh, I see.
“I’m not blaming you, Han Soo. It just hurts. If you listen to the teachers there and just take your ‘medicine’, you’ll get better soon.  You will, Han Soo.”
I’m screwed.
***
White and white.
A pungent smell of disinfectant fills the air everywhere.
“Aaaaaargh! Aaaaaargh! Aaaaaargh!”
The screams of a patient in the next room, who was having a seizure as usual, served as my lullaby as I gazed out the window made of special glass.
“Heehee…,” I chuckled.  
A drowsy afternoon, too languid to be described simply as ‘drowsy’.  
A muscular man in a nurse’s uniform stood in front of me with a chart, accompanied by a new nurse who looked foolish.
“Here’s the patient, Han Soo, that I told you about. Remember what I told you about how to handle him?”
“Do not engage in personal conversations with him!”
“You were at a different hospital, but be especially careful with this one. As Professor Park said, he's a patient who's as adept at deceiving, lying, and acting as he is at breathing.”
“Is, is that so?”
“Yes! He’s docile now because he’s on medication, but he’ll try to escape whenever he gets the chance. He thinks reality is a game. If he had a knife, he’d stab us, laugh, and say, ‘Gotcha! One down!’”
“Y, yes, I understand!”
“Don’t take me lightly!  Apparently, he beat up three police officers during his arrest, and choked one of them until he almost died.”
“Oh, I heard about that. Apparently, he was making a fuss even while leaving the police station, and even here in the hospital, there were several incidents where nurses were seriously injured…,” the new nurse whispered. 
“Well, at least it's a good thing, right? Because of that, we’re able to give him strong medication. He’s all docile now, see?”
“Yes. He’s not even looking at us while we talk.”
Of course, he won’t look at me, if he does, I won’t be able to speak.
Even conversations like this can be considered information…
“Yaaawwn…,” I yawned.
I’m tired to death.  I’m good for today, so I’ll go to sleep.
‘How many days have passed…?’
I didn't know for sure, but rest is part of the battle.  As I closed my eyes and embraced the approaching sleep, I thought to myself.
‘Stay sharp.’  
No matter what anyone says, this is a dream world.  I'm still in the middle of a trial, and as always, I'll find a way to overcome it.
However…
“It's time for Han Soo’s medication. Open your mouth!”
“Ah…,” I mumbled.
Gulp!
“…He’s just pretending to swallow. Kim Gwan!  Get that!  We have to force it down today.  Bind his hands and feet for an hour so he can’t vomit!”
Is it because of the antipsychotic medication I get every day?
I sleep when I'm sleepy, and I'm groggy when I wake up.  My daily routine involves being tied to my bed all day, with no more walks.  Gradually, I couldn’t help but question…
‘Is… this really a dream…?’
My mother, who comes to see me and cries every time she can.
All the memories and experiences I gained in Laphdonia.
They all tell me that this situation is a dream, but one crucial inconsistency made me confused.
‘Why…?’ 
Why isn’t anyone trying to kill me?
***
Death if I make a mistake.
Death if I’m unlucky.
Death if I just don’t know something.
A world filled with death flags.
[Dungeon & Stone].
My body is still in that world, and this whole thing makes no sense if it's just a dream. Why am I still alive?
One day, two days, three days, four days…
Why, no matter how much time passes, is there no one who tries to kill me?
The detective who got headbutted, Captain Kang who was almost strangled.  Why are they all so non-violent?
‘It’s as if…,’
I came to the real modern world.
No, to be more precise…
‘As if I really… went crazy.’
No matter how much I try to keep my mind clear, I can’t help but think that.  It could just be because of the medication, but…  As the doctor, nurses, detective, and mother said…
“Is there really something wrong with my mind?”
Actually, when I think about it, it’s not that unbelievable.  Rather, it’s conceivable, you might say.
A childhood that was so unlucky and terrible that it can't be explained by words like stress or trauma.  
Games that I became obsessed with as a way to escape.
Especially [Dungeon & Stone], which I played with near-obsession.
The break-up with Hyun Byeol during the game.
If all these things combined led me to go completely crazy, it’s not a strange story.  No, even if they weren’t psychiatrists, everyone would understand and agree that it’s reasonable.
“So… Were all those things in there… really because I was crazy…?”
“Everyone, cover your ears! Han Soo seems to be up to something again!”
“Yes!  He’s pretending to be fine and trying to make us relax!”
No matter how the hospital staff reacts, I shook my head, trying to hold on to the part of me that didn’t want to give in.
‘No, that’s not it.’
I didn’t come back.  This is still a dream.  If I accept this as reality, the ordeal ends.  From then on, Game Over is inevitable.
So…
‘I need proof.’
To steel my resolve, I need evidence.  I need a solid foundation to prevent myself from collapsing.
“Letter… Please deliver the letter.”
“A letter? To your mother?”
“No… Overseas. It’s fine to open it and see the contents, just please send it by international mail.”
“The address… Canada? Is this a letter for the ‘Canadian friend’ you mentioned before?”
“Yes, please.”
“…Alright. I’ll make sure to deliver it.”
Did he think the letter would help my treatment?  My doctor readily agreed to my request, and about two weeks later, I received a reply.
[I don’t know where to start. Hi, Han Soo.]
[I was shocked to see your letter. At first, I thought my friends were playing a prank on me… but if what the doctor sent with it is true, I feel like I have to reply. So, I'm writing this.]
[But your doctor might not like this. To be honest, I thought for a moment that you might be telling the truth.]
[It just doesn't make sense, right? I played [Dungeon & Stone] too, and I was in the related community, so you could have looked up my name and address online.]
[But my first kiss was at 17.  The person was my girlfriend’s best friend.  I wanted to be a veterinarian after my puppy died when I was a kid.]
[I’ve never told anyone this. Not on the internet, not even to my close friends.]
The Canadian friend’s reply provided the definitive proof that I was trapped in a ‘dream’.
Right?
If everything I experienced was an ‘illusion’, how could I know about the ‘Canadian friend’ on the other side of the ocean?
“Whew…,” I sighed.
Okay, I’m not crazy.  So, let’s focus on figuring out how to escape.
I continued to read the letter.
[But even though your words sound convincing, I hope it’s not true.]
[If what you said is true, then I’m already dead in that world, and I’m a fake created now… That would be too sad, right? I have a family I love, and a girlfriend.]
[I don’t know about you, but I think this is real.]
[Of course, it's your choice what you believe is real.]
[Oh, and if you need someone to talk to, feel free to send me a letter anytime.  I don’t even know your face, you’re on the other side of the ocean, but I feel like we could be good friends.]
[P.S. I heard about your childhood too.  You seem like a very strong person. So, I believe you’ll overcome it and I’ll cheer you on from afar.]
After reading the entire letter, I sighed deeply.
“Whew…,” I sighed.  This is frustrating in its own way.
