## Chapter 704:  The Eve of the Storm
“Excuse me… what kind of materials are you referring to?”
“Ah, here are the notes I compiled on the remaining materials. Would you like to take a look?”
“Yes, I'll take a look.”
After the GM handed her the notebook,  Lilith Malone, who had raised her hand, accepted it and read through it for a long time before nodding. 
“So we don't have to worry about materials then?”
“Really? Is that true?”
“Yes. I knew beforehand about the damaged magic circle, so I packed as much as I could when we left. The only thing missing from the list is the Pompura spores. But… since we need them for their magical stabilization properties, we could substitute them with Lapion Wind Crystals, right?”
“Yes, yes! That’s right! Wind Crystals will do!”
Oh, this is a twist I hadn't anticipated.  It seems like we could begin repairing the magic circle right away.
The only issue is… ‘What should I do?’  We have more options, but deciding which to take isn’t easy. 
It’s not like I feel safe just because we’re in a city. I know why Baekho was so eager to return to the city.
[Once the preparations from Noahrk’s side are complete, they’ll march on the Imperial City of Carnon and kill the King of Raphdonia.]
Whether Baekho is in the city or not, some ‘event’ will happen. ‘They said a year later, which was over nine months ago…’.
Now there are only about three months left.  In any case, even if we can go back now, it’s not easy to choose to go back to the city.
But… ‘I don't want to stay here either.’ In a way, the outside of the wall feels even more dangerous than the city. 
Since a monstrous creature so dangerous that Noahrk lost thousands without even putting up a fight could appear outside the wall. Should we stay outside the wall?
Or should we enter the city?  Ultimately, we have to choose one of these two options…
“Havellion, how long will it take to repair the magic circle if we start right away?”
“It won’t take long. Since it’s been a while already, natural restoration has progressed considerably.”
“Tell me the exact time.”
“We can finish within a week.”
Hmm, I see.
“Then start right away. If you need help from Vercil or Malone, ask them anytime.”
“Yes, I understand.”
Still, I gave the order to start the magic circle repair work immediately. Whether we head to the city or stay outside the wall, it’s right to fix the magic circle first.
“Then that’s all for the meeting today. Everyone relax and rest!”
It was sooner than expected, but I ended the meeting quickly. After all, the options are down to two, right?
Before deciding which one to choose, there was someone I needed to talk to first.
“Sven Parav.”
A knight from the Reathlas Church, and the Goblin Mask.
“Yes…? I haven't done anything.”
The moment I called his name and approached, he started to defend himself as usual. Seeing this, I can't help but wonder what kind of guy he is…
Surprisingly, he has one unique skill.
“Don’t worry, I’m not here to blame you.”
“Then… is it about ‘that’?”
“Yes. Are you still getting that ‘feeling’?”
Sven Parav has a ‘sixth sense’ that borders on ‘precognition’. It’s not an all-encompassing sense, however.
He can sense a ‘future crisis’ he will face, with an accuracy bordering on the supernatural.  What about this time?
“Well… I don’t know for sure yet. It hasn’t activated yet… ”
“…I see.”
“If I get that feeling, I’ll immediately run to you and tell you.”
“Alright, I understand.”
I’m a bit disappointed that I won’t be able to rely on his intuition for making this choice, but it also brings some relief. ‘Not yet…’.
Yes, at least not yet. It’s time for the events written in the records to unfold.
Day after day, a week passed, and finally, on the seventh day.
“It’s all done. We can return to the city as soon as we activate the magic circle.”
The GM informed me that the magic circle repair was complete.  Incidentally, the GM’s expression was quite animated as she delivered this news.
It seems she’s overjoyed to finally be able to return after this long journey…
“Yes…? What do you mean?”
“Exactly what I just said. We’re not going back to the city right away.”
“…Yes?”
As the one who dragged the reclusive GM out of the city walls, I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t feeling guilty. But there’s nothing I can do about it.
“If you’re not going back, then… what are your plans?”
“We’re going to stay here and wait.”
“May I know the reason?”
“I can’t tell you yet.  I’ll answer once things become clearer.”
I continued to wait, without even explaining the reason. Day after day, a week, two weeks, three weeks…  Such a tedious time, doing nothing but ‘waiting’. 
But for me, these days felt like the calm before the storm. I could feel it, intuitively, even if it wasn’t as precise as Sven Parav’s sense.
Thump—any day now. Swoosh—  I felt an ominous sense that something was about to happen. A month passed, then two months, and then…
Swoosh—the gentle breeze suddenly turned fierce.  The sky darkened at the same time. Whoosh—
As if the day of judgment had arrived, dark clouds gathered, forming a massive storm cloud.
“Is it going to rain, perhaps?”
“…That doesn’t seem to be the case….”
“Does anyone know anything about this change in weather?”
The sudden change caused immediate commotion around us. I searched for someone among the members who had come out of the barracks. Sven Parav.
Finding him wasn’t difficult.  I opened the barracks door and saw him trembling under the blanket, as if he had a cold.
I knew it as soon as I saw him.
“I, Lord… ”
Sven Parav’s ‘sense’ had finally activated. But the problem was…
“W, we need to get out of here….! No, I mean… if we get out of here, where to… ? There, there’s nowhere to escape to…?”
This seemed to be the first time I saw him lose his composure like this.
“Calm down, and tell me.  What do you mean by there’s nowhere to escape to?”
“We, we’re going to die! Here… ! Even if we leave and head to the city…!”
