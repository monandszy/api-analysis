## The Gate (2)
My mind suddenly goes blank. Even when I woke up in a stranger's Barbarian body and had to undergo a nameless coming-of-age ceremony, my mind had functioned perfectly. Now, it feels like my thoughts are steeped in alcohol, unable to string together a single coherent thought.
For a moment, silence stretched between us.
"... "
Misha stared up at me with eyes full of both fear and expectation. Unable to bear the intensity of her gaze, I finally managed to speak.
"... So that's it, then."
It was a meaningless murmur, neither an affirmation, a denial, nor a question. To think that after such a long silence, all I could manage was 'So that's it, then.' It had been a long time since I felt so ashamed of myself.
Even so, my mind finally started to function normally, thanks to her words.
'Yes' and 'No.'
Right now, my immediate task isn't choosing between those two.
If what Misha said is true.
No, considering how the Twisted Trust is working, it must be true…
Yet, there's a part that I still can't grasp.
"Then," I began, my voice laced with a hint of frustration.
"... What?" Misha asked, her eyes widening.
"Then... why did you distance yourself from me back then?"
It was a question I had been harboring for a very long time. Why did Misha push me away that day? At the time, I could even entertain the notion that she just didn't find me attractive as a man. But now… it seems like that wasn't the case.
"Ah... well...," Misha stuttered, her voice a mere whisper.
"It was because I... I found out you were an Evil Spirit... well, not an Evil Spirit... a player...," she trailed off, her cheeks flushing with embarrassment.
"A player...?" I tilted my head in confusion.
"I heard you dislike being called an Evil Spirit... am I wrong?"
Well, I'd never really thought about it, but 'player' certainly did sound better than 'Evil Spirit.' But was this something I'd heard from Baekho? It felt vaguely unpleasant, knowing it came from him.
"I... I won't call you that anymore if you don't like it. I'm sorry...," Misha mumbled, her voice laced with genuine remorse.
I tried to refocus the conversation, pushing past this irrelevant detail.
"... Okay, but what does you knowing I'm an Evil Spirit have to do with it? Fine... I understand that your feelings about me might be different, but did you think you couldn't be with me because I'm an Evil Spirit?"
I tried my best to keep my emotions in check, but I couldn't help but let some of my frustration seep through.
Misha recoiled, her voice rising in a panicked shout.
"That, that's not true!"
She was so taken aback that she sounded almost like her former self. Her voice, which had been elevated for a moment, fell into a softer murmur as she blushed.
"I... I just... couldn't bear to watch... you weaken because of me...," she confessed, her eyes fixed on the ground.
"That requires a bit more explanation," I stated, my voice neutral, my tone unwavering.
Misha, her voice faltering, began to explain herself, her words tumbling out in a rush of anxiety.
It was a simple story, once you dissected it.
"You switched faces with Charon even though you were pretending to be fulfilling your 'duty,' and you thought it was because of me. You thought that kind of action didn't benefit me, so you kept me away. Because I might expose your true identity someday," I summarized.
"Yeah...," Misha mumbled, her head bowed, though her eyes still met mine.
"But... maybe I was wrong...," she added, a flicker of hope in her voice.
Whew, how am I supposed to respond to this?
To be precise, the day I switched faces with Charon using the Golden Mask was all GM's doing. He needed an alibi for me to avoid suspicion.
But...
'It's not a lie, though.'
I've never really 'fulfilled my duty' in the Sanctuary. The first reason was that I found it uncomfortable as a modern human, and the second was Misha. I just felt… like I was committing a great sin, so I never did.
"You weren't wrong... good...," Misha breathed a sigh of relief, her gaze fixed on my expression. It struck me as I observed her reaction that time was slipping away.
It hardly mattered now, but...
I wanted to dispel every doubt, even if it meant appearing a bit cowardly.
"So, is that all?" I asked, my tone sharp.
"What?" Misha looked confused.
"Maybe there were... other reasons you pushed me away...," I added, my voice trailing off as I gazed at her with a mixture of hope and suspicion.
I could sense it. There was something else.
As I waited for her to speak, Misha's face flushed a deep crimson, and she finally broke the silence, her voice barely a whisper.
"You… you see…," she began, her gaze fixed on the ground.
"... "
"I... I can't have children...," she confessed, her voice laced with shame and resignation.
My mind went numb.
Even if an Ogre had hit me with a wooden club, I doubt I'd have felt this much shock.
"Children...?"
"Don't, don't misunderstand! I don't mean I can't have children, it's just... the children I have won't be Barbarians...," she clarified, her voice a frantic squeak.
I understood the meaning of her words. She was talking about the Barbarian's racial characteristic. Barbarians are only born to Barbarian women.
Even though I understood the meaning, I still couldn't grasp the logic.
"What does it matter whether my children are Barbarians or not?" I asked, my voice laced with disbelief.
Misha flinched at my sharp tone.
"Wh... What? Doesn't it matter?"
Of course it didn't.
I'm not a real Barbarian either.
Whether my child is a Barbarian or a Red Cat, I'll love them with all my heart.
But Misha couldn't bring herself to believe my words.
"That's a lie... don't men care about that sort of thing?"
Well, for Misha, who was born and raised in this world, it was probably a natural thought.
But...
"My world was different," I replied.
"But... you're a noble now... Surely, people would gossip and judge—"
"Stop." I put an end to this conversation.
I found the topic of children awkward and even embarrassing, given the current circumstances.
"Let's not talk about this anymore," I said, my voice firm.
"Oh... okay... Yeah, right? You... you don't even like me anymore...," Misha mumbled, her voice filled with self-pity.
"To be precise, I haven't answered your question yet," I corrected her, my tone softer.
"... Then? What's your answer?"
"Before I answer, there's something else," I said, looking at the Twisted Trust, the timer ticking away.
"Are you still hiding something from me?"
Misha answered without hesitation, her voice clear and resolute.
"No."
Yes, this is all.
The fact that I doubted her, thinking she was hiding something, makes me look like a fool.
Click.
The Twisted Trust's needle reached its end, and the light faded.
"So... will you... answer me now?"
I couldn't bring myself to meet her eyes.
Misha looked at me as if my answer was the most important thing in the world.
'I have to answer...,' I thought.
The Twisted Trust was no longer active. Even if it was still functioning, it wouldn't have meant much to me.
"My answer is..."
I poured my heart out, my voice trembling slightly.
***
It was like I was under a spell. A terrible, malignant curse, no doubt.
[Bjorn Jandel. I… I like you too.]
[Bjorn Jandel. I… I like you too.]
[Bjorn Jandel. I… I like you too.]
I could douse myself in ice-cold water, wear a steel helmet, and bang my head against the wall a hundred times, yet those words still echoed in my ears.
Oh, and those final words Bjorn had spoken:
[…So that's it, then.]
It wasn't an affirmation.
It wasn't a denial either.
But Erwen felt a profound sense of relief in his voice. If she was reading him correctly, Bjorn felt a sense of release in that moment. A release from the words of Misha Kalstain, the treacherous woman.
"………………."
What had happened between the two of them?
And what was the meaning of that 'So that's it, then'?
Even with all her worries and anxieties, Erwen couldn't figure it out.
Bjorn's words, echoing in her ears, had chased her out of the room.
"………………."
Why had she left?
Why hadn't she stayed and heard it all?
Though she regretted her decision now, she wasn't sure if she would have acted differently even if she could go back in time.
Because she was still afraid.
Afraid that something terrible, something irreversible, would happen if she heard the truth.
"Erwen Fornaci di Tercia."
And so, she didn't seek out Bjorn right then. Instead, she wrestled with her anxieties and fantasies before fleeing to Amelia's room.
"How long are you going to keep brooding like this?"
Amelia Rainwales. A plunderer from Noirarc, she had found a new life alongside Bjorn and was now known as Emily Rains.
"If you have something on your mind, just tell me. If I can help, I will," Amelia offered, her voice laced with genuine concern.
"………I'm fine."
Erwen ultimately turned away, and Amelia didn't stop her, simply suggesting that she come back whenever she felt like talking.
But Erwen had no intention of returning.
Coming here today was simply a lapse in judgment, a momentary lapse in sanity.
"………."
Erwen returned to her room, where she continued to torment herself, but she eventually reached a conclusion.
It was impossible.
Bjorn couldn't be with that Red Cat woman. It was preposterous.
What was it that she was lacking?
Once she reached that conclusion, a sense of relief washed over her, and she was finally able to leave her room.
But…
"Oh... ?"
As she descended to the first floor, her gaze fell upon a couple seated at the table, engaged in a lively conversation.
"Ugh… Stop laughing! I told you to make it for me. It's been a long time since I made it, so, I might have made a mistake… I, I didn't have the right ingredients in the Labyrinth... But, i, it's too salty, isn't it?"
"Don't worry. It's delicious enough," the man reassured her.
The woman had seemingly cooked him something that reminded him of a particular memory. As Erwen watched from the stairs, her gaze met the woman's.
"Ah, Erwen...," the woman said, her voice a mix of surprise and hesitation.
As their eyes met, the woman started to serve the food on a plate.
"If you haven't eaten yet, do you want some? There's... a lot left over..."
Something about the woman's actions triggered a memory within Erwen.
"Ah! If it's because of that steel helmet, I— "
"I don't need it," Erwen interrupted, her voice cold and sharp. 
She turned back and climbed the stairs. She felt an urge to throw the plate, but she managed to control herself. It was enough of a victory to simply hold back.
Click.
Erwen entered Amelia's room, the door clicking shut behind her. Amelia seemed surprised to see her return, but it hardly mattered right now.
"Amelia Rainwales," Erwen stated, using Amelia's full name, a name she never used in casual conversation.
Erwen remembered the time when she was learning from her sister after leaving Bjorn. The Red Cat woman had acted like the mistress of the house, treating Erwen like a mere guest.
"... I need your help."
She couldn't return to that time, not anymore.
***
After Erwen disappeared back upstairs, Misha looked at me with a worried expression.
"I... I hope she's okay...," Misha mumbled.
"Don't worry. I'll talk to Erwen, and you're good. And… good job," I said, giving her a reassuring smile.
"... What?"
"I mean, offering her food. You knew she hated you, but it wasn't easy to do that," I said, my voice laced with warmth.
"Oh, that… It's nothing. I can't keep doing this forever… We'll have to get along eventually…," Misha muttered, fidgeting with her fingers as she scratched the table. I found even her nervousness endearing.
I'd just told her to try and get along with the other members of the clan, and already, she was trying to make an effort. Though it was still a little awkward between us.
"………."
"………."
The silence, while not entirely comfortable, wasn't unbearable either. I found myself replaying our last conversation in my mind.
I still felt a bit foolish about it, but my answer back then was 'I don't know'.
[I don't know... what does that even mean?]
It's not that I dislike her.
The remnants of those feelings from back then still linger.
But, it's merely a relic, nothing more.
[A lot of time has passed since then... ]
Ever since that day, I've tried countless times to erase the feelings I harbored for Misha, and I actually succeeded.
I don't know what the future holds, but for now, the feelings I have for her are more akin to those I have for a fellow comrade.
Amelia, Erwen, Ainar, Raven…
If any of them were in Misha's position, I would have felt the same struggle and acted similarly.
In any case, that's not the point.
[Ha, ha... W, well… I, I guess there's nothing I can do about it… ]
Misha, hurt by my honesty, shrank back, but she managed to end the conversation gracefully.
[But… we're still friends, right?]
[What?]
[I mean, we… we started out as friends back then….]
[Ah, yeah….]
To be honest, I responded like an idiot back then with a ‘Y, yeah…?’
Thinking back, I just want to grab something heavy and throw it at a wall.
But what can I do about it? It's already done.
"Finished? Want more?" I offered, pushing a plate of food towards her.
We were in the middle of our silence, just the two of us, when I heard a voice.
"Jandel, you were on the first floor? I was just looking for you," said Versil, who had just come in from outside, having been out since morning.
"The Count of Saintred called. He said his research on the dimensional obelisk is finally finished. He wants us to come," Versil informed me.
"Research is finished... do you know what happened?"
"Not exactly, but I think it failed," he replied.
"I see… Well, I'll go and find out. I'll be back," I said, rising from my chair.
"Okay… Take care," Misha said, her voice a soft murmur.
Versil tilted his head, looking at both of us.
"You two..."
"Something you want to say?" I asked, my tone light.
"... No. Nothing at all."
I chuckled at his response.
As if.
"I'll tell you when I get back. We can talk then," I said, trying to push past the awkwardness.
I could already guess what he wanted to talk about. He was probably worried about Misha, suspecting she might be a traitor, and he probably wanted to share what happened in the community yesterday.
'I'll tell him that he doesn't have to worry anymore when I get back,' I thought to myself.
I headed towards the mansion where the dimensional obelisk was kept, and the chief awaited me on the first floor.
"You're here."
"Cut the pleasantries and tell me what you want," I said, my tone demanding.
The chief finally spoke, informing me that the ten-day long research on the dimensional obelisk had failed and that he had decided to leave the village today.
"Today?"
"I had a glimmer of hope, but it was a complete failure, so we can't waste any more time," he said, his tone unwavering.
Well, that makes sense.
Even I hadn't anticipated staying here this long.
"So, I wanted to get your opinion before we left. I don't plan to interfere with your exploration. Where would you like to go next?"
I'd had a good amount of time to relax and unwind.
It was time to resume my exploration.
