## Chapter 362: Interrogation (4)
Aruua Raven turned her back again. 
Even as she averted her gaze, the man continued to stare at her, his eyes filled with a profound sadness that bordered on despair.
“... ”
The sensation was like a sharp object piercing through her insides. “Why is he looking at me like that…  It’s me who was betrayed…  ” 
Evil Spirits are creatures who deceive the entirety of this world. She had been taught this from a young age, and she’d seen countless examples of it throughout her life. 
He saved me because I was in danger? 
“...  There’s no way that could be true… .”
She shook her head, forcibly pushing away the nagging voice in her heart,  as if trying to implant the thought that it was the only possible answer. The man simply said what he wanted to believe, that’s all. He must have had another agenda. She couldn’t let him fool her.
With these thoughts swirling in her mind, she took a heavy step forward.
Thud.
With each step, her memories of their shared adventures flashed before her eyes.  It all began with the blood-red castle where they first met.
[“What in the world is that thing?! Why is a vampire here… ?”]
[“Stop whining and move, Dwarf.”]
The vampire appeared as a guardian, a protector of the first-floor rift. The man naturally took the lead, throwing himself into the fight, ultimately securing victory. 
But… 
[“That holy water he used at the end… maybe I knew he was an Evil Spirit all along.”]
In the end, it always comes down to this.  Upon closer examination, the truth behind each cherished memory was deceit,  a reminder of how she’d been tricked, deceived. How foolish and easy she must have seemed to him.
Thud.
Granted, she owed him her life after the incident at the blood-red castle. However, Raven made a cold assessment.
[“…He didn’t sacrifice himself to save us, or anything.”]
He had no choice but to fight, or he would have died too. That was why he fought with his life on the line.
Thud.
Next, her mind drifted to the time they were trapped in the first-floor crystal cave.  A desperate situation, with the knights and the major clans abandoning them as pawns, escaping through the dimensional portal.  It was the day he became the city’s hero.
[“What do you want us to do?!”]
[“I said it once—! Everyone stop—!!”]
He stood his ground, his voice strong and unwavering, uniting the explorers who had been at each other’s throats moments before.  They broke through together.
[“Damn, this is crazy.”]
[“I… I can’t go any further. I’m sorry.”]
As countless warriors succumbed to the dangers they faced, losing their will to fight, he pushed forward.
[“Behel—raaaaaaaaaa!!!”]
He took on the most dangerous missions, the most perilous assignments. He fought harder, more desperately than anyone.
Yet, Raven made her judgment.
[“That too… it’s just… because he had to do it to survive… .  That’s all it was… .”]
She stepped forward.
Thud. 
With each step that took her further from the cage, memories of their time together flooded back.  To be more precise,  the numerous acts of kindness, large and small, that he had shown her.
Each time, Raven thought to herself.
[“It wasn’t that hard of a task, really.”]
[“It wasn’t a matter of life and death.”]
[“…I helped him a lot, too, if he’s talking about helping.”]
For the most part, she could brush these thoughts aside.  But…
[“Could it be… that you came all this way for me? Through that inferno?”]
[“I was on a walk.”]
The day the Imperial Palace burned. 
[“What… what are you doing? You’re not trying to lift this entire ship, are you… ?”]
[“Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!!!”]
The time he sent his companions to safety on Parune Island, remaining behind to fight the enemy. 
And then, just a short time ago.
[“You… you… your back… !”]
He took the magic aimed at her, blocking it with his own body.
[“But… was he doing it for himself?”]
Raven soon realized what she had been trying so hard to deny.  She couldn’t deny it anymore.
[“There’s no way… it couldn’t be… .”]
Despite the urgency of the situation, she remembered it vividly.  The man, writhing in pain, his neck veins bulging,  carefully held her in his arms, protecting her from being crushed beneath him.
There was no point in deceiving herself any longer. She had tried to deny it countless times, but…
[“Raven, you were in danger. That’s why I saved you.”]
It was the truth, without a doubt.
***
Clank. 
The door beyond the passage, on the other side of the cage, slammed shut.
“He’s gone.”
“Yeah…  .”
It meant she had to give up on the hope that he might come back and open the cage for her.
“Evil Spirit.”
Huh?
She looked to her side and saw Erwin, her head hung low but her gaze fixed on her.
“...  Was he an Evil Spirit?”
Well, that’s why she was so quiet.
She must have been shocked.
After all, from Erwin’s perspective, it must have felt like she had kept the truth from her out of distrust.
“Erwin, calm down. Let me explain—”
“This woman knew, and I didn’t.”
“It’s just, well—”
“I told you, I could understand anything. But this…  !!  Why did you lie to me only? Don’t you trust me?  What do I have to do to earn your trust?!”
Wow, this is the first time I’ve seen her this pissed off… .
I looked to Amelia for help, but she just shrugged and avoided my gaze. Was this my karma? I had to deal with it myself?
[“At least… it seems like she doesn’t really care about the Evil Spirit thing…  .”]
Perhaps it was because she had just seen Raven walk away, unable to accept the truth about him being an Evil Spirit. 
Erwin’s rage filled me with a sense of unease, but at the same time, I felt a sense of relief and gratitude. 
Well, that was that, but this was this.
[“How do I calm her down… ?”]
My contemplation was short-lived.
“Raven, what is that woman?!  Why did you keep it from me so thoroughly?!  She’s dangerous!  Protecting her while revealing your true identity — !”
Thud. 
“...  ?”
Before Erwin could escalate further, I snatched her wrist.
And… 
“Erwin, I would have done the same thing if you had been in her place.”
I spoke with all my heart. 
Because, even if it had been Erwin, not Raven, I would have acted the same way. 
Was it difficult to believe so easily?
“That’s a lie… you didn’t even tell me beforehand…  You… you think that woman is more trustworthy than me.”
“What… ? Why are you thinking like that?”
“Because… I’m… like this… I eat those essences… I get treated like a crazy woman.”
Oh, I had no idea she felt this way. 
It seems she had been struggling with her own condition, filled with self-loathing… .
“Erwin, that’s not true.”
“Then… why did you hide it from me… ?”
Whew, I told her I’d explain, didn’t I?
I sighed inwardly and said, “Because I wanted to protect you.”
For some reason, the answer came from Amelia’s mouth.
“Reusing it is rational.”
What is she talking about, this one?
Ignoring her nonsense, I looked at Erwin, who reacted after a brief pause. 
“...  Huh?”
Her shoulders flinched and trembled.
“Me…  You… you mean me?”
Okay, her voice is calming down now… .
I hurried to explain, worried she might misinterpret something and jump to another conclusion.
“You saw it yourself. Raven asked Amelia a question.”
Even with Auruil Gaviss’s gift, I couldn’t prevent this kind of application.  I wanted to keep the number of people who knew about it as small as possible.  
Of course, it was also for my own sake, but it wasn’t a decision made solely for myself.
“If, one day, I were to be in a difficult situation because of my being an Evil Spirit, I wanted to create an escape route for you. If you didn’t know, you’d be a victim, but if you knew and helped, you’d be treated as an accomplice.”
“...  .”
“So… Rainwales, you care about me more than that woman?  You hid it from me on purpose.  To… protect me… .”
“Um… .”
I couldn’t help but glance at Amelia.
She chuckled and nodded, as if wondering why I was even asking.
She was saying, “Leave it to me. Just clean up the mess.” 
Whew, how reliable she is.
“Yes, that’s why I hid it from you.”
“...  Yes! I knew it!”
Erwin beamed, clenching her fists. 
Then, as if to show off, she shrugged and glanced in Amelia’s direction, a smile spreading across her lips.  It was a sign of gratitude toward Amelia.
“...  That’s a little infuriating.”
Amelia frowned, but Erwin ignored her and turned her attention back to me.
“Sir, I appreciate your concern, but… don’t do that again.  Leaving you behind and escaping myself? That’s not what I want!”
She said so, glancing at the cage from which Raven had left.
“After receiving so much help, unlike that woman, I know my gratitude.”
Huh?
“So… ?”
“So trust me! Okay?”
“Yes… .”
With that, Amelia, who had been observing, joined the conversation, changing the subject. 
“Speaking of, what do we do now?”
Ah, right… 
It was time to prepare. 
“First, we need to gather our things.”
“Things?”
“We can’t leave our equipment behind, can we?”
I went to the place where I had gathered the items I had looted from the lighthouse keeper and crouched down.  I gathered the equipment and wrapped them in a loose robe, like a bundle, tying them together and wrapping them tightly around my neck.  
It was my Barbarian packrat mode.  
Just in case, I planned to keep it with me for now and store it in the subspace when I got a chance.
“Once you’re done, tell me, what’s next? You must have a plan.”
Amelia asked again, and I shared Plan B, which I had silently worked out in my head. 
I remained on guard until the time was right.
How much time had passed?  
Clank.
The doorknob at the end of the hallway turned, and the door creaked open slowly.
And…  
Thud.
Raven, alone, appeared again.
“Alone.”
“What’s her game?  It’s already late enough for her to have reported to her superiors.”
Amelia and Erwin drew their weapons, wary, gazing at the cage.
Raven paused, startled, as she approached.
“Why are you alone?”
I asked, and Raven answered softly, “I wanted to confirm.”
We were about seven meters apart.  It felt like a much greater distance, perhaps because of the echo of her voice in the passageway.
But…
“Confirm what?”
Raven didn’t answer. 
She simply resumed her approach, narrowing the distance between them.
Thud, thud.
As Raven got closer to the cage, her expression, obscured by the shadows, became clearer. It was a complex expression that couldn’t be easily defined.  
One thing was certain, however.
“...  Could it be that she didn’t report it?”
I asked for confirmation, and Raven once again replied with silence.
Thud, thud. 
Her steps continued, unwavering.  It didn’t take long for the only thing separating them to be the cage.
“...  .”
“...  .”
Raven looked at me through her clear, blue eyes.  I didn’t speak, simply meeting her gaze.
How much time had passed?
Clank.
Raven silently pulled out a key from her pocket.
What had changed her mind?  Just moments ago, her heart had been closed off, and nothing I said could penetrate it. 
[“Could it be… a lure?”]
It was a plausible deduction. 
They would have received reports on our combat strength. 
If we became their enemies on the ship, it would be a difficult situation for them. Perhaps they would pretend to help us for now, but then arrest us in the city. 
Therefore… 
“...  What’s the sudden change?”
I asked directly. 
“What you’re about to do is, as you said earlier, betrayal of everyone who follows you.”
I watched Raven’s eyes as I spoke.  If she was a bad actress, I would be able to see through her lies, whether she was being truthful or not. 
But…
“Why are you laughing… ?”
It wasn’t a mocking laugh. It was more like a self-deprecating chuckle tinged with bitterness. 
What was the reason?
“It’s just… I feel like it’s similar to earlier.”
Huh?
“If I didn’t know Jandel was an Evil Spirit, I wouldn’t have even asked those questions.”
“Ah… .”
I was speechless for a moment.  
But Raven seemed to have already made up her mind and returned, her movements devoid of hesitation.
Click.
The key slid into the lock. The cage between me and Raven glimmered in the torchlight, reflecting our images like a mirror.
I felt a blush creeping up my cheeks.  I had given up, thinking it was all over and focusing only on Plan B. 
“...  My answer is the same.”
“It’s dangerous for Jandel to stay here.”
“So I’ve decided to help for now.  I’m not worried about the consequences.”
“So… .”
Clank, the key turned.
And…
“Come out quickly.  I need to hear what you’re planning next.”
The door that had been firmly shut creaked open.
