## Chapter 722: A Limited Time (1)
The question of "Who am I?"—a question so trite it had become tiresome.  Vercile Goulhand often found herself asking it lately.  After all, she was genuinely confused. 
"I am... ?"
Who?
In the early days of her arrival, the question was easily answered, a simple truth that needed no pondering.  But now, with over a decade spent bearing this name, the answer eluded her. 
"I am... ?"
Was she a white woman who worked in New York finance? Or was she a mage living in the Labyrinth City? 
"...I don't know."
To be honest, she didn't know.  So she resorted to a process of elimination. 
If she was the former, there were many inconsistencies.  After all, no matter how many 'NPCs' perished in Ice Rock, that woman from the financial world would never feel true rage.  
Even now, she could see it.  A self-absorbed, selfish woman would never be consumed with such fervent worry.  Not for the survival of 'us,' but for the survival of 'me.' 
"...What should I do?"
As if by habit, Goulhand's gaze drifted to a specific point.  The presence of the empty space, unchanged for days, was palpable.  He, who seemed capable of navigating any situation with clarity, was not here. 
But it was precisely because of that... 
"Snap out of it, Goulhand! We'll all die if you keep this up!"
She cleared her mind, a feat that wouldn't be impossible even for someone in a state of panic.
"If you can't handle it, I'll take over the—"
"Don't worry."
"...Huh?"
"I've regained my senses now."
Perhaps the situation wasn't as complex as it seemed.  During the war, the main force had retreated, abandoning the explorers at the front lines.  As a result, they were stranded in enemy territory.
"What about the deserters?"
"Sven Parav, Lilis Marone, Auyen Rocklobe, Emily Rains... four so far."
The well-being of her comrades who had fallen behind during the chaos gnawed at her, but honestly, she couldn't spare the energy to worry about them right now.
Therefore...
"I can only pray for their safety..."
Vercile Goulhand quickly regained her resolve.
"Aaaaaaaaaaagh...!!! P, please save me...!!!"
"The front lines are crumbling! We can't hold out much longer!"
"Reinforcements! Are there truly no reinforcements?"
"You fools! Do, don't run! Fight to the end!!"
The explorer clans, stationed at the front lines, were holding their ground by leaning on each other.  But it was clear that if things continued like this, they would eventually collapse.
Yes, that's why...
"Kaeslan, please summon the master of the clans currently resisting in this area. No, even if they're not the masters, any decision maker will do."
"What are you planning to do?"
"Just once... we'll all combine our strength and find a way out."
Of course, she knew it would come at the cost of countless lives.  But what could she do?
If they stayed here, they would all die.
"I see..."
Kaeslan, nodding in agreement, pointed out one key issue.
"But will they truly follow our lead?"
It was a concern she shared.  However, surprisingly, the answer was easily found.
The Barbarian would have surely acted this way.
"Tell them that our Anabada clan will take the lead. If they still refuse to join, then tell them we're leaving them behind."
Hearing that, Kaeslan paused as if a thought had crossed his mind. Then, he posed another question.
"So, the objective is to break through the siege and head towards the Imperial City?"
It was less a question and more of a final confirmation.  
Of course, the Imperial City housed the King.  It was naturally the safest place, even during a war.  However...
"No, we won't be heading towards the Imperial City."
Vercile shook her head firmly.
"We're going to the Holy Ground."
"...The Holy Ground?"
Kaeslan, while surprised, didn't oppose her.  On the contrary, he chuckled as if understanding her logic.
"I think I understand why Yandel made you his deputy commander."
"Is... that a compliment?"
"Indeed it is."
With those final words, Kaeslan dashed across the battlefield, relaying messages to each clan.  Vercile watched his back from afar, reaffirming her resolve one last time.
She couldn't believe this passionate side existed within her.  It felt strange, but...
"...We will."
We will survive and return. 
And we'll save as many as we can.

The screen filled the entire wall.  Exceptional sound equipment.  Such vivid imagery that merely watching it made her hands sweat. 
It would have been perfect, if only those in the video weren't my comrades. 
Beep-!
As Vercile and Kaeslan exchanged their awkward conversation, the King paused the video that was playing.  Then...
"Seems like they think highly of their subordinates, don't they?"
Subordinates...
I wanted to retort, but I swallowed my words.  The King chuckled at my silence.
"You seem to have a lot on your mind."
I couldn't deny it.
Why did he show me this video? 
Why did he pause it now?
And how did he even capture this video?
There were countless questions I wanted to ask.  But if I had to choose the most important one...
"This is..."
Yes, it had to be this. 
"...Now?"
Is this video live, or was it recorded a while ago?  In a way, it might be the most crucial aspect right now.
"A keen question. Excellent."
The King commended me in a satisfied voice.  But did his praise extend to this as well?
"However, it wouldn't be as fun if I told you already."
Damn hedonistic bastard.
While mentally chewing him out, he casually tossed a question my way.
"Which side do you think it is?"
Um...
"I guess I should rephrase that. Which side would you *like* it to be?"
I would prefer it to be live.
I answered honestly, and the King chuckled once more, throwing another question back at me.
"Ha! You can't change the past, can you?"
"...That's right."
After a brief pause, my reply drew a sudden burst of laughter from the King.
"Hahaha! Hwahahahaha!"
It was more than a mere chuckle, it was a roar of laughter.  It felt incredibly unpleasant to be subjected to that in front of him, but...
What could I do?
Clack...
As a complete subordinate, I had to endure it.
"...Haha, my apologies. It's been too long since I've laughed at something this funny."
Thankfully, his laughter didn't last long.  Soon, he stifled his laughter and stretched his neck, turning to me.
"So, what should we do...  You made me laugh genuinely for the first time in a while, so I can't just let it go. Ah, maybe I should just tell you the answer in return?"
Um...
'Really?'
As I unwittingly looked towards him through the silk, he casually revealed the 'answer.'
"The video you just saw was recorded."
"What's the time stamp?"
"Hmm... when was it?"
The King mumbled, and a knight standing before him politely replied.
"Your Majesty, it was when you were playing a 'board game' with Lord Yandel."
"Ah, was it?"
"... ."
While I was giggling with him, my comrades were fighting for their lives on the front lines.  That realization weighed heavily on me, while I quickly calculated the dates.
'The board game was on day two, and today is day four... .'
The video was recorded two days ago.  In other words, no matter who dies in this video, I can't intervene in any way.
"You seem disappointed and upset."
"... ."
"But I'll give you some comfort.  Even if this wasn't a recorded video, it wouldn't have made much difference."
"...What?"
"Because you wouldn't have changed anything anyway."
When I remained silent, the King tilted his head in confusion.
"Ah, maybe my words of comfort were a bit too blunt? Haha, it's because I'm a T."
My blood began to boil.
Everything about him was infuriating, from his audacity to casually mention personality types despite being an outsider, to everything in between.  
However, today wasn't the day to channel my inner Barbarian and attack him.  Again, I stayed silent, and he seemed bored as he restarted the video.
Beep-!
The figures in the video, who had been frozen in time, began moving frantically once more.  They were struggling to survive, shedding sweat and blood in the fight.
As I watched them, my heart pounded. 
No, actually, it had been doing that since before.
Thump!
Would a stray arrow, or a magic spell, hit my comrades in the video? Would the front lines suddenly collapse, plunging them into a worst-case scenario? Would someone get hurt or die while trying to break through?
And...
[Sven Parav, Lilis Marone, Auyen Rocklobe, Emily Rains... four so far.]
Were those four, reported as missing during the chaos, safe... ?
Clench-
The more I thought about it, the tighter my fists clenched.  
Because there was nothing I could do.
So I focused on what I *could* do. I thought and thought some more.
"Well, it's day four now...  Only three more days left, then."
Three days until the promised week is up.  But the remaining time is irrelevant.
Why did the King insist on keeping me company for a whole week, even after expending five of my 'requests'? 
Just to see me bound and tortured?
Tap, tap...
Perhaps, but...
Having experienced his personality firsthand, I was convinced that he wouldn't do that.  There must be another reason.
What could it be?
Tap, tap...
Thinking from the King's perspective, a plausible hypothesis popped into my mind.  Not a definite answer, but...
"You seem distracted. Ah, are you bored with this part?"
The King, manipulating the remote, paused the video once more.
"If you don't want to watch, just tell me. I don't mind chatting and playing games while we wait."
I slowly shook my head and asked him directly.
"Is anyone among my comrades dead... so far?"
"If you're curious, just keep watching."
"Answer me."
When I insisted, the King remained silent.  It was impossible to read his expression since I could only see his silhouette through the silk.
But it was unlikely he was pleased.  
And indeed, he didn't disappoint my expectations.
"You've... become quite the talker."
His voice, hinting at surprise but not displeasure.  It confirmed the hypothesis I had formed earlier.
"Is anyone dead?"
"...No. Not yet."
It's a form of training.  That's what this guy's doing to me.
"You're saying there's no one dead?"
"That's right."
The King seemed to relish my predicament. I nodded silently. 
Then, hunching over like a hunchback, I lifted my head to look up at him. 
Once again, I asked him directly.
"Your Majesty, how can I return to my comrades?"
A dramatic question, one I'd never attempted, even after becoming a Barbarian.
"... ."
"... ."
The King's reply came after a brief pause.
"Hmm, I thought you'd get there on day five."
I was confused.  Nothing had changed about his tone or the surroundings.
"This is... you're a smart one..."
Why did those words send chills down my spine?
Swish.
Without explanation, the silk curtain that hadn't been pulled back for four days, slid open to the side.  Then...
Thump.
The King stepped down the stairs, walking through the silk curtain.  He stretched his arms as if his shoulders were stiff, and moved towards the doorway.
"Ugh, this room is stifling. What are you doing?  Not coming?"
"Um..."
"Let's talk while we walk. I have something to show you."
"Ah, ah, yes... ."
I followed behind him, unsure of what to say, my mind completely blank.  It was inevitable.
'This... is the King?  '
He looked so much like...
Someone I knew.
