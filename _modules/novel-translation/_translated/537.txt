## Rainbow (4)
The City of Light, Calheim, one of the rifts on the 8th floor. And the rift guardian that appears in the final boss room of that city: Milaiel, the Heavenly Spear Bearer. I’m not sure why this monster appeared in a regular field, but let's gather information about it anyway. Its most distinctive feature is its use of Numbered items, despite being a monster.
“And… the drop rate of Verdant Spear is 3%.”
While Milaiel drops other Numbered items as well, “Verdant Spear,” a single Numbered item, has the highest drop rate. I remember farming it countless times when I was raising my Spear Barbarian. Verdant Spear is practically a graduation weapon for any Spear build. The essence itself was also great.
“Anyway, let's leave aside why this monster appeared here.”
As I mentioned earlier, if we manage to defeat it, the reward is guaranteed. A great essence if we're lucky, or a great weapon if we’re not.  The problem is our current condition.
“We can't win.”
I made a quick decision. While we could technically take down this monster with our current strength, the situation is too precarious.
“The cleric is practically out of commission now… and Erwen, our main damage dealer, is barely holding on.”
And that’s not all. While it’s fortunate we haven’t had any casualties yet, everyone is exhausted.
[Wuff! Grr! Wuff, wuff!]
[Rooooaaarrr!]
Monsters still swarm around us.  We need to prioritize survival, not rewards.
“Yandel, what do we do?”
Amelia asked, her voice grim. There wasn’t much to decide.
“We charge towards the coast from now on.”
“The coast…?  Ah, you mean we run away?”
“Yes, that’s exactly what we're doing.”
We have no other choice. However…
“We should at least get something out of this first.”
We need to make a decision before we run. We can’t leave a level 2 essence lying on the ground.
“Putting it in a vial is out of the question.”
I’m greedy, but it's too risky. It takes a while to put the essence into a vial, and something could happen in the meantime.  This means we need to put it into someone’s body before we run.
“Who should it be?”
I was torn, but I quickly made a decision.  Then…
Kaboom-!
I blocked Milaiel’s spear with my shield as it charged, and roared.
“Muell Armin!”
Muell Armin, the leader of Armin Expeditionary.  He’s the leader of his clan, and a unique explorer with the Necromancer class specializing in curses.  Honestly, it’s a little hard to stomach the idea of giving this precious essence to this outsider.
“Take the Siren’s essence.”
But he’s the best choice.  It seems like he leveled up recently, and he probably has an empty slot.
“…Excuse me?”
“Didn't you hear me? Hurry up! We don’t have time!”
“Ah, yes!”
He looked like he had not heard properly and was frozen, but he finally snapped out of it and rushed forward. Amelia protected him, ensuring his safe passage to the essence.
“Uh, are you sure about this? I’m not even your comrade…”
Oh, for the love of…
I’m already stressed out by this guy’s spear skills.
“It doesn’t matter, just hurry!”
“Yes! Yes sir!”
I pressed him, and Muell Armin absorbed the essence.  Okay, we’ve got everything we need…
I confirmed the essence absorption with a glance, then pushed Milaiel with all my strength, creating some distance between us.  I quickly gave my team new orders.
“Get into formation!”
“…”
“We’re charging towards the coast at full speed!”
“Yes…?”
Seriously, why are they so dense?
“Run!”
“Ah, yes! Everyone, get into the formation! We’re running at full speed now!”
Ugh, my Barbarian Baron is losing face.
***
“Huff, huff…”
We run, hot breath escaping our lungs.  This time, I'm at the very back, not at the front. The back is the most dangerous when someone’s chasing you.
[I will not let you escape, mortal.]
The monster, who always spoke in the game before combat, spoke in real life.  The problem is that it keeps repeating the same line like a parrot.
“Ugh, how many times has it said that now?”
I tried to talk to it a few times while running, but I never got a real answer.  I’m starting to wonder if it even has any intelligence.
“The monsters from the village chief had a feeling of real intelligence about them.”
Now that I think about it, the village chief’s village was unique.  Most of the monsters I encountered were like this though.
The Blood Castle’s Vampire Duke Cambormier. The Knight of Apocalypse from the White Temple. They all spoke, but there was no real communication to be had.
“Heavenly Spear Bearer, Milaiel has used [Reversal].”
Ugh, is it reading my mind.
Whiiiish-!
The moment I heard the threatening sound of tearing air behind me, I turned around and covered my upper body with my shield.
Kaboom-!
Ugh, that blasted spear.  Every time I block it, it feels like my shield is cracking in real time. It’s a single Numbered weapon, but it has skills that can be used in combat, so it’s a real pain.  
“Well, at least it only uses one skill.”
As a side note, this phenomenon occurs because Milaiel is a “Guardian.”  Rift Guardians have very specific patterns. Like lowering their HP or activating nearby devices. They repeat their actions in a predetermined framework unless certain thresholds are crossed.
“If it were a regular ‘Titanus,’ we wouldn’t even be able to run.”
That doesn’t mean it’s an easy opponent. The skill it uses in the first phase isn’t something we can just ignore. 
“Heavenly Spear Bearer, Milaiel has used [Reversal].”
[Reversal].
It’s a simple skill, a throwing skill with an unavoidable judgment and increased damage.  But there’s one nasty feature attached to it.
“Heavenly Spear Bearer, Milaiel has recovered Verdant Spear.”
Once it’s thrown, the weapon returns to the user’s hands after a certain time, no matter how far it goes.  And…
“The power of [Reversal] increases slightly until the battle ends.”
A kind of stacking skill? The more times it uses the pattern, the more powerful it becomes.  And thanks to that…
Kaboom-!
The holes in my shield, which had blocked even the village chief’s sword, are growing in size.  Ugh, this is hard to repair.
I sighed as I looked at my battered shield, but I quickly checked the situation ahead.  Although I'm at the back of the formation, I can see the front easily thanks to [Enlarge], which allows me to look down from above. 
“It's going surprisingly well.”
I didn’t expect our formation to crumble just because I left the front, or for our progress to be significantly hindered.  In fact, this is what I was hoping for. But why do I feel a pang of emptiness?
“Whatever… I’ll just do my job.”
It’s a warrior’s duty to do their job quietly, whether or not anyone acknowledges it.
How much time passed as I stayed behind the main formation, dedicated to blocking Milaiel’s spears?
“There's the sea!”
A cliff appeared between the dense trees, and as we jumped down, the coast we saw when we first arrived at the island appeared.
“Heavenly Spear Bearer, Milaiel has used [Reversal].”
Seriously, doesn’t it ever get tired?
The spear that passed through my shield vanished into a flash of light, only to return instantly. 
Wuff-!
This time, the pain is in my shoulder. I’m sure I blocked it with my shield…
“Ah.”
The spear pierced through the holes in the shield.  
“B, Biora!”
“Yandel! Are you alright?”
Misha and Amelia were at the front, and they rushed towards me, startled.  Bersil also quickly brought out a potion, taking the cleric’s place because her divine power was exhausted.
But I refused their concern.
“Later.  We need to launch the ship first.”
“Ah…”
There was still some time before the spear returned to Milaiel, so I quickly pushed through the crowd and ran towards the coast.
“Uh…”
“Uh-huh…”
“Is, is that alright?”
The explorers, busy opening a path, were startled to see me running with such a large spear stuck in my shoulder.  I mean, a giant Barbarian with a spear that large stuck in his shoulder. It’s understandable they’d be shocked.
Whoosh-!
I summoned the ship and boarded it, taking the explorers onto the deck with my own hands in my [Enlarge] state.  After everyone was on board, I returned to my normal size, boarded the ship, poured in all my magic stones into the magitech propulsion system, and took off.
Just as we were leaving the island and were about to breathe a sigh of relief…
“Heavenly Spear Bearer, Milaiel has used [Reversal].”
The spear flew towards me once more, impaling my abdomen.  
“Hey, Yandel…!”
“My Lord!!”
Ugh, dammit…
I winced and bent over in pain, but I looked up to see the monster standing on the coast.  I remember its face clearly…
“I’ll see you again.”
A Barbarian never forgets their enemy.
***
Whoosh-!
The ship cut through the silver waves.  The deck was packed with so many people, it’s a squeeze, but no one complains.  At least we can sit down and rest. Everyone is taking a break, enjoying the present situation.  Well, there were a few explorers whose faces were overshadowed by a dark cloud.
“One casualty…”
One of the Hectz Clan warriors died while escaping the island.  Ugh, why does it always have to be a warrior when it comes to casualties.  As a fellow warrior, I can’t help but feel a pang of sadness whenever I hear such news.
“It’s a miracle, really…  That only one person died.”
“Yes, that’s true.  What was that warrior’s name?”
“Shelian느 에머타운.”
The moment I heard the name, a face came to mind.  We didn’t talk much off-duty, but she was a rare female warrior in the industry.  She always had a bright and cheerful smile.
“What about the body?”
“We managed to retrieve it.”
“That’s good…”
We finished talking about her, and I called the explorers together and told them we should hold a funeral for the deceased explorer.  Everyone was tired and exhausted, but there was no opposition to my suggestion.
Whoosh-!
A simple funeral, of course.  It was inside the maze, on a ship, so it wasn’t fancy.  We laid out a cloth that wouldn’t burn and placed the body on it.  We burned the body and then placed the ashes in an urn.  
Woosh-! Crack-! Crack-!
Monsters continued to fall from the sky, even during the funeral.  Well, at least they were stopped by the barrier we put up on the ship and fell into the sea.
Drip, drip.
Like rain on a windowpane, the blood on the barrier collected and dripped down in droplets.
“Rest in peace.”
“Ha-ha. Don’t be too upset. We’re all in the same boat. Any one of us could be next.”
“Ugh, don’t jinx it, alright?”
It’s understandable that explorers nearing death would crack jokes, even in such a solemn atmosphere.  But no one censured them for it. Everyone knows that everyone copes in their own way.
“That’s it.  Rest.  And everyone, good job.”
After the funeral, everyone was free to rest again.  The mages couldn’t completely relax because they had to keep the barrier up, but it was a lot better than maintaining it on the island.  Thanks to the magitech propulsion system, we’d disassembled and modified it as soon as the ship was on the sea, connecting it to a magical circuit.  
“We have enough magic stones, and the number of monsters falling is lower than expected. If nothing major happens, we should be able to hold out until the rainy season is over…”
Can we finally relax now?
Even as I leaned against the wall and thought that, my mind was still churning.  So I just rummaged through my subspace and pulled out a temporary shield.  It was obviously a lower quality, level 3 shield compared to the one I was using before. Back then, I didn’t have much spare cash, and even while preparing for this, I wondered if I’d ever actually need it.
“I guess that day really came.”
I smiled wryly, and someone came up to me from the side.
“My Lord.”
Muell, leader of the Armin Expeditionary.
“What is it?  Don’t you have a break?”
“I apologize for interrupting your rest. However… I have a question I wanted to ask.”
Even after I gave him permission, Muell hesitated for a moment before speaking.
“Why?”
“What do you mean?”
“That… Siren’s essence.  Why did you give it to me?”
Ah, so that’s what he wanted to know.  Well, the answer is simple.
Firstly, Ainar, Amelia, Erwen, and Misha were never even considered.  They each have their designated essences.  And Bersil is a mage, so he can’t absorb essences.
“Auyen is the only one who might be a candidate…”
But even for her, the essence isn’t ideal.  She can use [Mimicry] to copy the skills of monsters, and contribute to combat depending on the situation.  But that’s about it. It would be like throwing away the essence’s core passive skill.
That’s why I ultimately chose Muell.
“You were the one who could make the best use of it.”
“Is… that all?”
The truth is, it’s not all.  The Armin Expeditionary is entitled to a share of the expedition’s loot, right?  I’m pre-paying them with a level 2 essence so they won’t make any demands when we collect the rest.  But…
“I don’t want to sound so blunt.”
So I shrugged.
“Yes, that’s all.”
“But! We’re still just…”
“How are you still ‘just’? You’re already our comrade.”
“Com… rade…?”
“Yes, is there a problem?”
Muell Armin remained silent for a moment at my nonchalant response, and the silence continued.
“My Lord…”
Muell, his voice slightly choked, shook his head.
“No. I’ll be going now. Rest easy.”
I don’t know for sure, but it seemed like he made a big decision.
***
Six days after the rainy season began.  Our journey after escaping the island was peaceful.  We fended off monsters that kept crawling onto the deck, and monsters continued to fall from the sky.  But it was nothing compared to the chaos we experienced while escaping that island.
Anyway, since things had calmed down, I had time to reflect and review my plans.
“Okay, I’ve made a decision.”
I pulled out a pendant I’d carefully kept in my subspace, and Misha’s eyes lit up.
“Uh, Biora?  That…”
“…”
“Is… is that for me…?”
What is she talking about?  She needs to pick the right thing to covet.
I read the greed in her eyes and quickly put the pendant back into my subspace.
No. 7777 Garpas’ Necklace.
It’s time to try this out.
