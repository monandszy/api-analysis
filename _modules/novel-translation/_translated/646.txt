## Coming Out (4)
Button-like eyes. 
Skin as smooth and white as silk.
Lips that seemed to be meticulously crafted with crimson silk thread. 
“…….”
“…….”
Not even the most exquisite lifelike doll, crafted with a craftsman's sweat and time, could compare. 
This was a cheap stuffed toy, the kind that ordinary children might play with when they were young, with a ribbon on its forehead, the only indication of its 'female' gender.
"So… does Baron Yandel… feel romantic feelings for the doll?"
The moment Ragna cautiously posed the question, shame washed over me, a rush of blood to my head.
It felt like my hair was falling out in real time.
‘…I want to die.’
This was strange. 
Even in the Goblin Forest or Ice Rock, I had never thought that way, regardless of the hardships.
"Th… that’s right."
As I forced a nod of agreement, another nobleman, as if bursting with amazement, muttered to himself.
"I knew it! All those women around him, and he never seemed interested in any of them…"
He seemed to genuinely believe my refusal to marry was because of this doll.
Well… thankfully(?) there were only a few people like that. 
"Quiet down."
A nobleman beside the one who had naively spoken those words reprimanded him, as if reminding him to be mindful of the situation.
This is why I didn't bring a high-quality doll.
If I had brought something truly crafted by a master, there would have been even more noblemen like that.
Ah, of course, the most important thing right now was the Marquess's reaction.
“…….”
Holding the small doll tightly in one hand, I met the Marquess's gaze.
Initially, like the other nobles, the Marquess seemed dazed, but he soon regained his composure.
“He loves a doll… ”
The Marquess, looking back and forth between the doll and me, muttered thoughtfully.
"That's… so you."
He didn't mean that loving a doll was 'so me'. He simply meant that the way I resolved the situation was 'so me'. 
‘…What will he do now.’
Whether the Marquess believes me or not isn't important.
No, I never expected him to believe me in the first place.
Just like the Duke of Kearlunas and the Marquess of Terselion had spoken earlier, as if reading from a script.
Every statement is a political calculation.
And my earlier statement was no different.
I expressed my intention to not marry anyone, using this method as a roundabout way to convey it.
“Hmm…”
The question is whether my efforts resonated with the Marquess.
Waiting patiently for his response in the silence, the Marquess, seemingly having finished his deliberation, answered.
"Your confession of loving a doll was quite shocking and unsettling for me. However, I believe love takes different forms for different people."
"…So?"
"I respect your choice."
At first glance, this was a very positive response, but as expected, his words were quickly followed by a barbed remark.
"You're not someone who would spout nonsense in front of a gathering of the country's brightest minds. I trust you understand the responsibility that comes with your words."
In simple terms, he was implying that if I break my promise now, I would face consequences.
"Nevertheless, you’ve shown your sincerity, so it is only right for me, as a person of authority, to support your choice."
However, the Marquess, sensing that he was pushing me into a corner, offered a compromise.
"But as the King's Minister, I must ask you to have children someday. For your family's lineage and for the sake of our nation, it would be a significant loss if a talented individual like you leaves this world without passing on your bloodline."
Someday, when the time is right.
"I see you have quite a few impressive warrior women around."
He was willing to allow me to marry and have children with my own kind.
I responded to the Marquess's proposal.
“…I'll consider it.”
Though I said that, it was basically a yes.
After all, it would be ridiculous to suddenly say yes at this point?
"Now, let’s conclude this matter. Everyone, I appreciate your patience. Let's continue with the ninth agenda item."
It seems like I’ve gotten through this one for now.
***
To be honest, I had no plans to make a declaration of singlehood like this.
My decision to not marry anyone, however, was not driven by fear of a conflict with the Marquess.
You could say it was a dual purpose?
I made my decision the moment I finished talking to the Dragon Uncle.
‘What marriage for me… ‘
This may be a decision like betrayal, going against the standing I’ve built in this city and the people who follow me.
But so what?
Some might say I’m still holding onto the ways of a modern person, something that I haven't fully shed yet.
But for me, marriage is a sacred thing.
I can't make a lifelong commitment to someone I don’t even fully know, and having children is even more out of the question.
‘Especially when I don’t even know when I might die.’
Ah, of course, this decision wasn’t based solely on my emotional reasoning.
My priority is survival.
While marriage might be advantageous in this process, after careful consideration, I ultimately decided:
‘The benefits are as many as the drawbacks.’
Marrying someone for political gain might seem good on the surface, but ultimately, it creates just as many enemies.
The fact that I can receive support means that I will also be obligated to help others.
“We'll conclude this meeting with this agenda item. I thank you all for taking the time to attend.”
Lost in thought, I barely noticed that the ninth agenda item was quickly finished, and the Royal Meeting concluded.
And then… 
‘Why is it in reverse order again?’
Instead of everyone leaving together, they started exiting the hall one by one, in order of proximity to the seat of honor, with a two-minute interval between each person.
‘…They really discriminate over the most trivial things.’
Strangely enough, being subjected to this discrimination made me want to climb the ranks in this Royal Meeting, something I hadn’t been interested in before.
Well, in that sense, maybe it’s a well-designed tradition?
Even I felt the desire to climb the ranks, so what about those power-hungry monsters?
Thud.
The hall was completely empty, everyone gone.
Feeling a strange sense of sorrow, I rose from my seat and left the hall.
I was about to leave the palace to return home.
“…Just a moment.”
Someone called out to me from behind.
“Rag….”
Well, someone might see, so it's better to keep some distance. 
"Still here? Countess Peprock."
"No one’s around, so you can call me by my name like usual."
"Even so, it's better to be careful, Countess."
" ……."
Yeah, I'm still calling Amelia ‘Emily’ even now, just in case I make a slip up, any time, anywhere.
"So, you’ve been waiting for me?"
"Yes, I have something I need to tell you."
"What is it?"
"That… doll."
Ragna mentioned the doll with a look of displeasure, then continued.
"Ah, of course, I don’t believe what you said earlier. I almost misunderstood at first, but… I heard from my father… no, the Marquess of Terselion. I’m still lacking in many ways when it comes to politics, so…"
"Anyway, what were you going to say?"
"Th… that..."
Ragna hesitated for a long time, trailing off. Then, with her eyes shut tight, like I had when I came out, she spoke.
"Baron, do you… dislike me?"
"What…?"
"I’m asking if you dislike me so much that you would endure such a humiliating experience to reject me."
Uh...
I’m a little taken aback by this sudden question.
But if I’m honest,
"You seem to have misunderstood. I don’t dislike you or anything."
Of course, if you’re asking if we’re right for each other, I can confidently say no.
But…
"The main reason I refused the Marquess’s proposal was because of political issues."
“Poli… tics?"
“Yes. If we were to marry, would other nobles just sit idly by?"
The Marquess’s faction is the one that's rising rapidly in Rafdonia's political scene.
And if I were to join them?
The Duke of Kearlunas's forces, the noble alliance led by the Kaislan family, and even the Alminas Earldom, which claims to be neutral, wouldn’t just stand by and watch.
They would try to protect themselves, forming alliances and the like.
"We can prevent that…."
“Well, maybe. But I don’t want to get caught up in those kinds of interests. I don’t want to have to worry about those kinds of power dynamics.”
"Is that so…."
"You understand, don’t you?"
“Yes. I understand. You meant that you had to refuse because of my current standing."
Uh... is that how you interpret it?
It feels a little off, but I can’t exactly call it a wrong interpretation either…
"Well, I’ll take my leave now. Bjorn Yandel, you must be tired. Have a good rest.”
"Yeah, it was nice meeting you. Let’s catch up some other time.”
"Yes."
We exchanged short farewells and parted ways.
I left the palace and was heading toward the carriage station. 
“…Huh?”
There was a sudden presence. I checked the alleyway, and there was someone standing silently in the shadows.
About 170 cm tall.
Slim build. 
However, they were wearing gloves on their hands and a thick robe pulled over their head, covering them completely.
For a moment, I thought someone had sent an assassin, but when I thought about it, it made no sense.
This is Rafdonia.
And who in their right mind would send just one assassin to take me out?
‘What are they doing at this time of night.’
They look incredibly suspicious, but I decided it wasn’t my problem and tried to continue walking.
Click.
The mysterious stranger took a step toward me, moving closer to the streetlamp that was illuminating the road. 
And at the same time.
Swish.
They pulled back the robe that was covering their face, forcing me to stop walking.
A black mask, nothing particularly special.
But the shape, the curves, and the atmosphere radiating from the person perfectly matched something in my mind.
‘…Black Mask.’
But right now, I’m Bjorn Yandel, not the community’s Investigator or Lee Hansoo, so I narrowed my eyes, maintaining my poker face.
"Who are you? An assassin?"
The most natural reaction I could come up with in that instant.
But the mysterious masked figure shook their head.
And then…
"I couldn't be."
Along with a ‘female’ voice that sounded vaguely familiar.
Swish.
The mask fell away, revealing the stranger's face.
Black hair and black eyes. 
And facial features and skin that leaned towards Asian.
"Harin Suevi."
No, to be more precise, it was an evil spirit that had possessed Harin Suevi’s body.
Kang Hyeonbyeol, a Korean.
She smiled at me silently.
Feeling a chill down my spine, I tried not to show it, and asked.
"Why are you here? Did Ragna send you?"
“No?”
"Then why…."
“I told you last time, I’m going to do what I want to do from now on. So, let’s meet outside.”
Of course, I know that Hyeonbyeol sent that note last time. 
But it's become a habit, so I said, 
“What exactly do you—”
—mean by that. 
As I was about to ask, 
"Ah, at the time, I didn’t know I’d have to wait this long."
Hyeonbyeol interrupted me, and then, as if stifled, she removed the thick robe that was covering her body.
And then…
"But I’ve seen you, so that’s all that matters."
She took another step toward me, using her long legs.
‘I thought she seemed taller than she used to be.’
Click.
"Bjorn Yandel."
Click.
"No, Hansoo oppa."
How the hell did she figure it out?
