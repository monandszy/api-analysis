## Chapter 469: Us and Them (1)
*Ding!*
As soon as I turned on my computer, a cheerful notification sound greeted me.
"A message...?”
I hurriedly checked the message box, where an unread message appeared at the top.
The send time was just a few seconds ago.
It meant that the message was sent to me as soon as the community opened...
Click, click.
I opened the message and checked.
[Sender: Ghost master.]
[I would like to have a brief conversation.]
A short, single-line request.
Below it were only the name and password of a secret chat room.
“Hmm…”
What should I do?
If I answer this invitation now, Baekho will be waiting for me.
I hesitated for a moment, but it didn't take long to make a decision.
‘…I'll finish it quickly. I'm also curious why he called me.’
Maybe I could find a clue to help me deal with Baekho in a conversation with the GM.
Yeah, what's wrong with being a bit late?
Will Baekho just leave because of that?
“It's been a while, Lion.”
As soon as I entered the chat room, a white man with the nickname 'Elfnunalove' stood up and greeted me.
I ignored his greeting and sat down on the sofa.
“So, what's up this time?”
“I released Ben as you requested, Lion. Did you get along well with Baekho?”
Oh, trying to get some credit for it.
“Is that all you called me for?”
“No, of course not.”
The GM sat down on the sofa, following me, and continued.
“You see, I heard a funny story at the round table the other day. ‘Elfnuna’ has already entered this world, haven't they?”
That was it.
I felt a surge of pride knowing the bait I had laid out worked, but I kept a straight face.
“So?”
“I'll ask directly. Are you ‘Elfnuna’?”
Even as a Barbarian who loves getting straight to the point, it was a bit of a surprising question.
I didn’t expect him to ask like this.
“Well, why should I answer you?”
I answered nonchalantly, and the GM replied instantly.
“I’m the one who released Baekho's ban. Do you think I would have done that just for my own safety?”
He was sweating profusely at the time, and I can still see it clearly.
However, it wouldn't be entirely made up.
“Lion, you have something you need from me, and I have something I need from you.”
Give and take.
The GM also had something he wanted from me, which is why he gave me the card of Baekho's ban.
As the saying goes, keep your enemies closer than your friends.
The GM must have been reluctant to give up the information I provide at the round table. He probably wanted to observe after granting my request.
‘But he immediately called me the moment ‘Elfnuna’ was mentioned…’
My curiosity grew even stronger.
“If you want to maintain our current relationship, answer me. Are you ‘Elfnuna’?”
Why is the GM so obsessed with ‘Elfnuna’?
I mentioned that nickname at the round table because I wanted to solve this very question.
Therefore…
“Before I answer, let me ask you a question.”
I countered.
Of course, if I asked directly, it would seem like I didn’t know anything. So, like a detective, I tried to be as indirect as possible.
“Do you believe what that old man said?”
It was a test.
I had once had a conversation with the GM from a past era during my newbie days.
[I'm not sure, but I think I know who the person you were talking about at the end is.]
[He was very famous even in the Stone Iven community... He was someone I admired very much.]
At the time, the GM mistook me for Aviral Gavis.
Therefore, I assumed the GM's obsession with Elfnuna might stem from his belief in Aviral Gavis' words.
However…
“There is no reason not to believe him. At least, the story on the Chronicle Stone is true.”
A very strange answer came back.
‘Chronicle Stone…?’
It was a word I had never heard before.
***
What is a Chronicle Stone?
‘Is it like the fragment stone of the past that sent me back, or a relic of a Great Sage?’
I didn't know, but I got a strong feeling that it was crucial information.
Maybe a key that could solve all the mysteries I have.
However, I kept quiet and listened to the conversation without showing my thoughts.
“There's no one other than him. If not him, who else could have cleared the original difficulty?”
Not knowing about the Chronicle Stone, the GM's story sounded incomplete.
However, at least I could understand one thing.
“No matter what anyone says, it's impossible without him.”
The GM's faith is like that of a fanatic.
My aunt's eyes were exactly like that when she was into a cult.
“…”
As the person who the faith is directed toward, I felt a physiological awkwardness first.
It was time to make a decision.
“Now, tell me. Lion, are you really ‘Elfnuna’?”
The question repeated for the third time already.
It was a bit of a dilemma.
If that blind faith and affection aren't an act, I can at least use him. Maybe I could make him my ally.
“I am not that person.”
However, that was my final decision.
The information about the Chronicle Stone, the various foundations the GM has built over the years, it would be a lie to say I wasn’t interested. But…
‘Yes, this is right.’
I decided it was right to answer that question after I investigated what ‘Chronicle Stone’ actually was. Most irreversible mistakes are caused by ignorance.
[You shouldn't open the gate of the abyss.]
…That's what the witch said. That keeps bothering me.
“…Is that so.”
Thankfully, the GM accepted it easily.
Since he directly asked if I was him, I thought there was some basis.
But it seems like he was just testing the waters.
“Then tell me about ‘Elfnuna’. Where is he now? What species—.”
As he started pouring out his questions, I cut him off.
“That's rude.”
“…Excuse me?”
“I answered your first question honestly because it was a favor for you keeping your promise to me.”
In other words, that's as far as the compensation for releasing Baekho's ban goes.
“…”
The GM looked stunned, and I felt a little guilty, but there was nothing I could do.
It would be weird to pretend I don't know anything here, right?
Well, it's best to just use the concept in these situations.
“If you want my favor, you should show your favor as well.”
“…You’re asking for something in return.”
The rule of the Lion, a rule that has continued since the round table.
“But… isn't that unfair?”
As expected, the GM voiced his complaint.
So what?
“I risked my neck to release Baekho's ban. But one question—.”
“I was wrong about you.”
“…”
“Do you really think that just releasing Baekho's ban with a few seconds of effort is equal to information about ‘him’?”
“That’s… .”
The GM froze, and that was the end of the conversation.
“If you understand, then I’m off.”
With those words, I quickly left the chat room.
***
I had just finished my dirty deed and returned to my room.
“Whew…”
After taking a deep breath, I clicked the mouse to check the chat room.
[Daehan Dokrip Manse] - 2 members are online.
Two members…
One would be Baekho, and the other Hyunbyeol.
Thankfully, they didn’t leave just because I didn’t come back immediately.
‘Let me organize my thoughts for a bit.’
I leaned back in my chair, replaying the conversation I had with the GM just now.
[There is no reason not to believe him. At least, the story on the Chronicle Stone is true.]
I’m not sure yet, but maybe Baekho's concern for Elfnuna is also related to that Chronicle Stone.
‘…I'll have to probe Baekho about it as well.’
Good, I'm glad I checked in with the GM first.
After organizing my thoughts, I clicked the mouse to enter the chat room.
“…But I told you it’s not possible! Hans will kill me if he finds out!”
“We are the only ones who know, so how would Hans even—.”
Two people sitting on the sofa in front of the fireplace, having a suspicious conversation. Curious, I watched them for a moment, but unfortunately, they noticed me.
“Hiek!”
Baekho was startled as if he had seen a ghost.
“…”
Hyunbyeol next to him also flinched, then looked at me with that unique expression she always makes when she does something wrong.
“What are you doing?”
Baekho jumped up and ran toward me, hastily explaining himself.
“Hyung! It’s not my fault! Hyunbyeol asked me about your identity, but I told her it’s not possible!”
I had a feeling about this.
I looked at Hyunbyeol with a questioning gaze, and she avoided my eyes, staring at Baekho.
“…I guess Baekho is an untouchable man?”
A voice devoid of emotion, just stating facts.
“Haha, Nuneem! It’s not like that—.”
“Why would I be Baekho's Nuneem?”
“Yes? You told me to call you that—.”
“Is Baekho acting the same as before?”
“…”
Baekho awkwardly laughed at Hyunbyeol's cutting remarks, which came out with a sharp voice, and looked at me as if asking for help.
‘…Well, I did keep it a secret from Hyunbyeol.’
I was about to step in and clear the situation.
‘But wait a minute.’
An unexpected thought crossed my mind.
Why should I defend this guy?
The guy who just ran away saying ‘*poing*’ when things got tough because they were fighting to the death?
‘Whew, I almost let it go.’
Recalling the emptiness, anger, and humiliation I felt that day, I recomposed myself.
“Hyunbyeol.”
A low voice, as cold as the emotions sinking in my heart.
Hyunbyeol flinched and replied.
“………Why?”
“Just leave for a bit. I have something to talk to him about. We’ll continue what we were doing later.”
“Okay… .”
Hyunbyeol left the chat room without a word, probably because she was guilty.
And…
“…”
“…”
An awkward silence filled the chat room.
While I stared at him, Baekho opened his mouth first.
“H-hyu-ung… Are you still really mad?”
I couldn’t care less.
Mad? Is this the place for such a question?
“Never mind that, just tell me the conclusion.”
“…”
“You said your brain wasn't working back then, so you'd answer later?”
“Aha, haha… Nyaong-i… I mean, Misha… .”
Baekho scratched his neck with an embarrassed expression.
But seeing him act like this didn’t make me laugh. Instead, it only increased my wariness.
I know him, you see.
How cunning this guy is despite seeming impulsive and frivolous.
This behavior he's showing now is all intentional.
“Well, I’ve given it some thought, and—.”
“…”
“Surprise! In the end, I, Baekho, decided to give it back! Wow! Clap, clap, clap! Good news, good news!”
Is this guy actually crazy?
“…”
I just stared at him, knowing I’d get swept up if I accepted, but Baekho didn’t care and continued in his usual high-pitched tone.
“How about it, Hyung? Can you tell I'm being sincere now? It was just a joke back then! A joke, a joke! Just kidding!”
“…”
“Oh, come on! You’re still angry? Just let it go. Okay? You need to see the bigger picture! The bigger picture!”
“Whew…”
I finally let out a sigh I had been holding back.
“Oh! You sighed! That's it! You’re not angry anymore, right? Yes? Right?”
“Why does sighing mean I’m not angry?”
“Ah, you’re just being difficult again.”
“… .”
Thinking about it, I’ve always been weak to this type.
If I could punch him in the face, that’d be another story, but I can’t do that here.
“Stop with the nonsense. So, when are you giving it back?”
“Whenever. Shall I send it tomorrow?”
“Yeah, send it right away. Don’t mention what happened between us. Can you do that?”
“Yep. I’ll go find you right away when I hear you’re back, right?”
“You… Can’t you change that tone?”
“Yep? Why?”
“…”
“He-he, okay, I won’t. Don’t get mad, Hyung.”
“Whew…”
I tried my best not to get caught up in his energy, but it wasn't easy.
If the situation had gone worse, I don't know. But Baekho did step back and concede, didn’t he?
‘I’d be in trouble if he had stubbornly refused to give it back.’
“So, we're done with Misha? Can we move on to the next topic now?”
“Next topic?”
“Yeah! You said you’d grant my request if I sent Misha back, right?”
“I said I would consider it.”
“It’s the same thing. What do you have to lose, Hyung?”
“That's up to me to decide. So, tell me, what exactly can you do for me if you help me break through the 10th floor?”
“A lot. I've already done some things for you.”
“…”
I gestured for him to hurry up and stop dragging his feet, and Baekho opened his mouth with a smug look.
“Tercesion Duke.”
“The Duke?”
“Yeah. That bastard can’t touch you anymore.”
…What the heck does he mean?
