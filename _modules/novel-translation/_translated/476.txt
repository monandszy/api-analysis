##  Chapter 476: Man and Woman (3)
The Baron of Lapdonia.
A hero to explorers.
The newly appointed deputy chieftain of the barbarians.
The leader of Clan Anabada.
All these titles belonged to one man: the giant, Bjorn Yandel.
"He… he was really alive all this time…."
Misha Kalstain clenched her fists. After going out to the city at dawn and searching tirelessly, she confirmed what Baekho had said was true.
"Then what have I been doing all these years…."
She was swept away by a wave of indescribable emotions. She was happy, yet sad. Empty, yet filled with overwhelming joy.
Of course, she was also angry. 
Why did Bjorn Yandel have to pretend to be dead, deceiving me? 
If he hadn't, I wouldn't have spent these years with those criminals…
"No."
She shook her head, dismissing the intrusive thoughts. He must have had a reason. Bjorn Yandel was that kind of person.  Until she heard his explanation directly, she wouldn't harbor any doubts.
"Yes, that's right. That's what I should do…."
Muttering these words to herself, she headed towards Bjorn's residence, which she had discovered through her investigation that day. But the house was empty.
"He… he moved?"
Why now of all times…
She decided to stay in a nearby inn for the night. The next morning, she continued her search and finally found Bjorn's new home.
"Kommelbi…"
It felt strange. They had promised to move to a place like this, a bustling city center, once they earned enough money.
'This is Bjorn's house…'
She had finally reached her destination, but hesitated to knock on the front door. Countless thoughts swirled in her mind.
How will Bjorn react when he sees me?
What if he doesn't welcome me?
I heard he's living with that fairy and Emily Rains now.
'Emily Rains… that's probably the woman I met on Parune Island.'
What kind of relationship do they have?
How did they become companions?
The rumors of a secret relationship… they must be false, right?
Unbidden anxiety surged within her.
Perhaps that was why…
"…"
Misha Kalstain spent the entire day wandering around the house, occasionally peering inside before finally returning home.
'At least I got to see him briefly…'
She hadn't dared to approach Bjorn, who returned home late at night. He looked exhausted.
'Yes, that's it. That's the only reason…'
I'll come back tomorrow and meet him then.
With that thought, she turned to leave, but the next day, the same thing happened. Bjorn left early in the morning and came home late at night. She could have spoken to him at any time, but her feet wouldn't move.
"Heehee. Have a good day, sir!"
"...I wish we could eat dinner together tonight."
Two women, their eyes heavy with sleep, saw him off at the door every morning. Bjorn, in turn, scolded them for coming all the way out to see him off.
Now she understood.
'Bjorn… he's alright.'
Even without me.
Bjorn's life hadn't changed much from before.
Day by day, she continued to linger around his house, sometimes using her abilities to hide her presence and secretly observe their lives. Both women were sensitive to presences, and she had almost been discovered several times, but she managed to avoid being caught because she didn't enter the house.
But she gradually became bolder.
From watching from afar, she moved closer to the window.
Then, from eavesdropping under the window, she moved to the wall of the empty lot behind the house.
One day, while hiding and observing their daily routine…
Swoosh-!
A magic circle appeared as Bjorn returned home. 
She questioned the two women about the changes made to the empty lot while Bjorn was gone.
"This…? It's like this now. It might look a bit ugly, but… there's no other way, right?"
"We can't let one person have it all, so we're just splitting it."
Are they really talking about the empty lot?
The thought crossed her mind, but Misha didn't dwell on it.
After that, they moved to the kitchen for their meal. The one who had prepared the meal was still the mysterious man whose identity remained unknown.
"How is it? Do you find it to your liking?"
"Just right. The seasoning is perfect. And there's plenty of meat."
He always said it was too bland for me.
"The ladies instructed me to always prepare plenty, as we don't know when the chieftain will be back."
Misha, who was hiding, felt her body freeze like stone.
'…The ladies?'
Were those rumors true?
She didn't know, but Bjorn neither refuted nor acknowledged the term.
Thump-
Her heart felt like it was sinking. She, too, had been misconstrued a few times while living with Bjorn, but he had always denied those assumptions.
"Sir, you don't have any other schedule today, do you?"
After finishing their meal, they went out to the garden and enjoyed snacks while chatting. The empty lot, divided into a training ground and a garden according to their preferences. A round table and three chairs situated on one side.
'…They're too close.'
Worried that she might be discovered if she stayed there, she slowly moved towards the wall, making sure to remain undetected.
Silently, she took a step.
Two steps.
As she moved further away from the two laughing women, one thought kept circling in her mind.
What if.
I had accepted Baekho's offer that day.
If I had waited endlessly in a place where I could come back anytime, would I be laughing and chatting alongside them now?
I don't know.
But one thing was certain.
"I wonder if this is what it feels like to have… a family."
There's no room for me in this house.
Yes, so…
Rustle.
I'm going home today.
Just as she made that decision.
Tap, tap.
The two women, who were enjoying their tea, charged towards her from both sides. 
It was too late to react. She had been lost in thought.
“…Eh, eh?!!”
By the time she came to her senses, her arms were bound and she was kneeling in the garden.
The situation was all too clear.
A former colleague… no, a former lover, suddenly appearing and sneaking a peek into the house, only to be caught.
"…"
What kind of excuse should I make in this situation?
"Ah, ahhaha…."
For now, she decided to greet them with an awkward smile.
"Oh, long time… no see. Bjorn… oof!"
It was a terrible reunion indeed.
***
A room on the second floor with a window overlooking the empty lot.
A woman stood by the window, biting her nails anxiously.
"Why did that woman come back now…? She left sir all those years ago…  She's… she's trying to take him from me again…."
Her mumbling words showed how unstable she was. She even spoke to Amelia, who was watching her from behind, worried she might do something rash.
"...I can't hear their conversation.  Did they use a magic device?  What, what can we do…?"
"It's not impossible."
"Then do it now…!"
"But Bjorn will hate it if he finds out?"
At that brief question, Erwen clamped her mouth shut. She bit her nails again and focused her gaze on the window.
Unable to watch any longer, Amelia casually shrugged.
"Why? It's not a lie, is it?"
She knew it.
Even if she appeared to be losing her mind, she wouldn't do anything that would make him hate her in this situation. This seemingly thorny fairy, deep down, was nothing more than a scaredy-cat who was always getting hurt and crying.
"…"
Erwen was the same as always.
She avoided answering questions that delved into the core of the matter, remaining silent.
'I don't have a hobby of meddling in other people's business…'
But I can't just leave her alone.
Amelia approached Erwen, who was standing by the window, and sat down on the chair next to her.
Then, she asked bluntly,
"Tersia, what kind of relationship do you want to have with Yandel?"
"…"
As usual, there was no answer.
Amelia would have assumed that she didn't want to talk and ended the conversation there, but she persisted.
"If your relationship stays the same, nothing will change even if Misha Kalstain comes back."
"…"
"Do you want to be romantically involved with Yandel?"
Finally, an answer came.
"That… it's not wrong, is it…?"
A typical answer from a coward.
"I didn't say it was wrong."
"...So, what are you trying to say?"
The cornered coward became aggressive, and Amelia retreated a step, as if hunting prey.
"I'm just curious. Why haven't you expressed your feelings properly, despite having such desires?"
"…"
"Don't you know? Yandel, that guy is perceptive, but he also overthinks everything, so he'll never approach you first."
"…"
"So tell me. Maybe I can help."
"...Hah! You helping me?"
Erwen scoffed as if she didn't believe it, then asked in return,
"What kind of relationship do you want to have with sir…?"
It was an embarrassing topic, but Amelia didn't back down. She answered honestly.
"Well, I'm content with the current situation. I'm already having enough fun."
She wasn't particularly opposed to Erwen's constant childish tantrums or to having to clean up after Yandel's crazy schemes.
Her reasons were incredibly simple.
"Like Yandel said, if we had a family, it would feel like this."
At those words, Erwen stared at Amelia, unable to utter a word. The malice in her eyes had disappeared, replaced by confusion.
"…"
"…"
A brief silence followed.
After a long hesitation, Erwen spoke in a small voice.
"...Tell me. What should I do?"
It felt like her thorny shell was finally cracking.
Amelia smiled gently, as if looking at a younger sister, and advised her,
"Be patient."
"...Wait?"
"Yes, because Bjorn will only run away now."
A hunter must first create an environment where the prey cannot escape.
Amelia calmly summed up the situation.
"Bjorn Yandel must have thought, 'Tersia can't make rational decisions right now. Her feelings are just an attempt to fill the void within herself. It's only temporary, and he didn't want to confront those feelings directly."
And one more thing she might have anticipated.
"He probably wished this relationship wouldn't crumble."
This fairy and this barbarian are similar. 
They may appear tough, but they are filled with anxieties and worries.
"That's why you have to be patient. If you approach him now, he'll only think, rationalize, and run away, claiming it's a rational decision."
"How long…?"
"Until he thinks you've erased your essence and are completely normal."
If she reveals her feelings then, Yandel will no longer be able to turn a blind eye, and will have to confront them head-on.
"Of course, I don't mean just wait around. You have to continue to interact emotionally while you wait."
"...For example?"
"Use honorifics."
"...For example?"
Amelia then shared some techniques for romance, and Erwen listened intently, her pointy ears twitching. Amelia's techniques were amazing.  Especially because she found them all believable.
"Like going up to him when he's dressing and helping him tie his tie…"
After the lesson, Erwen asked with a look of wonder,
"Do you… do you have any experience dating guys?"
"…………No."
Erwen frowned as if her trust in her had diminished.
"Wait, then how did you know all this?"
Amelia chuckled awkwardly.
This is something he always used as an excuse, though.
"...I read it in a book."
Well, it's true.
***
A little over ten days had passed since her encounter with Baekho. The reunion she had been waiting for had finally arrived.
'I never imagined our reunion would be like this.'
Her mind went blank for a moment, but she prioritized getting Amelia and Misha inside. Then, she activated a portable voice-activated magic device to prevent any sounds from leaking out.
She was worried that this meeting might agitate Erwen.
"…"
"…"
The two of them stood there, silently staring at each other.
It was far from a tender feeling.
Even though they weren't in a fight, her tense muscles made her neck stiff.
'…Why do I feel so awkward?'
She decided to throw out a line.
"Your hair… it's grown a lot."
"Ah… this… yeah…."
It wasn't a response that led to further conversation.
But I had to speak before the awkwardness grew.
"I don't think I've ever seen you tie your hair up like that before."
"No? I did it a lot when I was cooking… ah, no… I, I… did?"
The old Misha was starting to show.
For some reason, she found herself laughing, feeling more relaxed.
"Just talk comfortably. Don't be so formal. We're not strangers, so who would judge you for it."
"But… I'm really all better now… all thanks to you.  While you were gone…."
"...All better?"
"Yeah. Sometimes… I revert back when I'm nervous, but I'm all better now.  I, I mean…."
So, she's nervous too.
Not just me.
"Ah, anyway, I have to go now, I'm busy—."
What is she saying?
Doesn't she understand the situation yet?
"Where do you think you're going?"
I immediately stepped forward and grabbed her wrist tightly.
'…Why are you so thin?'
At least, if she tries to run, she can't escape unless she uses a Blink-type skill.
Ah, I wonder if she's learned that skill too.
Since they were apart for so long, nothing is certain.
"Misha Kalstain."
I looked at her and spoke firmly.
"You're not going anywhere."
