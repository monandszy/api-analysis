## Coming Out (1)
The royal family wants to arrange a marriage between me and a noblewoman of human descent. There are many possible interpretations of this action. A naive person might be thrilled, believing the royal family favors me and intends to support me from now on. But…
“Raphir, I have a question.”
“Ask away.”
“Are they trying to put a leash on me?”
My question hung in the air, met with silence from Dragon Uncle. He couldn’t answer easily.
“Well, I’m not sure about that. But...your choice will be an answer to the royal family.”
“If I marry a human, it would mean submitting to them… .”
“And if you refuse, it would mean the opposite.”
I finally understood why Dragon Uncle had said that I would be used for political gain regardless of who I married.
“Raphir, does that promise still stand?”
“The unconditional support and cooperation of the Dragonkin towards you? Yes, it still stands. Of course, I’m talking about a situation where the king isn’t involved, as we discussed then.”
“I see…”
“But are you thinking too negatively? ”
“It’s just a habit, to assume the worst-case scenario first.”
I needed some time to think about this, so I asked Dragon Uncle a few more questions before ending the topic.
“The king’s involvement is unknown, and I don’t even know who the marriage candidate is… .”
Still, I had received a heads-up, so I could remain calm and respond strategically at the royal council meeting.
“So, if the marriage is first, what’s second?”
I inquired about the second piece of news that Dragon Uncle hadn’t mentioned, and received an unexpected response.
“The second is the Labyrinth’s closure.”
“Closure?”
“Exactly. I’m not sure about the reasons, but the Labyrinth’s closure will be on the agenda for the royal council meeting.”
“So, it’s not final?”
“Not exactly. It’s just formally proposed for discussion, but I believe it’s already been internally decided.”
“I see…”
I inquired about the schedule for the closure and other related details, but Dragon Uncle seemed unaware of such specifics.
“…”
As I stood there, lost in thought, Dragon Uncle spoke to me.
“I have one more piece of advice for you, if you don’t mind.”
“I welcome it.”
I nodded, and Dragon Uncle repeated what I had said during the Interracial Summit.
“You are the Clan Leader of the Barbarian Tribe, and a Baron in the Laphdonia Kingdom. You are also the master of the rapidly growing Anabada Clan.”
I already knew what he was getting at.
“Regardless of how you see yourself, you can no longer live as just a warrior.”
The warriors of the Holy Ground.
The thousands of Bipron residents who have become our family retainers.
And my companions.
“Don’t you have countless people to be responsible for? Regardless of how you think and act, your marriage won’t just be yours.”
Dragon Uncle was speaking to me.
No, more accurately, he was scolding me very gently.
“Make a choice for them. For your own sake.”
It felt like he had slapped me in the back of the head.
Of course, from Dragon Uncle’s perspective, my delaying the marriage looked like an evasion of responsibility.
Arranged marriages among nobles weren’t a matter of choice.
For them, love was romantic, and across all ages, romance always meant inefficiency.
“That’s all I wanted to tell you. I hope you didn’t take it too harshly.”
“Harshly? There’s no truth to that. What you said was right.”
Perhaps I’m a romantic.
It’s not that I haven’t shed the modern-day skin… . After all, even in modern times, there were many similar cases.
Even outside of things like arranged marriages between chaebol families, isn’t there a saying?
Marriage is reality.
“I hope it was helpful.”
“Don’t worry. It was very helpful.”
This wasn’t just a polite lie. I mean it.
Thanks to him, I know what to do now.

“What about Raviyen?”
“Well, she doesn’t come to the Holy Ground often these days. Actually, I don’t even know where she is or what she’s doing.”
“Don’t you talk to her much?”
“You’ll understand when you have children of your own. You can’t have a conversation just because you want to.”
“I see.”
“At some point, you stop talking unless it’s necessary. Ravi, she wasn’t like that when she was younger… .”
Seeing Dragon Uncle grumble made me laugh a little.
Do all parents of grown children become like this?
Anyway, after talking with Dragon Uncle, I met with his young dragon daughter, Pen, for the first time in a long time.
“You came? I thought you wouldn’t come at all.”
“Are you saying that knowing full well my circumstances?”
“I’m glad. You’ve come back alive.”
“…”
Was it because she was the one who gave me the Dragon Slayer’s heart?
Even her snarky attitude was almost entirely gone, replaced by a warmer demeanor.
“But… don’t you see anything different about me?”
“I don’t.”
“I’ve grown taller, this much!”
“Oh.”
Come to think of it, she had grown a little taller.
Well, she was still in a child-like developmental stage.
“She had her growth stopped because of the curse from the Dragon Slayer back then… .”
She must be growing again as her body recovers.
“Just wait a bit. I’ll be just like my sister soon.”
“Uh… .”
Becoming like Raviyen was a bit too much of a dream.
If she had only grown this much in almost a year, even when fully grown she would still be in the child category.
Of course, it was impossible for me to say that to her now that she was healthy.
“Yes, yes. I’ll support you.”
“Anyway, tell me everything while you’re here.”
We spent time together, and I told her about exploring the underground first floor. I spent the night at the Dragon Sanctuary.
The next day, Dragon Uncle, Pen, and I had breakfast together before leaving for the Imperial City, Karnon, early in the morning.
And…
“Nobility is nice.”
I arrived at the Palace of Wisdom, where the royal council meeting was being held a day early. I spent the day playing and eating in the assigned VIP room.
Or, at least, that’s what I intended to do.
But…
Knock knock.
As if they knew, nobles kept coming to my room as soon as I arrived.
“Haha, I heard Baron Yandel arrived early, so I came to visit. Would you care to have some tea and engage in some conversation?”
A genuine visitor seeking social interaction.
“I have a proposition for Baron Yandel. Would you listen? I guarantee you won’t lose.”
A merchant disguised as a businessman.
“I heard you’re looking for a marriage partner… .”
A child peddler.
And…
“What is this?”
A mysterious letter slipped through the crack under the door.
[Midnight, garden fountain, come quietly.]
The letter contained only these three lines. It lacked the sender’s name or any other details.
I considered what to do, but…
“How can I resist a mysterious letter?”
Eventually, when midnight came and the appointed time arrived, I sneaked out through the window and headed to the designated location.
The fountain, situated at the heart of the labyrinthine garden.
As I waited there, the mysterious figure who sent the letter soon appeared.
“Jerome Saintred.”
The First Royal Knights’ Captain, a man of noble rank, known as the Knight of Light, the kingdom’s protector.
Or, more accurately, the ancient hero who had seized his body.
The Dragon Knight, Cornelius Bruengrid.
“I didn’t know it was you who sent the letter.”
“Meeting in secret seemed like the best option. Thankfully, there were no rats following.”
“So, why did you call me?”
I asked straight to the point, and the village elder frowned.
“Are you really asking that because you don’t know? Or are you just saying that indirectly to refuse to keep your promise?”
Oh, right.
I had promised to return his item after leaving.
I hurriedly opened my subspace and took out the Karui heart that the village elder had entrusted to me.
“It feels a bit off, but I did promise.”
It was not like I had a choice.
I didn’t know what kind of extreme actions the village elder might take if I didn’t give it back.
“…”
After receiving the item, the village elder carefully examined it for any problems, then tucked it away.
“Well, is that all then?”
“The most important part, anyway.”
“There’s more?”
I stared at the village elder, my senses on high alert, anticipating the real reason he had called me.
But…
“The royal council will discuss your marriage.”
“I know.”
“So, you’re quick on the uptake.”
I was determined to maintain a poker face, no matter what he said.
“You should marry that woman. It’s the last lifeline the royal family throws at you.”
“Lifeline…? What the hell are you trying to say?”
“Exactly what it sounds like. If you don’t accept their offer, you and your companions will likely not be safe.”
Was it because this guy had lived as a monster for too long?
As an ordinary Barbarian, I couldn’t keep up with the tempo of this conversation.
“I don’t understand. Explain it slowly, with more details.”
“The royal family… No, to be precise, the Prime Minister is wary of your growth. You can have multiple wives legally, and there are many women who would be suitable.”
Misha Kalstain, the daughter of the Red Cat Clan leader.
Erwen, the one with pure Elven blood.
And…
“Dragon Uncle’s daughters too.”
Of course, I’m not a playboy, and I have no intention of marrying all of them.
But from their perspective, where marriage is seen only as a ‘political strategy’, it’s understandable why they’d be wary.
To be honest, it’s a little hard for me to say this myself.
But it’s understandable that they would be concerned about the situation where the legendary hero from the Barbarian Tribe unites various races.
However, there was also a contradiction in this.
“I understand what you mean. But what’s the point of marrying a human noblewoman? If I marry her, I can still—.”
“Because it’s impossible.”
“…What?”
When I hesitated, the village elder chuckled at me.
“Laphdonia noble law stipulates that even a titled noble can only have one wife if… .”
“Ah.”
I suddenly remembered a law I had forgotten.
“If the wife is also a titled noble… .”
“You know. To be precise, it applies when the spouse’s title is higher, but… . It’s strange how this law hasn’t changed for thousands of years.”
The village elder continued to ramble about some old-timer stuff, but none of it registered in my ears.
“Wait a minute… .”
Among Laphdonia’s noble families, cases where women inherit titles are very rare.
And among them, those who hold a title of Baron or higher are even rarer… .
“Is there a titled noblewoman who’s still unmarried… ?”
To my knowledge, there isn’t.
…No, there wasn’t.
At least, not when I first became a noble and was studying this stuff.
Time always brings change.
“Wait, wait… .”
There was one woman in Laphdonia at this moment who had a title higher than mine and was still unmarried.
“Is it Countess Ragna Peprok? Is she my marriage candidate?”
“That’s right.”
“…”
What the hell, Duke? Are you crazy?
