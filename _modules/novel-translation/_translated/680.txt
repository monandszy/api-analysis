## The Dream (7)
The space was shrouded in utter darkness.
A flash!
Light, like the dawn breaking, erupted from beyond the horizon, instantly painting the world in its radiance.
Whoosh!
A gale whipped through the space, so powerful that I felt myself being sucked into it.
Beep, beep, beep, beep!
A shrill ringing accompanied by a throbbing headache pulsed in my mind. New knowledge began to etch itself into my memory. Was it truly new?
“Whew, I’m alive.”
In the dream, the psychiatrist had asked me to speak in the language of Laphdonia. I had stammered, unable to utter a single word, and was incredibly embarrassed.
Well, now that I’m back, it no longer matters.
Swish.
I lowered my head, focusing on my hands. Unlike the small, delicate hands of Lee Han-soo, these were coarse, rough, and riddled with thick veins, the hands of a barbarian.
Clench.
I clenched and unclenched my fists repeatedly, checking my physical condition. But the familiar sound of footsteps soon drew my attention.
Click, click.
I turned towards the sound, and there she was.
Click.
The girl I had glimpsed when I was dragged into the dream world appeared as if by magic, her presence ghostly.
"Elis Groundia."
The moment I whispered her name, the Witch of the Earth halted, her eyes fixed on me.
“I told you not to come back.”
“...”
“Why did you return?”
Her voice held a hint of sorrow.
I chuckled and replied, “This is where I belong.”
Perhaps my answer wasn’t sufficient. The girl, her expression indignant, looked up at me, her voice charged with accusation. 
“This was the world where your dream became reality.”
“But it was a fake.”
“You know it wasn’t a fake, don’t you?”
Hmm, I suppose...
I couldn’t deny that I had become increasingly aware that this wasn’t just a simple dream world as time passed there. 
However, as I mentioned before, 
“It doesn’t matter. That’s not my place.”
I reaffirmed my decision with resolute conviction. The girl remained silent for a while.
Whoosh!
The wind continued to blow relentlessly. And with the passage of time, the world was bathed in a white light that now occupied more than half of its expanse.
Crackle.
Something shattered, and a line of demarcation formed between me and the Witch of the Earth, a boundary between darkness and light.
"I think I’ve made my intentions clear. Time to send me back, wouldn’t you say?”
I spoke, breaking the silence that had stretched, short yet long. The Witch of the Earth clenched her fists, her posture childish.
“You will face more hardships and sorrow in that place.”
Oh, so that’s how she wants to play it.
"Do you still want to go back?”
It was a childish question befitting her appearance, but I answered earnestly.
"Yes. I’m going back."
There was no room for debate in my mind about that cruel world where I was always on edge, fearing a blow to the back of my head, constantly worried about the survival of myself and my companions.
"You will lose something precious. The pain you’ve endured will seem insignificant compared to the despair you will face.”
Just hearing those words made my breath catch in my throat.
“So, what do you want me to do?”
Isn’t that just the way life is? 
It’s hard, painful, and you always want to run away.
Lee Han-soo always fled reality, so he spent his entire life unaware.
He never knew that running away wasn't the solution.
The life of a warrior taught me that. 
Yes, so…
“No matter how much it hurts, I’m going forward.”
“Whatever kind of shitstorm I face, I’ll struggle tooth and nail to survive to the very end.”
“I’m a barbarian.”
As soon as I finished speaking, the girl took a step back as I stepped forward, past the boundary of darkness where she stood.
Whoosh!
The darkness receded as I advanced, as if in response to my movement.
Oh, this is getting interesting.
Thump.
I took another, larger step.
The girl didn’t take a step back. She simply stood where she was, her voice reaching out to me.
“You…”
Thump.
“Have chosen the path of Bjorn Yandell.”
Thump.
The witch smiled, a melancholic expression that had no apparent reason behind it.
"You, in the end, were no different… from us.”
...What?
"Us? What are you talking about?”
I halted my steps, my question hanging in the air. But there was no reply.
“Pretending not to run away, but escaping even the realization that you are running away.”
"No, I mean, what are you even—."
I was just taking another, larger step when—
“Yes, we were right.”
The girl turned her back on me and vanished into the darkness.
Click, click.
The sound of her shoes faded into the distance, and with it, the darkness retreated.
“Hey, wait!”
I tried to chase after her, but somehow the distance between us didn’t close, even though she was walking slowly.
Click.
The faint sound of her shoes faded entirely, and the world was consumed by light.
“Yan… Nam… Dell Baron…!”
A man’s voice, booming like thunder, reverberated through the entire space.
The voice, which had previously been intermittent, as if a broken record, became suddenly clear.
“Aaa! You bastard, Yandell Baron!”
“Haah….”
The ending was a bit unsatisfying, but…
“Aagh! Wake up already! Pleaseeeeee!”
“I’m awake, stop shaking me.”
“...Huh?”
I’m back.
Back to where I belong.
***
Truthfully, I had been a bit worried. 
Where would I end up after clearing [Dungeon and Stone] again?
Would I be stuck in the body of a completely different barbarian, forced to start all over again with the Rite of Passage?
Or would I wake up in a world decades before, or even decades after?
Would I be greeted by the aged faces of a few survivors in a future where my companions and I had vanished into the annals of history? 
Well, my worries were just figments of my imagination.
“Stop shaking me, I’m awake.”
I opened my eyes, finding myself on the deck of a ship.
I was sprawled out on the deck, soaked to the bone. Baek-ho was shaking me by the shoulders when…
“...Huh? Hy… no, Baron? Oh, you’re awake! Are you alright?”
Baek-ho, startled by my sudden awakening, stepped back.
I swiftly asked the most important question.
“What’s the situation? Are we in danger?”
"Ah, no. The danger is over."
Oh, well that’s a relief.
My last memory was being chased by Dryisen and falling into the water. Baek-ho had been shaking me so urgently, I thought it was some kind of emergency.
"How long was I out?”
"Not long.”
“Exactly, in terms of time.”
“Um… about 30 minutes?”
30 minutes…
It was a relief, but also a bit disheartening.
I had spent at least half a year in that place.
"How are the others?”
"The mages are exhausted and meditating, the rest are fine as you can see."
Okay, it seems like nothing major happened while I was asleep.
So, I could take my time and hear about what had happened while I was gone.
“Tell me what happened after I fell overboard. Don’t leave anything out.”
Baek-ho readily began his narrative, recognizing the importance of sharing information. 
It was a simple story, in summary. 
"When I saw you fall into the water, I jumped in after you.”
Baek-ho jumped into the water to save me.
He said that in the process, he almost died, as he was attacked by a bunch of awakened monsters. 
‘Just skip the unnecessary heroics.’
Baek-ho, however, managed to save me from drowning. It was a good thing I was so heavy, thanks to my barbarian physique and armor. 
Otherwise, he said, I would have been swept away by the current and fallen into the waterfall, and if that had happened, he would have been unable to save me.
“Then I barely made it back onto the ship, and we escaped.”
"That easily…?"
I wasn’t fully convinced. Even if the mages had used all of their magical energy to activate the defensive magic circle on the ship, it was unbelievable that they had survived long enough to save me from Dryisen, a Level 1 ‘Special Boss’. 
And then it all ends with ‘we just escaped’?
“To be honest, I don’t understand it either, but that’s all there is to it. He just let us go as we ran for our lives. He barely touched the ship when we were holding our ground in the first place.”
According to Baek-ho’s explanation, Dryisen’s actions raised many questions.
That wasn’t the usual way he behaved.
But, since he said so, I decided to let it go. 
"But then why were you so desperate to wake me? It didn’t seem like we were in any immediate danger.”
The next question I asked was met with an odd reaction from Baek-ho.
"You think I’d ask that if I knew? No… ah, I don’t know.”
"What are you playing at?”
I looked at him with disbelief, and Baek-ho coughed repeatedly, then continued as if nothing had happened.
“Ahem! Of course, I had to be urgent. You were dead, Baron!”
“...What?”
"I was terrified you were going to die!”
Now that I took a closer look, Baek-ho was a mess. His claim of almost dying in the water was no exaggeration. 
He was soaked through, his gear was broken, and he had numerous wounds that hadn’t healed yet.
‘He was shouting like that because my heart stopped while he was in that state?’
It made me embarrassed that I had seriously considered pushing him overboard in the chaos. 
But…
‘He saved me because he had a purpose. Not out of genuine concern for me.’
In the end, Baek-ho had saved me for his own benefit.
So, I decided not to be too grateful.
After all, isn’t that the mindset that fits into the harsh reality of Laphdonia?
“Baek-ho, I have a question.”
"What is it?”
"No, forget it. It’s nothing.”
“What is it? Hyung, you want to see me go crazy?”
I flinched at the sudden ‘Hyung,’ but luckily the other members didn’t seem to mind. 
This guy had always called everyone ‘Hyung,’ regardless of who they were.
“What is it! What is it! What is it! Tell me! Tell me! Tell me!”
“I told you, it’s nothing.”
“Aagh!! You’re making me go insane!!”
Baek-ho, even louder than usual, made me want to give him the answer and get some peace and quiet. But I thought better of it. 
Because…
‘Why didn’t you leave me to die.’
That was the question I really wanted to ask.
This guy had once planned to kill me and resurrect me using the ‘Stone of Resurrection.’
He could have used the ‘Stone of Resurrection’ to revive me after I died today. Then, he could have erased my memories and manipulated me as he saw fit. 
But…
‘He didn’t know, did he?’
If you think about it, he couldn’t have been sure if I was still carrying the ‘Stone of Resurrection.’
Misha could have kept it. Or, I could have entrusted it to someone I trust.
This guy is smart, so he probably judged that I was the most likely to have it.
‘He can’t enter my subspace before he kills me, so this was a gamble for him.’
So, I stopped myself from asking the question.
The moment I mentioned it, he would know I’m holding the ‘Stone of Resurrection.’
It could have led to complications. 
‘It’s really hitting me, being back here.’
As I chuckled at that thought, Baek-ho, his face alight with newfound realization, asked me a question. 
“Ah, right! I’ll drop that question about what you were about to ask. But can I ask you something else?”
"Go ahead.”
"You were smiling in your sleep…."
"So?”
"What kind of dream did you have?”
I paused, considering his question.
‘What dream, you ask…?’
I knew if I told him everything that happened, he would surely think I was crazy.
Just like how people in that world thought of me.
If I told him about the Witch of the Earth, or the parallel world, he would dismiss it as hallucinations caused by the field effect.
‘Thinking about it, it’s kind of funny.’
What’s even funnier is, I don’t know either.
Were the things I experienced just a dream, or did I truly visit another reality?
Was the witch real or an illusion?
Thump.
I’m still a bit confused.
As soon as I woke up, the memories of that place began to fade. 
It’s like when you wake up from a dream, you only remember certain scenes.
“No, why won’t you say? Did you have a naughty dream? Maybe you were trapped in a hallucinatory paradise, a world of pleasure, and couldn’t escape?”
"It wasn’t like that, stop talking nonsense."
“Come on, Hyung, we’re close. You can tell me this much.”
Close? What are we close about?
I wanted to ask that back, but I knew it would lead to a longer conversation, so I just shortened my answer.
There’s no need for too much detail.
It’s something everyone experiences at least once in their life.
“It was just a stupid dream.”
So, there’s no reason to be disappointed.
