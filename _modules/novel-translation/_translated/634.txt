##  Reconstruction (3)
There was Supervisor A. A supervisor who had assigned an excessive workload and hadn't shown their face for over half a year. That supervisor, after a long absence, returned with 8,712 new tasks.
How would a subordinate feel in this situation? The answer to that question can be found in the expression on Shabin Emue’s face, standing before me now.
Her hands trembled uncontrollably. Her gaze was fixed on one point, burning with anger. And...
‘A killing intent...?’ How could a normal person radiate such a chilling aura? I couldn’t comprehend it, but...
“I… I’m quitting—,” I hastily interrupted Shabin before the word could be complete. “Shabin! Calm down! Our tribe will fall apart without you!”
“If this place is so fragile that one person leaving would cause its downfall, wouldn't it be better to just collapse already?”
Well… she wasn’t wrong, but…
“W-why are you saying this? I’ve treated you well all this time—.”
“Then does that mean I haven’t been treated well?”
“No, that’s not what I meant…,” I stammered. A family-like atmosphere is a common characteristic of small and medium-sized enterprises, but I had already discarded the idea of persuading her with loyalty. 
I knew better than anyone how to resolve the manpower shortage plaguing these companies. To keep those who were tired of the family-like culture and wanted to leave, you need more than just moral speeches.
“Double.”
“Double?”
“Yes. I’ll give you double your current salary!”
At the news of a drastic salary increase, a slight crack appeared in the icy expression on Shabin Emue’s face. “Y-you can’t expect me to—!”
This was my chance to use a combo move. “I’m not talking just about the future!”
“...?”
“I’ll pay you double for the time you spent alone in the sacred ground while I was away!”
“...!!!”
A groundbreaking bonus promise, enough to make even a departing subordinate open their eyes wide.
“...” She didn’t immediately answer, perhaps a bit embarrassed, but her expression showed she had completely disarmed. 
I decided to refrain from pestering her further and patiently gave her time to think. Shabin slowly opened her mouth.
“... I'll do it.”
A tiny voice, barely audible.
“What was that?”
“... I'll take it! The position of Administrative Secretary!”
She then declared with a loud voice, as if she had finally made up her mind. But then, as if she had suddenly become embarrassed, her face flushed red.
She followed with a hasty excuse. “I... I’m at the age to start preparing for marriage, too.”
This was a completely unexpected reason.
“... ”  She’s not at the age to start preparing; she’s way past it, isn’t she? I thought she was going to turn forty in a few years. 
Unless it was modern society where first marriages were delayed, this was definitely too late—
“I see.”
Just then, Amelia nodded in agreement. “It’s about time for her to think about those things at her age.”
… Well, I’m glad I didn’t say anything.
***
Administrative Secretary, Shabin Emue. Her skills were genuine, and today she assumed the position of the highest authority in the administration and clerical fields.
“I have some land I was planning to sell next year. We can accommodate these people there. It might be a bit cramped, though.”
As if she had anticipated this situation, Shabin managed to accommodate 8,712 refugees, making my previous concerns about her departure seem irrelevant.
“The roof is an issue… but I have some materials ready, so it shouldn’t take long to build temporary shelters.”
“You say it won’t take long? With this many people? Are you sure it’s possible?”
“Of course. You’ve been away for so long, so you might not know… but the barbarians are naturally gifted workers. Maybe they are even more naturally inclined towards this kind of work than being warriors.”
“... What?”
It was a statement that felt like pressing a button as the tribe leader of the barbarians, but the subsequent results forced me to acknowledge its truth.
As if demonstrating their ability to stand against a hundred men, the warriors...
“Behel—raaaaaaaaaaa!!”
Lifted enormous logs with a single roar and carried them alone.
“Over there in the middle! You need to plant the middle pillar firmly, like our muscles!”
Because building their own houses within the sacred ground is a trend, they even possess construction skills. 
Well, not as good as the dwarves, but…
“Over there! It’s crooked!”
“It’s a hassle. Just set it up!”
“Alright!”
Is this the limitation of their birth?
The dwarves, with their unique craftsmanship and recognized for their expertise in smelting and architecture, were unmatched in their attention to detail. But…
“It’s fast, isn’t it?”
“Indeed…”
With all the barbarians of the sacred ground working together, the speed was simply insane.
It seemed like they could finish building all the temporary shelters to accommodate the refugees within just a few days.
‘Well, it’s built in a hurry, so it’ll probably collapse in a year…’
However, I still realized something important.
‘The barbarians are cost-effective…!’
No, it wasn’t just good. It was insane.
Incredibly cheap labor.
Yet, they had the physical strength to do the work of several people alone.
And, most importantly...
‘They have no complaints.’
Even if they were overworked at a cheap price, they just accepted it with a positive attitude.
There was no reason to feel pride hurt by Shabin’s statement that they were born workers.
Because it was still an understatement.
Without a doubt, the barbarian warriors were the strongest workers of this era—.
“Yandel.”
As I was overwhelmed by the newfound possibilities, someone called out to me from behind.
A familiar voice.
“... Rotmiller?”
“Long time no see. I intended to visit sooner, but you seemed busy.”
“What are you doing here in the sacred ground?”
I truly asked out of curiosity. Rotmiller, however, simply stared back at me with an expression like she had heard a strange sound.
“Yandel, it was you, wasn't it? The one who asked me to teach the exploration skills to the young warriors of the sacred ground.”
“Ah…” 
That was right.
I, too, had forgotten.
“I apologize. I’ve been swamped with work lately. I completely forgot.”
“I understand. You’ve been through a lot lately, haven’t you?”
“I appreciate you saying that… but anyway, did you stay in the sacred ground all this time?”
“Unless I have a particular need to go to the city. I find teaching my skills to the young warriors fulfilling and it suits my personality.”
“Oh, really?”
“I’m not exaggerating. I feel so proud when they come back alive from the labyrinth thanks to the skills I taught them. They even give me stone bread as a reward, saying my teachings were helpful. It makes my heart swell with joy…”
Rotmiller suddenly trailed off, then coughed awkwardly with a slightly embarrassed expression.
“Ahem! Anyway, I’m living a decent life, so you don’t have to worry about me.”
“I, I see…?”
“Ah, and I’ve been helping with administrative tasks in my spare time after finishing my own work.”
“Administrative tasks…?”
“Emue is struggling a lot. I can’t bear to watch a young girl like her toil so hard…”
“Huh? Shabin Emue is… young…?”
“Didn’t you know? She’s two years younger than me. Ah, well, age doesn’t really matter, does it? Even though she’s two years younger, she’s accomplished so much more than me…”
Rotmiller let out a self-deprecating laugh as she said this.
Suddenly, I was struck by a thought like lightning.
‘… Was it that Shabin was preparing for marriage or something?’
This thought crossed my mind, but I didn’t dare ask something as insensitive as what their relationship was.
They would figure it out themselves. They’re not children anymore.
“Ah, right, Yandel… Do you know what happened to the Bifron region? Everyone’s worried, even though they don’t show it.”
“I’ll let you know if I hear anything. Right now, I’m completely in the dark.”
“I see…”
We chatted about various things for another 30 minutes, then Shabin Emue came looking for me.
“Lord Byron… Oh? Rotmiller-ssi, you are here, too?”
“Nice to see you, Emue-ssi. I finished the surveying work I promised you yesterday, and I ran into Yandel on my way back. We were just having a conversation.”
“Oh, really? You already finished surveying?”
“Why would I delay it? I know you’re busy, Emue-ssi.”
“Yes… Thank you always, Rotmiller-ssi…”
Shabin Emue, covering her mouth, smiled like a young lady at Rotmiller’s words.
‘Tsk, there’s definitely something going on between them.’
My warrior instincts were telling me this, but I had no business interfering. So I decided to change the subject.
“Shabin, why did you come looking for me?”
“Oh, my! Where’s my head? I received letters this morning. Three of them.”
“Three?”
I checked the letters Shabin handed me and found they all had different senders.
“One is from the Royal Family, one from Melvess, and the other is from…?”
I couldn’t tell.
What the heck is this?
As I pondered, the knowledgeable Shabin Emue gave an explanation.
“That seal signifies a letter from a racial community. Judging by the timing, it’s most likely an invitation to a racial conference.”
“Racial conference… ”
That’s right. I had forgotten about this event.
A gathering of representatives from the six races to hold a conference. 
I actually should have been there, but I was trapped on the first floor for a long time, so I was unable to attend.
“Did the conference take place while I was gone?”
“No. I don’t think it was held. I heard it’s tradition that the conference only happens when everyone is present.”
“... I see.”
My doubts were cleared up. I then proceeded to open and read the rest of the letters one by one.
Coincidentally, all of the letters contained official matters. Let me briefly summarize each one:
1. Royal Council Participation Authority Notice.
2. Melvess Regular Meeting Participation Request.
3. Racial Conference Consent Form.
Being a tribal leader and holding a Baron title, I guess that’s why I’m receiving these kinds of letters. 
Reading them makes me feel like a high-ranking politician, somehow.
… Well, technically, it’s not wrong.
“Wow…”
Shabin gasped in admiration after confirming the senders and content of the letters. Then, she murmured to me in a strange tone.
“Seeing things like this, you really are an incredible person…”
It sounded like a compliment, but it had a mocking tone.
“What did you just say?”
“Nothing, just that it’s amazing to see someone who receives these kinds of letters standing right in front of me.”
“... Don’t be silly.”
Slightly embarrassed, I focused on the content of the letters once more.
“So what are you going to do about this?”
“What do you mean?”
“You received invitations from three places, and they all seem important. Are you going to attend all of them?”
“I guess I have to. They are all official matters.”
“Then where are you going first?”
Ah, that.
Unfortunately, that’s not a decision I can make.
“Hmm, let me see… the earliest one is…”
I picked up one of the letters.
“This one.”
It was an invitation to the Melvess regular meeting, the Interracial Noble Alliance.
***
Since I’m back in the city, there are many things I need to do. 
But if I had to pick one thing that needs to be solved first, it would be this.
It wasn’t originally on my quest list, but…
[Use the refugees currently living in the barbarian sacred ground to make money.]
The refugees are all now my vassals.
And under the royal law, it is impossible for vassals of a noble family to work a second job and make money.
Well, it might be possible if done secretly, but…
I need to be careful not to give the Royal Family any reason to hold a grudge, and I can’t possibly make all 8,712 people work a second job.
‘I need to generate profits somehow if I want to pay next year’s taxes… ’
This is the biggest problem.
If I were a grand noble who owned businesses, I could have given them jobs by placing them there, but that’s not the case for me.
‘What should I do?’
The answer to this dilemma surprisingly came from the Melvess regular meeting I attended to file my existence report.
“Alright, next on the agenda is the awarding of contracts for the reconstruction of the 7th and 13th Districts. As you all know, the Royal Family has announced that they will select three noble businesses for this reconstruction project.”
“... ”
“Given the massive profits involved, it is certain that countless noble families will participate in the bidding. So, Melvess will also be selecting one family to provide support behind the scenes.”
“... ”
“We plan to participate in the bidding with the Goldbeard Count’s family, who own multiple construction companies, as the main player. If there are no objections from any families, we will proceed immediately with the vote—.”
I removed my arms from my crossed position and stood up from my seat.
“I object!”
Our family must win this contract.
