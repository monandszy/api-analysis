## The Proposal
It wasn't a question, but a statement, a declaration. 
I tried to retort, but the Duke didn't give me a chance. 
"Of course you wouldn't admit it here. You might think it's a trap. So, just listen until I'm done."
"..."
"No matter what you say, I believe you are a Demon."
"..."
"That's why you discreetly erased all traces of your past when you were ennobled. A hero like you being a Demon would create dissonance in the public perception."
It was a topic I'd discussed with Amelia in the past. Why could I become a nobleman without any "verification"?
[*Perhaps the royal family knew and turned a blind eye. You were a hero in the city at the time.*]
...So, this was truly the reason.
"Demons will forever be the enemy of all citizens, and they are indeed a terrifying threat. They snatch away our lives, more fearsome than any beast in the Labyrinth."
The Duke's voice was laced with an invisible, profound anger.
"When news of your death in the Labyrinth reached me, I was secretly relieved. It was the best scenario for me, the one who must lead this nation, for you to disappear without your true nature being revealed."
This part was something I already knew. 
The Duke's ideal scenario was shattered soon after.
"But one fellow interfered. You know who he is, I'm sure. The shameless one with the name of Baekho."
The Duke was forced by Baekho's threats to publicly declare that Bjorn Jandel was a 'Demon,' and subsequently, he had to put the Demon Incorporation Policy on the table.
Well, it was a colossal policy, so it hasn't been enacted yet.
"That man ripped open my deepest wounds."
"...Deep wounds?"
"My son, Eltora Tercelion, is already dead. The being possessing his body now is a Demon whose name I don't even know."
"!!!"
I was genuinely shocked. Not because it was a new story, but because I never thought he'd confess this part of the story.
"Seeing your reaction, it seems you truly didn't know."
"I... never imagined."
"Anyway, that man used the truth about my son's condition as a weapon to threaten me. I had no choice but to yield to his threats as I couldn't immediately deal with my son's situation."
So what was the Duke trying to say? I didn't know, but I kept listening. Not all of it was something I knew, after all.
"The Demon Incorporation Policy must never be enacted. Even if becoming a Demon wasn't their intention, if we accept them... whose grief will ever soothe the souls of those whose bodies were stolen?"
In this conversation, I felt like I was seeing the Duke's true self for the first time.
"That's why you could easily create a cover story when you disappeared and returned. Ironically, to stop that man's plans, you couldn't be a Demon."
"...You had everything prepared."
"Yes.  I was working behind the scenes, fabricating false information, creating records, making your non-existent infiltration mission appear real. I made every preparation, ensuring no one could sense the truth."
Now, the puzzle pieces finally fell into place. I had suspected the whole scenario was too hastily put together, even for someone as influential as Duke Kearlunas.
But I never thought it was a meticulously planned scheme, prepared throughout my absence.
"Originally, I intended to announce your death during the mission when the time was right... But your return brought those plans to naught."
Understanding the Duke's intentions now, I clenched my fists.
"Is that why… you sent us to the Icerocks?"
The Duke calmly acknowledged without any change in expression.
"There's no point in pretending now. Yes, that's why I sent you. I thought if you died and disappeared before reclaiming your name, no problems would arise."
How could a person be so brazen?  All the honest conversation we'd just had? I wanted to punch him right in the face.
But…
[*I promised myself I'd hold back.*]
Didn't I vow on that icy ground that day?
This wasn't the time to unleash my anger. 
Yes, that's right.
"So… now tell me. Why are you saying all this?"
I asked the Duke, maintaining as much composure as possible.
It's not like the second-highest person in the nation is an idiot. He wouldn't suddenly turn emotional just because I once saved him.
Of course, my actions wouldn't be entirely without effect... 
But there must be a reason for him to bring up this topic, a valid reason.
"Because I'm confused."
...What?
"There's no reason for you to save me. You even wished for my death, and you aren't the type who'd try to ingratiate yourself with me."
Well, that's undeniably true.
But…
"Why did you risk your own life to save me? I couldn't understand it at all. But thinking about it, it wasn't just me."
The Duke continued, looking at me.
"You've saved countless lives. But you never had a reason to save those people. Thanks to that, I was able to reach a conclusion. Or rather, finally admit it."
"What was it...?"
"That you, despite being a Demon, are a person with the heart of a hero."
A hero…?
Honestly, even if he said it like that, I couldn't really feel it. I was just struggling to survive.
To survive alongside the people around me.
"Demon or not, you're someone who will leave a positive impact on this world."
Whatever my feelings were, I knew instinctively that what he'd say next was the main point.
"So, I make you an offer."
The Duke then spoke to me with shining eyes.
"Stand with us. Become a true citizen of this world and use your power to maintain balance and peace."
Maybe it's because he had built up the tension so thoroughly and delivered it with such a powerful, passionate voice?
The Duke's words had a compelling force, a power to draw people in.
However, I know.
That people who possess such power must stay vigilant.
[*Oh, almost got swept up in that.*]
There are two types of people in the world. 
The type who hears an "offer" and only sees the good parts, building up their hope, and the opposite type.
I always strive to be the latter.
Therefore…
"Use my power? That's a strange request. I'm already doing that."
I gave a vague answer, demanding the Duke to reveal more of his cards.
"Stop with the nonsense about Demons. If you want something, why don't you just come clean?"
The Duke wasn't flustered by my demand. As if he'd expected it, he chuckled and continued.
"Well, I don't want nothing, of course."
"Then tell me."
"Even if you were to stand by my side now, I wouldn't have any proof to trust you. I need evidence."
Wait, didn't he just conclude that I was a 'good' Demon?
This guy's a master at turning things on a dime, changing his position like it's nothing… 
"Baekho."
The air suddenly chilled.
"Kill that man, the one who only seeks to disrupt the balance of this world."
So, this was his true objective.
"Then I'd be able to trust you completely."
As I suspected, he wouldn't turn into a 'good guy' just because I saved him once.
***
A brief silence followed.
The Duke added, as if trying to convince me.
"If you're uncomfortable with that, think of it as a deal.  If you take care of Baekho, I'll be your staunch protector while you live in this world."
It would be reassuring if it really happened. The Duke has enough power to smooth things over, even if I were to announce in the middle of the city that I'm a Demon.
But that's why I'm even more suspicious.
Leaving aside the fact that the Duke wants Baekho dead…
"Why are you trying to make me do this?"
Why didn't the Duke handle it himself? Why is he trying to put this on me?
"Because you're the only one who can."
The Duke's answer was unexpected.
"Honestly, I've tried countless times, but every attempt has failed. We couldn't even reach the man. But... you might be different. He seemed rather interested in you, for some reason."
"..."
"Of course, you don't have to decide right now, and you don't have to tell me if you do. Just remember. The moment you bring that man's head, you'll have nothing to worry about."
"..."
"Make the right choice. Don't you love this world? Unlike the other Demons."
Having said that, the Duke took a sip of his now-cold tea, as if he'd said all he needed to. The conversation reached a temporary stalemate.
The Duke remained relaxed, never initiating further discussion. With every passing moment, my mind became more entangled.
What should I say? Or what else should I ask?
It doesn't matter. No matter what I say, the Duke's mind won't change. And whatever answers I hear, I won't be able to trust them 100%.
Just like the research director I met in the basement.
[*The only way to find truth through others is to trust them. So, even if I speak at length, it'll only be a waste of time.*]
[*That's why I called it a deal. Does it matter who I am? You decide based solely on my offer.*]
It always comes down to personal judgment.
[*Well, he just said to keep it in mind…*]
It's like a side quest, really.
Even if I don't complete it, it won't cause any problems. Right?
"I'll think about your offer. Of course, I'm not some Demon."
After a long silence, the Duke nodded, his face devoid of any lingering affection.
"As you wish. At least the debt is settled now, so my mind is at ease."
"..."
"What do you mean? I just said I'd think about it."
"It's just that I can't sleep well unless I settle things, good or bad."
"Ah, are you talking about the 7th District construction project—."
"Not that."
The Duke then shrugged and continued.
"Showing you the right path. That's my reward for you saving me."
"..."
"Whether you believe me or not is up to you, but..."
He really has a knack for leaving people with a lingering sense of unease.
"...I'll be going now."
"Why don't you have dinner first? It feels wrong to let you leave just like this."
"I'm not really hungry today."
If I eat with the Duke in this situation, my head will explode. So, I left his mansion like I was running away.
Then, I boarded the carriage the Duke had provided and headed towards the military lift platform, closing my eyes tightly.
Today was truly a drain on my mental energy.
Clickety-clack, clickety-clack…
The gentle sound of the carriage wheels rolling on the ground. As I used it as background music to clear my mind, drowsiness crept in...
"Brother."
...What?
Did I hear that right?
"Why did the Duke save you back then?"
A clear voice startled me. I opened my eyes wide and looked out the window.
"Why? Are you going to be friends with the Duke?"
Oh, wow.
What's this little jerk doing here?
