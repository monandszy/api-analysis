## The Pilgrim (2)
Four adult males, each with stats better than mine. 
Truthfully, I'd always relied on stats and skills to take down monsters and raiders, so I felt a pang of worry.  But ultimately, it was unnecessary. 
"This is… easier than I thought?"
If it was hand-to-hand combat against four, I might be concerned. But with a proper weapon and shield, the numerical disadvantage wasn't a major problem. I could see everything clearly.
Well, I guess it's natural, considering I grew up fighting alongside Amelia, a monster in her own right, since my novice days.
*Clack!*
When the enemy attacked, I deflected with my shield.  Then, I repeatedly hammered down with my mace, striking their exposed gaps as they swung their weapons.
*Thud-!
I slammed my mace into one soldier's skull, leaving only one remaining.
“…P, Please, I don’t want to die.”
The young soldier, who had remained safely in the rear throughout the fight, felt defeat approaching and turned to flee.  
He was disrespecting his fallen friends, the audacity. 
I gripped my shield like a boomerang and flung it forward with all my might.
*Whoosh-*
The skill name was Shield Arrow.  I practiced it relentlessly during my novice days, longing for a ranged attack, but it ended up being a neglected skill.
*Thwack-*
The soldier, struck on the back of the head by the shield, crumpled forward.  I quickly approached and captured him.
“Let go, let go! Release me…!”
The soldier, panicked, thrashed wildly.
“I have a question.”
“I doubt you… *cough*!”
I landed a punch on his solar plexus, calming his agitated state.
“*Cough, cough, choke*…!”
The situation had stabilized enough for a conversation.  
I began to extract information from the soldier.  First, what I was most curious about.
“Where is this place?”
“What… do you mean…?”
What does he mean? 
I'm genuinely asking because I don't know.
“Just answer me. Where is this place?”
“…The Pilgrim’s Cave.”
Hmm, it looks like a crystal cave, but whatever.
“Then, what is your objective?”
“To capture all the escaped Pilgrims and bring them to the—.”
“Don’t shout. It hurts my ears.”
I continued to fire questions rapidly, clearing up my doubts and transforming vague information into concrete facts. 
I gathered a fair amount of information.
Information 10:  There are other Pilgrims besides me. 
The total number, including myself, is four. 
It seems Erwin, Vercile, and Ainar are all in similar situations…
Information 11:  The Pilgrims’ goal is to activate the Witch’s Altar hidden in the cave.
That definitely sounds like the clear condition.
Even if it’s not the clear condition, going there will at least lead me to my allies.
‘I guess just taking out one soldier gets you all the info. They’ll find their way here.’
Ah, of course, knowing where the Witch’s Altar is is a whole other problem.
But I had a hunch. 
The place where we conducted the raid, the very place we’re in right now.
The central dark zone.
The cavern with Gabriellius’s memorial, the first person to set foot in this maze. 
If there’s something hidden in this cave, it’s gotta be there.
‘…There’s no way they’d make us start from the outer area.’
I have a rough idea of the concept for this event. 
The Rock Desert, the Goblin Forest, the Beast’s Lair, the Land of the Dead.
Four characters starting from the entrances connected to the original second-floor field, each facing their own trials and converging at the central area.
‘They’ll probably make us have a boss fight there, or it’ll be a stepping stone to the next phase.’
Speaking of which, what triggered this event?
Just because there were four people in the raid?
No, that can’t be right.
There have been plenty of times when one character died mid-raid and four of us hunted the Lord of Terror.
‘…I’ll worry about the conditions later. For now, let’s focus on conquering this.’
I finished my interrogation and left the place.
***
First try.  
For any hardcore gamer, there’s no moment as exciting and thrilling as that first try, and I’ve always been one.
But…
*Thud.*
That was only true when it was a game.
In reality, things are entirely different.
*Thump, thump, thump.*
Every moment is filled with fear and vigilance.
The thrilling excitement is gone, leaving behind only a chilling sense of tension and one thought that keeps replaying in my mind.
‘I absolutely cannot make a mistake.’
I have to succeed flawlessly on the first attempt.
This isn't a roguelike where you learn by dying.
There are no second chances here.
“Character has slain ten Imperial soldiers.”
“All stats have increased by +1.”
“Character has slain fifteen Imperial soldiers.”
“All stats have increased by +1.”
“Character has slain twenty Imperial soldiers.”
“All stats have increased by +1….”
I started hunting down any soldiers I encountered, focusing on groups of five or fewer, and I could feel my stats slowly increasing.
‘Is it every five soldiers I slay…?’
I don’t know the exact amount each stat increases, but it seems so.
‘I don’t know how the boss will be, but I need to grow as much as possible.’
My heart craved to focus on hunting and boosting my stats, but my priority was moving towards the central area, not hunting.
It was a rational, calculated decision.
‘In this type of format, there’s a chance of a time-based penalty.’
A chance to become stronger and ample time.
This game isn’t kind enough to give you both. 
Not the [Dungeon and Stone] I’ve always enjoyed.
‘…If I have time left, I can hunt then. Let’s move.’
Focusing more on moving than hunting, I made my way towards the central area.  How long had it been? 
‘…At least seven hours have passed.’
Information was updated.
Information 12:  Just because the maze is closing doesn’t mean I can escape.
Even if the maze closed, it should’ve closed already.
I’m still here.
Of course, this caused some anxiety.
‘…Unlike rifts, I’m not trapped if I don’t escape within a certain time, right?’
It’s a variable I can’t ignore.
However, worrying about it now won’t change anyth—
“Pilgrim!”
A shout came from the passage beyond the side path.
How did they know?  We weren’t even in sight yet.
I hastily prepared for battle, but no soldiers emerged from the side path.
Instead, I heard their footsteps fading in the distance.
“Catch him!”
“Filthy witch’s disciple!”
I finally understood the situation.
Someone else was near me.
*Thump, thump, thump.*
I didn’t need to see anything else.  I followed the direction the soldiers ran. 
‘Ainar? Vercile? Erwin? Who is it?’
As I pondered who was being pursued by the soldiers, I saw in the distance soldiers gathering.
‘…They’ve gathered all the nearby soldiers.’
Nine soldiers blocking all three passages.
And Vercile Goul랜드 surrounded by them.
“O, O-Oh, don’t come! Please, don’t come!”
Vercile trembled as he swung his bone wand.
From a warrior’s perspective, I wondered if he even intended to hit anything.
Of course, the soldiers didn’t budge.
“Don’t stand there! Get him!”
“*Gah, gah, gack*!”
Vercile couldn’t even put up a proper fight and was subdued by the soldiers.
‘How did he even get this far?’
I had no idea, but I didn’t have time to ponder such things.
They were about to kneel him and prepare to behead him.
‘Immediate execution is the rule, I guess.’
‘Damn it, nine is a bit tough.’
Unfortunately, I had no choice.
I couldn’t just watch Vercile die.
*Thwack*
I slammed my mace into the soldier’s head, the one at the very back.
“…Surprise attack!”
Everyone’s eyes were on me.
Well, I don’t need to be stealthy anymore.
“Behel—laaaa!!!”
I charged forward, using my shield as ballast.
There was no other option.
“Get him! Get him first!”
How am I supposed to rescue her by taking them out one by one?
“*Ugh, eek*!”
I surged forward, leveraging my enhanced stats to push aside two soldiers.
I reached the center area. 
And when I embraced Vercile, who was kneeling.
*Pff!
A longsword pierced deep into my side.
“Hey, Yandell?”
“…Save the greetings for later.”
The path I came from was blocked once more by soldiers who had been knocked down and gotten back up.
I needed to reposition myself first.
My physical resistance wasn’t that high.  In this kind of situation, where I’m surrounded from front to back and sides, there’s no chance of winning.
“Hold on tight.”
“What? A-Aack!”
I had Vercile grip my neck and hang on, then retreated the way I came.
I pushed aside one of the soldiers with a shield bash.
*Thump, thump.*
As I tried to escape, I felt a sharp pain in my thigh.
*Pff!*
Damn it, a spear-wielding bastard.
I crushed the spearhead lodged in my thigh with my mace and continued my dash.
Thankfully, I managed to rescue Vercile and break the siege.
However, the problem was…
‘I can’t escape with this leg.’
Well, I’m safe from behind at least.
I hurriedly set Vercile down and sent her ahead.
Soldiers were slowly approaching from the corridor.
‘The structure of this passage means only three can attack at a time.’
And there were eight soldiers remaining.
‘…Not good.’
I was injured, a gash on my side and another on my thigh.
If this battle drags on, other soldiers might hear the commotion and gather here.
*Clank.*
As I braced myself for a difficult battle, lowering my center of gravity, I got a notification.
“Vercile Goul랜드 has cast [Surging Flesh].”
…The healing started.
***
[Surging Flesh].
An active skill of the 7th-tier monster, Dark Worshiper.
Vercile Goul랜드 cast it.
‘…What the hell is this?’
A mage using a core skill?
I’ve never seen this kind of phenomenon in [Dungeon and Stone].
But I had more important things to do than satiate my curiosity.
‘This changes everything.’
There was only one thing I needed to ask Vercile right now.
Not how she was able to use it.
“Vercile, how many more times can you use this ability?”
“Three minutes before I can use it again.”
“Good.”
My injuries had already healed completely.
Even if I got hurt again, I had a way to heal in three minutes.
This meant I could engage in much more aggressive combat.
*Thump, thump.*
I threw aside my defensive stance and charged forward, swinging my mace. 
And…
*Thwack, thwack-*
While I did suffer a few minor injuries due to the increased aggression, I ultimately won the battle.
“Character has slain seventy Imperial soldiers.”
“All stats have increased by +1.”
I took out seven soldiers, and the remaining two fled.
I didn’t bother pursuing them.
“Hey, Yandell…”
“…Let’s relocate first. Before those who fled call for reinforcements.”
“Ah, yes!”
I quickly looted the battlefield, collecting only a single suit of armor and shield that fit Vercile. 
And…
“Vercile Goul랜드 has cast [Surging Flesh].”
I secured a safe place, got healed first, and then began the conversation.
“What is this? How are you using an ability?”
“I don’t know either. I can use it naturally since I woke up. It’s incredible, like I gained a new organ in my body. I’m probably the first mage to experience this, right?”
Well, I don’t need a long explanation.
Before she could elaborate, Vercile cleared her throat and stopped.
“Ah, anyway, that’s not important. I have another ability I can use.”
“What is it?”
“I think it’s [Camouflage].”
[Camouflage] was a skill of the dwarves. 
It created a 3-meter invisibility barrier.
It seems Vercile used it extensively to get this far…
‘Maybe mages get balanced by having core skills infused into them?’
Yeah, that’s probably it.
A mage with no combat experience needs a balance patch if they want to survive.
“It was a real crisis. My soul power was lacking? So I was resting when I ran into the soldiers… I couldn’t even use invisibility after they saw me.”
“Where did you start from?”
“…What?”
“You should know if you looked outside before your barrier went down.”
“Oh, I’m sorry. I was too flustered and ran away immediately. I didn’t even check.”
“Ah, is that so? Well, I guess that can happen. It’s not really important anyway. Speaking of which, how did you figure out we need to go to the center area?”
“What?”
“…Huh?”
Vercile and I tilted our heads in unison, with a slight time difference.
“You… didn’t come here intentionally, did you?”
“This… is the center area…?”
“….”
So, he just ran here.
Thank goodness I was the one he ran into.
“…So what happened to Yandell? You beat ten soldiers. What’s your equipment? I didn’t even recognize you at first!”
After she finished talking, Vercile bombarded me with questions.
I told him the story so far, sharing information.
It began 0 minutes after I woke up.
I checked for skill seals, stat seals, and missing equipment.
Before the barrier broke, I overheard the soldiers talking, revealing that we were ‘Pilgrims.’
Also, the area outside the barrier resembled the Goblin Forest, so I thought my allies might’ve started from the opposite location…
I noticed the soldiers used ‘language,’ so I decided to extract information through interrogation.
And I fled.
20 minutes in.
I noticed the beasts helping us. 
I observed the soldiers fighting the beasts who were chasing me, allowing me to assess their level.
I also discovered they saw this cave as a dark place.
30 minutes in.
I decided to gather information.  I hid behind the brightest crystal and launched a surprise attack.
I won the three-on-one battle and looted their equipment, enhancing my combat power.
45 minutes in.
I used the Imperial armor set and ambushed them. 
I won the battle and interrogated them. 
I acquired a lot of information then, and the fact that the Pilgrims’ goal is to activate the Witch’s Altar hidden in the cave solidified my objective.
2 hours in.
I focused on moving, slaying every soldier I encountered to increase my stats.  I was worried about the variables that might arise if I spent too much time.
And…
Around 7 hours in.
“This is it. Got it?”
Okay, that about sums up our information sharing session.
“Alright, let’s move. We need to head to the center area. The Witch’s Altar is likely there.”
Vercile didn’t move at my command.
She just stood there, staring at me blankly.
“…Did you… know about this situation beforehand, Yandell?”
“Huh?”
What is she talking about?
If I did, this wouldn’t have happened.
“Of course I didn’t.”
“But how did you know all that…?”
It was a ridiculous question.
‘…Is he a player, too?’
Why is he so surprised by such a simple conclusion?
