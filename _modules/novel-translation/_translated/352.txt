## The Dark Continent (3)
Raven's "bullying" ended when they reached their destination after a fortnight of sailing. A vast plain stretched out before them, an inky purple barrier guarding the land's edge, as if to forbid any intruders. And before it, in the sea, a portal shimmered.
"Woooooo!"
"We made it!"
As soon as the long-awaited sight unfolded beyond the horizon, the explorers gathered on the deck erupted in cheers.  It had been a tedious voyage, after all.  Raven, usually healthy, had spent the journey sightseeing, while most others succumbed to seasickness, their minds devoid of boredom.
"Lihen Shweitz."  As Erwin stood beside Raven, she added a warning, "Just be careful."  Erwin hung her head, seemingly recognizing her mistake. Would she be able to avoid future slip-ups after this?
"So, why did you come? It looks like it'll take some time to get to the portal."
"Just… because I wanted to be with you…"
Initially, Raven had felt immensely burdened by Erwin's direct statements, but the pressure had lessened over time.  Or perhaps, she had simply grown accustomed to them?
"But what's that ship? I don't remember seeing it when we set sail."
Raven pointed with a finger.
The arrival portal was already packed with ships. Among them were several vessels unlike the freighter they had come on. 
"Oh, that? Those are speedboats. Usually, they take the people who reach the sixth floor fastest, and send them ahead."
"To prevent the Noirarc from coming down?"
"Yes.  It's happened more often lately.  Since the boat has no signs of battle, it seems they haven't tried anything this time…  But a while back, more than half of the speedboats were completely destroyed. It was intense, they say."
Raven nodded, understanding.  If they were the first to arrive, they must have defeated the so-called gatekeeper, the monster guarding the portal.  Did they obtain the essence?
Raven watched the commotion, a new wave of attention from the surrounding explorers washing over her.  It was a change brought about by the length of the journey.
"That woman is the Blood Spirit…."
"But who's the man beside her?"
"I asked a friend in the Magic Corps, and he said this was his first expedition. Apparently, he retired a few years ago and has returned."
"Hmm. And he's become an associate of one of the Seven Strong…  Perhaps there's more to him than meets the eye."
Thanks to Erwin's fame, both Raven and Amelia found themselves the subject of constant scrutiny wherever they went. 
Most of the gazes were fueled by curiosity – 99%, to be precise.  They were used to new faces appearing in every war, but these were the first to be seen with the Blood Spirit from the beginning.  They were curious about their identities and abilities.
The remaining 1% was animosity.
"Shweitz."
"Ah, Raven, are you talking about Raven?"
"She's at it again, staring from afar."
Even as Raven talked with the Corps members about the upcoming expedition, her gaze was fixed on Raven and Amelia.
"I…  should I take care of her later…?"
What was Erwin saying?
Raven smacked Erwin's forehead, as if to tell her to stop talking nonsense.  Erwin looked at her with an indignant expression.
"But what if she notices me? I'm scared."
Raven had actually considered this matter – not whether or not to "deal with" Raven, but whether or not to reveal her true identity and ask for her cooperation.  However…
"It's still too much trouble."
First, I would have to convince Raven that I wasn't an Evil Spirit, and even if I did, there was no guarantee that Raven would keep it secret and cooperate.  Raven was someone with a kind heart, but she also understood the importance of separating work from personal life.
"Even if I keep it a secret, she's currently serving the Royal Family.  If it ever came out, it could cause problems for me later."
Ultimately, Raven decided it would be best to reveal her true identity only after everything was settled.  However…
"If she finds out, then I'll have to come clean."
No matter what Raven hoped for, if I was discovered before then, I would have no choice but to ask for Raven's help—
"...But then it'll be so much harder."
Was that what was making her uneasy?
***
Woooooooo!
As the ship in the lead honked its horn, their vessel also descended into chaos.
"To your assigned positions!"
The waiting was finally over.  It was time to head for the battlefield.  The Royal Family's people issued orders, and the explorers who were watching on the deck moved to their assigned positions.
Of course, they didn't need to move.  Their assigned positions were already on the deck.
"Uncle… I mean, Lihen, let me tie you up!"
"Huh?"
"I'm good at this kind of thing!"
They were immediately tied to the ship with ropes supplied for the occasion – a precaution against falling overboard.  Once their preparations were complete, the horn in the lead echoed again, and their ship began to move.
"This is a bit nerve-wracking…"
"Don't worry.  Lihen… I'll protect you."
Wait, wasn't that supposed to be the tank's line?
Raven thought this, but didn't bother to continue the conversation.
"Lead ship entering the portal!"
As the ships in the lead passed through the portal, Raven felt her body heat up as their ship approached it.
After all, they were heading towards the battlefield.
Not only Raven, but the other explorers were also all stiff and grim, their faces starkly different from before.
Ugh.  Seeing everyone like this is giving me PTSD from that time on the first floor.
"Main force entering the portal!"
It was time to let go of her carefree attitude.  This was the seventh floor, a place she had never entered with her current body.  And it was a place teeming with explorers who were more dangerous than monsters.
Even if she was heading there to obtain something. 
She could just as easily return after losing something.
"Erwin, and Amelia."
"Yes."
"Listen."
One hand gripped the railing, while the other clutched the new shield she had bought a while back.  "Don't leave my side."
Flash!
Their ship plunged into the portal.
***
Woom!
The large freighter, which seemed to have been thrown by a giant, crashed into the water, creating a spray of water.  It was a fascinating experience, but there was no time to be distracted.
They weren't in a peaceful sea under a blue sky anymore.
"You've entered the seventh floor, the Dark Continent."
The sea, dyed black as if covered in oil.  Despite being only at the beginning of the continent, the surrounding fog was already obstructing their vision. 
And…
Kwang! Kwang! Pewoong-!
Loud explosions erupted from all directions, assaulting their eardrums.  It was the magic cannons fired by the Noirarc forces stationed atop the gorge.
"The welcome greetings are extra fiery today."
"Where in the world did those bastards get magic cannons from?"
"They must have taken them from our ship, I guess."
Even as they spoke, magic cannons, dark magic, and various other abilities were fired at their ship.  It was clear that the Noirarc were using considerable firepower, but the Royal Family's fleet was completely unscathed.  After all, there was nothing money couldn't solve.
Swaaaa-!!
A defensive magic circle activated upon entering the seventh floor, completely blocking the incoming attacks.
Their ship might have been shaken by the impact occasionally, but it wouldn't be destroyed.  The Royal Family had implemented a new policy for all their warships after suffering heavy losses during their initial landings – a major investment.
They say that maintaining this magic circle alone consumes tens of millions of stones per minute? 
"At this rate, how much money will it cost to get to the continent…  Ah, but it's cheap compared to the price of the ship."
Raven knew she shouldn't be concerned with the state coffers, so she pushed away the extraneous thoughts and focused on the present.
The fleet, having braved the relentless greetings, eventually broke through the nearby shoreline. Now they were changing formation, lining up in a single file to enter the narrow gorge.
"The character has entered a special area."
"Field effect – Gorge of Ghouls has been applied."
"All healing and regeneration effects have been disabled."
"Divine power has been sealed."
The Gorge of Ghouls.  A compulsory passage they had to go through to enter the Dark Continent, where all the coastlines were cliffs.
As their warship entered the gorge after the ship in front, the fog, thick with a sinister, gloomy feel, became even denser.
And…
"Prepare for combat!"
Undead-type monsters started to climb the exterior of the ship.
They were as diverse in their types as they were in their ranks.
"Deadburn defeated. EXP +3"
"Red Eye defeated. EXP +4"
"Banshee Queen defeated. EXP +6"
"Teeth Skeleton defeated. EXP +4"
"Cliff Ghost defeated…"
More than half of the monsters that appeared were ones they could also hunt on the sixth floor.  Since they skipped that stage, however, they earned experience quickly, no matter what they hunted.  Erwin was a huge help with her long-range attacks.  Nearly 70% of the monsters had been knocked off the ship before they could even board.
The sea monsters couldn't even attack.
"Chaos Seeman defeated. EXP +6"
"Malth Elephant defeated. EXP +5"
"Skeleton Mermaid Queen defeated…"
Thanks to the binding magic Erwin had cast, I earned experience just by landing a single hit.
Of course, they weren't just leeching off the situation.
Pewoong-!
Since there were plenty of specter-type monsters that didn't need to climb the ship, Raven had to constantly swing her weapon, never getting a moment's rest.
"Gostize defeated. EXP +4"
"Soul Drinker defeated. EXP +6"
"Gorge Spectre defeated. EXP +3"
Ugh, there were so many people on the ship that the respawn rate was crazy. 
Even as they fought on the deck, those insidious Noirarc bastards were firing magic cannons from the gorge above.  They were powerless against the defensive magic circle, but…
"Aaaaaaaaaargh!"
From time to time, explorers who had been fighting on the swaying deck would fall overboard when their ropes snapped.
Moreover…
"What's going on? Why isn't the ship moving forward?"
"I heard a ship ahead sank!"
"Huh? Why did a perfectly good ship…"
"A Deadrect appeared and damaged the warship's magic circle."
The ever-updating battle report revealed that there were even cases of the magic circle breaking due to monsters, causing the entire ship to sink.
"Well, they're persistent in their attacks from above."
Even if they managed to destroy just one ship, it wouldn't be a loss.  If they kept attacking like this, the fleet would be forced to disable the defensive magic circle.  They would be forced to keep it active throughout their journey through the gorge, burning through their resources—
"Amelia, behind!"
As Raven shouted urgently, Amelia swung a roundhouse kick, smashing the skeleton that was attempting to ambush them from behind.
And…
"Don't thank me.  We're allies—"
"It's Emily."
"Huh?"
"I know this might be the last thing on your mind right now, but please be careful."
"Right…  I will…"
It was the same name she used in the past, but it didn't quite roll off the tongue.  Ugh.  Did I really have to blame Erwin for her slip-ups now?
"Uncle…  Look over there!"
"It's Lihen."
"Ah…  yes…  anyway, look! We're almost there!"
Raven looked where Erwin was pointing, but she could only see fog.  However…
"Field effect – Gorge of Ghouls has been disabled."
As time passed, the narrow gorge widened, revealing a vast lake.  A waterfall cascaded down from the cliff face, its water a blood-red color.  And…
"Whew! We're finally out!"
"Now I can finally take a breath."
The monsters that had been appearing non-stop vanished, and the Noirarc's bombardment came to an end.  It was a relief that they had cleared the first gate.
"So, the real challenge starts now…"
Raven swallowed, looking at the shoreline obscured by the fog.
"..."
"..."
It might have been my imagination.
But it felt like I could already smell blood.
