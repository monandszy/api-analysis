## Chapter 355: Isolation (2)
The corpse twitched, coming back to life. Its skin was a patchwork of red, on the verge of bursting, stitched together with crude, jagged seams.
“Could it be... the Corpse Collector…?”
Amelia’s whispered question drew a sigh from me. Of course, she’d thought the same thing I had. If you were talking about necromancers in Noahrk, there was only one who could pull off something like this.
“If they truly infiltrated with a small elite force, then that bastard would be the one.”
Avet Necrapeto.  A notorious criminal affiliated with Orculus, known by the moniker "Corpse Collector," and a specialist in multi-target combat.  My head throbbed at the mere thought.
“If he’s here, then Noahrk is dead serious.”
“Damn it, they said a rearguard attack was unheard of after that event, why does it have to happen the moment I arrive…”
I couldn’t help but mutter a few grumbling words, but complaining could wait.  I dashed forward and smashed the corpse’s skull with my hammer.  No need for the "Swing" skill.
*CRACK!*
The corpse exploded in a spray of gore and blood. Being a melee fighter, I’d inevitably have to take the brunt of it…
*Sizzle, sizzle, sizzle!*
Damn, it seems like he even mixed in some poison.  This really is him.
“Are you alright?”
“Don’t worry about it.  I’m fine.”
There was no need to use "Spiritual Infusion" for immunity.  The +120 poison resistance I gained from Bol-Herschan was more than enough to deal with simple skin contact.  Besides, it was just a bit itchy.
“More importantly, it seems like things are starting to heat up…”
As I muttered, lost in thought about how my predictions were proving true, my gaze fell upon Erwin, standing as still as a statue.
“Erwin, are you alright?”
“…Yes? What, what did you say?”
“I asked if you were alright.”
“Ah, yes, I’m… I’m fine.”
Erwin nodded, but her voice was still shaky.  She stared at the crushed corpse, eyes vacant.
“Corpse... Collector…”
Right. 
It hit me then. This was the man who had taken her sister’s life. It wasn’t the Annihilator who had killed Daria, but Avet was responsible for the circumstances that led to her demise.
A moment later, Erwin asked in a trembling voice.
“…Can we kill him?”
Kill him…?
I considered her question for a moment before answering.
“Perhaps.”
Yes, if we were lucky, killing him might be possible.  But…
“Still, we have to survive this first.”
I spoke with unwavering resolve.  Seeking revenge wouldn't be worth it if we lost something else in the process.
I wasn’t sure if she understood, but Erwin stared at me blankly for about five seconds. She gnawed on her lip and clenched her fists.
“…Okay. I’ll do what you said, mister.”
Damn, this makes me uncomfortable.  I moved towards Erwin and placed a hand on her shoulder.
I don’t know if this would be comforting…
“Erwin, don’t worry. I’m the type who makes sure to return any favors.”
“…?”
“It means I’ve never forgotten what they did to us.”
It started as a comfort, but every word came from my heart.
Dragon Slayer, Regal Bagos.
Corpse Collector, Avet Necrapeto.
Annihilator, Belbeb Ruinzenes.
I haven't forgotten their crimes.  I’m simply waiting for the right moment.  Yes, because…
“Just wait a little longer. It won’t be long.”
“…Yes.”
Okay, that should be enough to get her back on track.
“Emily, where did that guy go?”
I brushed off the blood on my arm and asked about Alex’s whereabouts.  Amelia replied.
“He went into the tent as soon as the corpse fell from above.”
Hmm, is he going to report to Raven?  But why hasn’t he come back yet?
In the midst of all this, more corpses kept falling—
“It really did turn out exactly as you said, didn’t it?”
Ah, they say if you speak of the tiger, it will appear.
As I turned around, I saw Raven emerging from the tent alongside Alex.  Her expression had darkened considerably in the short time we were apart.
“I should have spoken more forcefully to the command when they brushed it off.”
Don’t be so dramatic.  What’s with the sudden regret?  There’s no use dwelling on the past.
“But what do we do now?”
“The command just sent orders. Every unit is to assemble at the lake.  Seems like they’re planning to use the magic circle on the ship to hold out.”
“Assembly, not resistance.”
They’re probably playing it safe, they don’t know the enemy’s strength yet.
“So, we’re leaving right away?”
“No, we’ll be waiting here for a while. I contacted the mages within the Mage Corps, they’ll be coming here soon with the explorers.”
Right.  We’ll head to the lake once they’ve all gathered.  After that, we’ll get on the ship, activate the magic circle, and buy some time.  
A good plan?  I’m not sure.  But what else can we do?
“Report on the numbers.”
“Three confirmed deaths, and two missing!”
“Two missing…  We can’t stay here any longer because of two people who might be dead or alive.  We’re leaving now.”
We waited, dealing with the bodies, until the mages of the Corps arrived with their escorting explorers.  Time to head to the lake.
“Aruya Raven has cast the 7th rank support magic, [Neutralize].”
Melee explorers like me were assisted by mages and support explorers, carving a path through the horde.  The journey itself was uneventful.  For now, it was just corpses.  It was too much for the undead to hold back over a hundred melee explorers assisted by dozens of mages.
But as we were rapidly heading towards the lake…
*BOOM!*
The ground shook, as if a nuclear bomb had gone off.  And…
“Looks like the magic circle’s been damaged.”
The mist that had dispersed by magic began to coalesce once again, obscuring our vision.  
It did have one advantage, though. The alarm magic that was blaring like an emergency siren had also been destroyed.  At least it was quieter now.
“What are you all doing?  Keep moving!”
Raven soon used wind magic to clear the mist around us, and we continued our advance.  The crimson lake was now close enough to be seen by the naked eye, and mages began summoning small vessels, launching them onto the water.
Then it happened.
“Get on the boats in order—”
“Aaaaagh!”
A man’s scream echoed from behind us.
***
The agonized scream of an unknown man.  We hadn’t encountered a single casualty in our battle against the corpses, so this scream was particularly loud to our ears.
Was it because of that?
*Thud.*
Raven, who had been the first to board the ship, withdrew her leg, which had already half-stepped onto the vessel.  Then…
“…What’s going on?”
“I’m checking now.  It’s probably nothing, just keep going—”
“No, I need to know.  Alex, you stay here and take charge of the rest.”
Raven ordered the others onto the ship first.  It seemed she didn’t want to get on board without knowing what was happening.
Wow, this is what responsibility looks like in a military commander?  Raven is known for her good reputation within the Corps, and now I know why.  She’s a hardworking supervisor, and a trustworthy one at that.
But the problem was…
“What are you doing?  Why aren’t you coming with us?”
Our mission is to protect her at all costs.  We can’t get on the ship without her.
“…Where are you going?”
Raven replied to my question concisely.
“Back there.  Something doesn’t feel right.”
No, if something feels wrong, shouldn’t you run away?
That thought was running through my head when…
“Aaaaagh!”
Another scream erupted from behind us.
Then…
“Captain! The enemy’s identity has been confirmed!”
Finally, news from the rear arrived.  Surprisingly, there was only one attacker.  
But none of us underestimated the situation.  The attacker’s description was famous throughout the city.
“…A noble knight in crimson armor?”
“Yes.  He has been confirmed to be using aura.”
The Blood Knight.  Born in Bifon, he rose from a common soldier to become a knight, eventually assassinating the former Royal Knight Commander, which solidified his infamous reputation among Orculus criminals.
“Emily, do you know anything about him?”
While Raven spoke with her subordinate, I discreetly slipped away to the back and asked Amelia for information.  But there wasn’t anything useful.  She said she hadn’t interacted with him since he didn't venture outside much.  She had only seen him a few times in the Lordship, and even then, never exchanged a word.
“Captain……! You have to hurry and get on board while we hold them back!”
“No, if it really is the Blood Knight, the damage will be catastrophic.  Get on the ship first.”
“But…!”
“But what? If someone has to stay behind, it makes sense for it to be me.  Get on the ship, it’s an order.”
“…….”
“Yes!”
The mage, despite his concerned expression, saluted Raven with a grateful face.  It was a heartwarming sight, if we weren’t directly involved in this.
“So, Erwin, would you mind helping me out until the rest of the Corps has boarded the ship?”
After finishing with her subordinates, Raven earnestly pleaded with Erwin.
“We just need to buy some time.  Then I’ll use [Multi-Instantaneous Teleportation] to get us out.”
“Multi-instantaneous…?”
They can’t learn that magic, right?  I muttered under my breath, and Raven replied.  She didn’t even look at me, her eyes fixed on Erwin.
“I was lucky to learn it. If I had this back then… there might have been another way. Of course… it’s too late now.”
“…….”
“Please.”
Erwin glanced at me in response to Raven’s repeated plea, as if she was leaving the decision to me.
“Why him…?”
Raven looked at me with questioning eyes, confused by Erwin’s choice.
“I wouldn’t have imagined she’d go through with this act…”
Although she seemed to understand the situation, I only asked a single question to confirm, since time was of the essence.
“What if we don’t follow you?”
“I’d be court-martialed for disobeying orders. I’d never be allowed to participate in royal events again.”
A threat, maybe?  But that wasn’t what I was asking…
“I asked what you’d do. Regardless of the punishment, what if we choose not to follow you? Would you go alone?”
“Ah…”
Raven pondered for a moment before answering.
“I can’t do it alone. I’ll probably go with other explorers.”
Right, there are no other options.  She’s stubborn in the wrong way.  Then again, she always had a self-sacrificing side, didn’t she?
“Alright, let’s go together.”
There was no time to delay after that.  The rear wasn’t that far away.
As we arrived at the rear, the first thing we saw was a mage, kneeling helplessly in front of a menacing aura, completely vulnerable.
“Aruya Raven has cast the 4th rank support magic, [Orbital Interference].”
Instead of using a half-baked defense magic to block the aura, Raven cast a utility magic, altering the sword’s trajectory.
*Whoosh!*
The large sword, instead of aiming for his neck, grazed his head.
“Ugh…!”
I immediately dashed forward, grabbing the panicked mage to pull him out of harm’s way.
“Thank, thank you… Cap, Captain?!”
“Raymond, you did well.  Leave the back to us, and lead the explorers to join the main force.  It’s an order.”
“Yes!”
As the mage obeyed Raven’s orders and led the explorers away, our opponent simply watched us from afar, with an unnerving gaze.
“This is the Blood Knight…”
I stood at the front, shielding my upper body with my shield.  I scanned him from head to toe.  
First impressions?  He’s shorter than I expected.  He’s definitely around 5 feet 4 inches, but…  I don’t feel like he’s weak.
“What’s with this guy’s aura?”
He had a solid build, evident from his bone structure.  Combined with his innate charisma, he exuded an imposing presence, even with his smaller frame.  
But the most intimidating factor was his voice.
“The Golden Mage, Aruya Raven.”
It wasn’t just a metallic sound, his voice was definitely damaged, almost as if his vocal cords had been broken.  In that voice, he spoke slowly.
“One of the targets… to be eliminated.”
He raised his large sword with a professional air, as if it was just a job.
We’re not even worth a glance to him?
Seeing the crimson aura, the hallmark of a Blood Knight, I muttered under my breath.
“Erwin, use [Spiritual Infusion].”
“What kind?”
What kind?  What else would we use against a knight?
“Rock.”
The moment I answered, Erwin’s body turned translucent.  And the instant our hands clasped…
“The spirit of the earth has taken residence in the character’s body.”
I felt the earth’s power coursing through my skin.
“Damage received from fire element reduced by half.”
“Damage received from water element doubled.”
“Poison resistance bonus.”
“Increased effectiveness of destruction actions when using blunt weapons.”
“Massive increase in physical resistance… ”
“…”
Ah, it’s been a while since I’ve been in Earth Mode.
“Character’s physical resistance exceeds 350.”
“Damage from piercing attacks reduced by 50%.”
At this point, even without [Gigantification], my second-stage skin should be active…
“Pointless actions… you are taking.”
Oh, he’s overconfident just because he can use aura.  We'll see how much he enjoys facing a tank.
“Die, ugh, wait.”
Seeing the old knight closing the distance, I grinned.  
Who’s going to die?  I came all this way, for what?
“Character has cast [Iron Fortress].”
“The effects of [Evolved Skin] have been increased by 1.5 times.”
“Knight Crusher,”  my former nickname.  Finally, it’s time for it to shine.
