## Chapter 622: Triumphant Return (5)
The activation of Parav's Golden Goblin Charm signified one thing: a turning point. A perilous event was about to unfold, and this was the only chance to avoid the impending misfortune. 
In that context, I wondered if the Director's words had been true.  A little over a month remained before the half-year deadline the Director had warned me about. Considering the travel time to the Chieftain's Island, this was the final line. 
The crucial point was...
"My Lord, shouldn't we leave right away? No, we have to leave!"
"Calm down and return to your post. I will handle this situation."
"What? But… yes! You need to act quickly, as quickly as possible!"
This was a fellow who had always been a model subordinate, yet his urgency spoke volumes about the intensity of his premonition.  He claimed this feeling was even stronger than when we were taken to the Icerocks. 
I couldn't help but feel a sense of urgency myself.  After all, how many of us had succumbed to the icy depths during that expedition?  I didn't want to experience that again.
"Deputy Commander, I will be back shortly."
"...So suddenly?"
"I might have to leave this place urgently.  I will explain everything when I return, so for now, command the operations in my absence."
I instructed the Deputy Commander to continue the raid without me, and to prepare for our departure if possible.  Then, I rushed towards the control room at the top. 
"Is this the right decision?"
Doubt gnawed at me as I walked. If I accepted the Director's offer and received the qualification, leaving the island and setting sail, I could reach the Chieftain's Island within the deadline.  No one would get hurt. 
Even I couldn't argue with the safety of this plan.
"But I wouldn't want to leave this place."
The Director's reason for preventing my return was still a mystery, another factor in my indecision.  But...
"The Goblin said that, I can't just ignore it."
Was I truly caught in a dilemma?  My head was spinning.  However, I decided to simplify my thinking. 
Priorities.
Every decision starts with prioritizing what matters most.  As I headed to the control room, I introspected. 
My heart grew lighter, and I reached a decision.
"I'll take the deal."
I couldn't be sure what treasures lay hidden in the basement, but I had already gained enough.  After all, the basement was like a bonus stage, something I never even knew existed. 
Moreover...
"There's nothing more I can do here, at least for now."
If I wanted to find more hidden treasures, we would need a higher level of skill and resources.  This was the same with the giant on the Giant Island.  There were too many uncertainties. 
Just as countless lives were lost during our hunt for the rank 1 monster in the Library Island, more sacrifices would be inevitable if we continued.  Yes, that meant...
[You have arrived.]
"Yes, I have."
I cautiously entered the control room, a place I had not visited for almost a month.
[It seems you've finally made your decision.]
The Director appeared on the screen, seemingly aware of why I had returned.
"You're an odd one, aren't you?"
Surprisingly, the Director had been waiting ever since his initial offer. Despite months passing, he hadn't even urged me.  As if he already knew the outcome wouldn't change.
[Now, tell me. Your decision.]
I felt a pang of annoyance, knowing he had manipulated me.  But with the decision made, emotions were irrelevant. 
My choice affected more than just my safety. 
"Give me the qualification, whatever it is. I won't be back here again."
[A wise choice.]
"Stop it, just give it to me. Do I need to sign some contract or something?"
[There's no need for that.]
A luminous beam emerged from the monitor, bending to the side.
[The contract is already sealed.]
What was he talking about?  Already sealed? 
"Nothing has changed."
Just as I thought that, a notification appeared.
"Achievement Unlocked"
Condition:  7th Records Archive Progress 15% Achieved
Reward:  Permanent Access Granted to the Basement, Records Archive.
Swoosh-
A golden inscription shaped like a book appeared on my right hand, radiating light before dissolving into my skin.
Simultaneously, I felt a sensation I had never experienced before.  
Clank-
It felt as though something had gently grasped my heart.  But it was fleeting, vanishing without a trace, leaving me wondering if I had simply imagined it.
"...What did you do to me?"
[Nothing.  Just a pact was formed.]
"...A pact?"
[Think of it as a unique pact.  A new rule created within the Labyrinth, solely applicable to you and me, with mutual consent.]
In any case, the Director seemed to have no further interest in me now that the deal was done. 
[Well then, our business is concluded. You must be busy, so go now.  You'll have good news when you descend.]
"Good news...?"
[You'll find out when you go.]
Such a mystery to the very end.  The Director left me with a sense of being tricked, even in his farewell. 
[Marx, you too, farewell. I am truly happy to see you again, even if just for a short time.]
The Director then turned to Hamsik, who was on my shoulder.
[...No.]
[No? What do you mean?]
The Director asked, and Hamsik, after a moment of silence, replied clearly.
[It's not Marx, it's Hamsik.]
[...As I told you before, that name was given by the witch. It held immense significance for you—]
[That was me before losing my memories.]
The Director, taken aback by Hamsik's audacity, remained silent for a while before finally speaking.
[True, even in this world, there's no such thing as eternal—... You have changed too.  So have I.]
His voice was still mechanical, but I sensed a flicker of emotion.  It was like a memory, or maybe nostalgia. 
[If that's your choice, then so be it. I wish you good luck.]
The Director said no more, and I left the control room with Hamsik on my shoulder.
[Hey, are you okay?]
Hamsik asked worriedly as we stepped outside.
[That pact. Are you sure it's alright?]
"How would I know? Well, I can't see any problems right now."
[You know I went to the control room every day to talk to him while you were gone? Be careful. That guy is definitely suspicious.]
"I will. Thanks for worrying."
[...It's what friends do.]
The word "friend" made me close my mouth shut.  It's because I learned from the Director while I was trying to get information from him every day. 
Hamsik couldn't leave the basement.
And...
"Now I can't go down there either."
We both knew this, but we never brought it up.  As if it didn't exist. 
***
As soon as we reached the underground factory, I knew.  The Director's "good news" was this. 
"Sir! Come quickly! Hurry!"
"Could that be… from that guy?"
"Yes! Congratulations! You wanted it, didn't you?"
An essence had dropped during my trip to the control room.  And it was the green essence I had been hoping for.  
Raven, who caught my gaze as I approached with a blank expression, shrugged her shoulders. 
"I was going to put it in a vial if you didn't come back soon, but I'm glad you arrived just in time."
"How long has it been?"
"Ten minutes."
Right, that's right.  Seeing that I still had some time, I removed all my numbered items. 
This essence needed some preparation before I could consume it.
Thump, thump.
After finishing the preparations, I slowly approached the essence.  Having reached level 8, I had one empty slot after consuming the Bellarios essence.  
If I could consume it without using a vial, then consuming it right here would be ideal.
However, the problem was...
"Will it work?"
In "Dungeon & Stone," essence duplication was impossible.  Of course, you could consume a regular essence and then consume a Guardian essence.
"In those cases, the regular essence would simply upgrade to a Guardian essence."
So what would happen in this case?
The answer came soon. 
Swoosh.
The moment my fingertips brushed against the essence floating in the air...
"I guess it doesn't work this way."
My outstretched hand passed right through the essence. As if there was no room left in my soul.
"Tsk."
Honestly, I had expected it.  If essence duplication was possible, I could've experimented with it.  
Could identical skills be used multiple times?
"It's a shame."
To use [Enlargement] and [Transcendence] to achieve 'Super Enlargement,' and then use [Enlargement] again...
'That would've been amazing.'
"So this essence will have to be consumed after I leave, erasing the original one…"
Raven finished storing the essence in a vial, and I banished all thoughts about it.
"Deputy Commander, are you ready to leave?"
"Yes, we can depart immediately."
"Then that's good. Let's go, back home."
It was time to leave. 
***
We left the research institute and headed towards a specific location, passing through the forest.  After traveling for a few days, we arrived at a vast lake.  It was a place we had discovered, or rather, opened up during our previous expedition.
Well, it was originally blocked by a barrier, but we destroyed the giant drone in front of it, making it accessible.
"All hands aboard! Head to your assigned positions!"
By the way, launching a boat on this lake was the way to escape this Rainbow Island.  
Well, this was the first time we were actually implementing it.  But since the Director had explicitly said so, it shouldn't be wrong. 
Tick-tock.
I activated the pocket watch obtained from the destroyed giant drone and waited until the second hand completed a full circle.  Just like when we arrived here, dazzling rainbow light enveloped the lake.
Flash-!
When I regained consciousness, we were back in the windless zone where we had endured the rainy season.  I went straight to the Library Island and dropped off Hamsik.
"I'm sorry. I broke my promise.  I said I would help you recover your memories."
[...Are you still thinking about that? Don't make that face. I already heard everything I needed from the Director.]
"..."
[Farewell.]
Hamsik didn't say anything implying a reunion, only a farewell greeting.  So, I just said it.
[...See you again...? ]
"Yes, you never know what the future holds.  I'll find a way to return, no matter what."
[Is that even possible...? ]
"I believe it is. That's why I accepted the Director's proposal."
[...Hmph, then come back if you can.]
"Take care.  Don't open the door to strangers."
I didn't have much time, so after bidding farewell to Hamsik, I immediately headed towards the Chieftain's Island.  
Thanks to the constant full speed sailing, we reached the Chieftain's Island three days before the deadline the Director mentioned.
"The island! The island!"
After disembarking, I rushed to the Dimensional Monument in the village, just in case. 
"Po, Portal! The portal is open!"
"Can, can we finally go back now?!"
"Baron Yandell, forever! Forever!"
Luckily, the Director's promise was true.  The Dimensional Monument, which had always remained silent, activated, creating a blue portal.
However, I didn't immediately step through. 
Because I was curious.
[If you don't leave this place within half a year, you'll face great danger.  It's the time when 'that person' will appear.]
Who was 'that person' the Director spoke of?  He hadn't given me any information until the very end, making me even more curious.
"The portal is open.  I'll check the situation and leave."
I left the main force in the village and went inland with Sven Parav.
"I, why am I..."
"Focus.  We need to leave immediately if you sense danger."
"If that's the case, I want to go back right away, but... isn't the rainy season starting soon anyway?!"
"You're still at ease, judging by your words."
"..."
A day and two days passed.  Only a couple of hours remained until the date the Director mentioned. 
Swoosh-
A strong wind suddenly blew from behind me, as if something was about to begin.
"I, I think we should leave now."
"Are you very uneasy?"
"Yes...."
"Let's just check one thing quickly."
I hurried to the cliff edge and looked towards the coast. The silver sea was violently churning, as if some force was pulling it away.
"We should hurry back! I'm getting really uneasy...."
Seeing that, I thought this was really the last few hours...  
I checked the map one last time. 
"That's the direction of the rock island."
The wind blew, and the waves followed.  In that direction lay the rock island. 
[If you encounter waves while sailing, stop immediately and find shelter.]
Was it the one mentioned in the Chieftain's Rumor Diary?  I couldn't tell. But it was time to take Sven Parav back to the village.
One by one, I transported everyone through the portal.  
And I was the last one.  
Since I created the portal, it might close when I disappear....
Wooooom-!
Right when I was about to enter, the entire village shook as if an earthquake had hit. 
"What is this?"
My gamer curiosity flared up, but I decided not to go outside and check.  
Yes, if I can return here someday, maybe I'll find out then.  
If not, there's no need to know. 
"The Monarch of Records, Recardo, begins his patrol of the layer."
Let's just ignore it and leave. 
Whoooom-!
I stepped into the portal. 
The entire Labyrinth, including the first floor Crystal Cavern, closes when the rainy season starts. 
"But I'm glad the portal is open."
The portal was open. 
So where would this portal take me? 
I expected it to take me back to the first floor, but the Labyrinth is already closed.
My question was answered soon.
"The character has been transported to Rafdonia."
If the Labyrinth is closed, then I'll return to the city.
Well, maybe it just automatically transports you to the city.  Anyway, it doesn't matter.
"Sir...."
The Dimensional Plaza in the 7th zone, the same place we entered the Labyrinth a long time ago. 
Looking around, I saw only the Clan Anabada members who had entered the Labyrinth with me standing in the empty plaza.
Of course, this wasn't unusual.  I heard the expedition force used the Dimensional Plaza in a different zone, and the same was true for the Armin Expedition Force and the Hext Clan.
Yes, everything was normal up until this point.  
I didn't even expect everyone to be waiting here, welcoming our return.
But...
"The, the plaza, why is it like this...."
The plaza we arrived at looked completely different from what I remembered.
Swoosh-
The wind carried a pungent smell, and the checkpoint building, where lines used to form, was completely destroyed and collapsed.  
As if a great war had just taken place.
"Something happened in the city while we were gone... it seems."
Amelia, who was calmly analyzing the situation, glanced around. 
And at that moment.
"Captain! Over here! Over here!"
A man's voice echoed from afar.
"A portal reaction was just detected..."
The man who had climbed onto the ruins of the checkpoint met our gaze.
"Huh? Who are you guys?"
I couldn't help but chuckle when I saw the emblem on his chest.
"Where did you guys come from?"
Where did we come from? 
That's what I wanted to ask.
'What in the world happened...?'
How could these Noark bastards be roaming the city so freely?
