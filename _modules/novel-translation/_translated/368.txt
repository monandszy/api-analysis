## Black Star (1)
Click, click. I navigated the mouse, checking the chat rooms first. It was one of the routines I followed every time I entered the community.
[For the Independence of Korea] - 0 members online.
This was the Korean chat room where I first met Baekho. As expected, there were no users online. 
‘Sigh, I wouldn’t mind meeting him and having a heart-to-heart conversation.’ 
I briefly checked the room and moved the screen to the free board. Usually, posts explode as soon as the community opens. There’s no better time to quickly get a grasp of events that happened in the past month.
[Breaking News] Viscount Lamreon’s death in this expedition.
-  It seems that the Orculus Guild Master and his four members took him down.
-  The vacant position of the 3rd Legion Commander is likely to go to the Chief of Staff, who served as an acting commander during the expedition.
[these99: Since the weaknesses of the [Golden Wall] have been revealed to the world, the rearguard won’t be a comfortable spot anymore.]
[└SecureId7: Comfortable spot? I saw how little they were damaged. It’ll just mean an increase in patrol forces.]
[stevencastle: Is that Chief of Staff Eltora Tercerion? The one with the damn noble’s son?]
[└Writer: Yes. The son of the Grand Vizier.]
[└stevencastle: Ugh, I’m never going to the 3rd Legion. I haven’t had a good experience with him.]
As expected, the most frequent posts were about the war.
[Anyone heard from the Blood Queen?]
-  I heard she took down the Orculus member, the Lightkeeper, during this expedition. Is it confirmed?  They say the Blood Queen’s forces included a Blood Knight, a Corpse Collector, and the Wailing Witch.
[marcelone: It’s confirmed, everyone who needs to know already does.  Apparently she didn’t do it alone, but joined forces with the Golden Mage.]
[└Writer: Wow, really? They were comrades in the past. Guess their relationship isn’t as bad as rumors.]
[marcelone: Still, their opponents were too strong, so there’s a lot of speculation. It makes no sense that the Blood Queen, even with her title, could take down the Lightkeeper, who was a support position, against such a strong force.]
Tsk, so even here, some have doubts.  If they’re speculating this much here, others might be starting full-fledged investigations. 
Click, click.  I continued reading the posts, thinking about various things. 
And after what felt like an eternity, a notification arrived.
[Sender: Ghost Master]
The sender’s name was GM’s nickname, but it wasn’t surprising. System messages, announcements, and other official communications were sent under that name.  Over 90% of the messages in my inbox are from GM.  But…….
‘Because of my karma, I can’t help but feel tense.’
I clicked the message, feeling that it was inevitable.  And sure enough, the message was an invitation.
[I was too preoccupied last time, so I’m contacting you now. Let’s meet if you have time.]
An invitation from GM.
***
It wasn’t surprising. I had expected GM to contact me eventually. In fact, it was strange that it took this long.
‘Honestly, I thought I’d get contacted right after the last meeting.’
I revealed GM’s identity at the round table.  And through Soul Queen, this information would’ve reached GM as well.
‘But for them to contact me only in the next round…’
There were two possibilities. They wanted to take their time and carefully plan the meeting. Or, they couldn’t receive contact while the community was being activated.
Well, it wasn’t really important.
‘What should I do?’
I left the message open and pondered for a bit. Even if I declined the invitation, GM wouldn’t punish me with a ban. I diligently acted like a big shot, wearing the Lion Mask.
If they had any interest, they wouldn’t completely cut me off.  Especially after being banned by Baekho and nearly dying in the real world.
‘…Fine, I’ll meet them.’
Now that I’d decided, there was nothing to hesitate. I closed the message window and searched for the secret chat room mentioned in the message, entering the password.
‘Password is 0720? Is it some kind of anniversary?’
Even if it were true, it wasn’t something worth stressing over.
Swoosh-!
A flash of light erupted from the monitor, and when I opened my eyes, I was in a study with an antique interior.
“…..”
The faint scent of old books.  This place, with its calming atmosphere, felt somewhat familiar. I’d been here once before.
It was during the rumors about dimensional collapse. I was verifying whether the rumors were true, and I received information from a man here.
[Elfnunalove]
The man with that bizarre nickname above his head.  I never imagined he’d be the GM.
Well, I suppose it’s the same for him?
“It’s been a while, Elfnunna. Or should I call you Lion?  Which one do you prefer?”
“Either one’s fine.”
“Your speech patterns have changed a lot since then.  Or perhaps, this is your true form?”
I had no reason to answer their probing question, so I ignored it and sat down on the opposite sofa. The GM let out a forced smile.
“This is our third encounter, isn’t that strange?  The way people connect.”
Definitely strange.  The first time, I was a newbie looking for information in the community.  The second time, it was in the chat room with Baekho.
[Literally, I won’t be able to meet Baekho here anymore.]
The GM informed me of the situation regarding Baekho, out of a sense of duty, since I was from the same place as him. And that was that.  To them, I was just a rare Korean player, nothing more, nothing less.
“You’ve become quite silent since we last met.”
“…..”
“Let me ask directly. I don’t easily believe in connections. What do you want from me?”
What I want…?
“Why do you think I want something?”
“Even if not the second encounter, the first one was surely intentional.”
Yes, they interpreted it that way.  It was purely coincidental.
“You were the one who invited me to the chat room, even then.”
“Yes, I was. But, thinking about it now, it’s strange. The question post about the Tarutein School and the magician named Shernal Pergang… ”
“…..”
“No matter how I think about it, I can’t shake off the feeling that you were trying to lure me in.  You intentionally posted something that would pique my interest, didn’t you?”
They’re funny, aren’t they?  What do I gain from that?
“That thought makes me uneasy. It means you knew a lot about me.”
It was an absurd leap, but there was no point in denying it. So, I just ended the conversation there.
“…You didn’t invite me here just to talk about that, did you?”
“Are you avoiding answering my question?”
Avoiding?  I can’t tell them the truth.
“Think whatever you want.”
“I will.”
“So, why did you call me here?”
I bluntly changed the subject, and the GM chuckled, responding.
“A strange question.  Aren’t you the one who called me here?”
What? Why is the conversation going that way?
“…..”
I remained silent, facing the unknown direction, and the GM continued.
“I don’t know how you found out my real name. But you told Soul Queen my real name because you wanted to meet me, right?”
Well…….
When they say it so sharply, it makes me more uncomfortable.  I’m suddenly thinking a lot.
However, as always, the period of contemplation was short.
“Indeed.”
Now that things are like this…
“You’re not a fool.”
Let’s change the direction a bit. 
***
“So, you mean… ”
The GM trailed off, glancing at me. 
I just shrugged my shoulders in response.
“!”
They’re just probing, anyway.  I’m sure this is a tactic to get information by asking questions. 
If I admit it, it’ll be a fact check.  If I deny it, they’ll be able to rule out one possibility.  Essentially, it’s not a loss for them even if they’re wrong. 
So…….
‘Let’s make them completely wrong.’
I opened my mouth.
“Yes, I want something from you.”
Thinking about it, it’s not such a bad situation.  It’s not just idle chatter. Among things I want, there are some that only GM can do—
“Then you could’ve quietly contacted me.”
Ah, that…….
“That method wouldn’t be fun.”
I answered evasively, and the GM interpreted it as expected.
“…Well, I see it as you trying to threaten me.”
Whatever, it’s up to you to think what you want.  I got back to the main point.
“So, you won’t ask?”
“…What are you talking about?”
“What I want from you.”
“…..”
The GM stared at me silently for a moment, then let out a heavy sigh.
“Fine.  Tell me. What do you want from me that made you do this?”
I waited a moment before answering.
“Lift Baekho’s ban.”
If I need GM’s power, it’s only this.  If Baekho comes back to the community, I’ll be able to talk to him.  I need to get information about our cat, who’s currently under temporary protection.
But, was this a request they expected?
“…I see, so that was the purpose.”
GM was surprisingly calm.  Well, it’s not unusual for players to form factions based on their nationalities.
“Then did Baekho tell you about my identity?”
A question implying that Baekho and I are in cahoots.  There was no need to answer.
“Maybe.”
“What are you two scheming?”
“I have no reason to hide it.”
“What?”
The GM’s face froze in surprise.  People should listen to the end of the story.
“If it’s worth it.”
As I continued, the GM’s expression hardened.
“Are you… referring to the interesting information?”
Yes, that information reached them too.  I remained silent without denying, and the GM tapped their knee with their index finger….
“Ha, ha, ha……..”
They suddenly started laughing like a deflated balloon.  What? Suddenly scary.
“You’re quite confident, aren’t you?”
A cold question, a complete 180 from their previous polite and courteous demeanor.
“Not completely.”
“That’s like me.”
“Are you refusing?”
The GM answered without any hesitation.
“Yes. You spread my information without permission, making one-sided demands. I have no reason to comply.”
“…..”
“If you want to lift Baekho’s ban, bring something worthy.”
The GM stood up abruptly, looking at me as if asking if I had anything else to say.  Well, it’s good they gave me time to speak.
“I’m sorry.”
I spoke with sincere regret.
“You thought I was making a deal?”
The GM tilted their head.  They’re pretending not to understand.
I’ve been able to feel their fear of me ever since our first encounter.
[Your speech patterns have changed a lot.]
The GM maintained their courteous demeanor even after my rude speech.
[…Well, I see it as you trying to threaten me.]
They felt a huge threat from my actions.
[Then you could’ve quietly contacted me.]
They expressed regret about my past actions, rather than anger.
So…….
“I’ll give you three months.”
“…Are you threatening me?”
I didn’t affirm or deny.  As always, it’s up to the listener to interpret.
The GM then said, “Not even Baekho could do anything to me.”
Such a small voice, it sounds like they’re giving themselves courage.  Let’s make a correction.
“Technically, you almost died because of him.”
“…..”
“Do you think I’m as weak as him?”
“…..”
The GM didn’t answer.  So…….
“Remember, three months.”
“…..”
“After that, I’ll come to you.”
Now it’s my turn to get up.
***
“Whew…  I feel better now that I’m back.”
I left the chat room and returned to my computer room, collapsing onto the bed. 
I’ve been through this countless times after wearing the Lion Mask, but it’s still tiring every time. 
‘I never expected it to turn out this way.’
Originally, I planned to meet GM to find out how much they knew about me, and maybe get some information. If possible, I was going to bring up Baekho.
Yes, I definitely intended to do that, but……
‘I didn’t expect them to be so scared of me.’
Our conversation changed my perspective.  The Magitechnologist, Yrven Havelion.
A mysterious, powerful figure who knows his identity. It seems that that position was a source of considerable anxiety for them, and my ability to quickly recognize it worked in my favor.
‘But even after their identity was exposed, the Royal Family didn’t seem to be wary.’
However, as I slowly replayed our conversation, a question arose that I didn’t notice before. 
There was no need to harm me directly; they could just leak information about me being a demon to the Royal Family, which would be my guaranteed downfall.
Then why was the GM only worried about direct threats?
‘…Does he have some kind of backing from the Royal Family? Enough to cover up a demon problem?’
If so, I’d love to share some of that backing.  …No, that wouldn’t work.
‘That last part of our conversation is also a bit confusing.’
I recalled the question the GM had asked me before leaving the chat room.
[Password.  You haven’t said anything about the password.]
It was quite a disconcerting experience.  I mean, why the password? The way they asked made it seem like there was a hidden meaning, but…
[……]
I was completely clueless, so I kept quiet.  And it served as an answer to the GM.
[So, you really have no connection to him… ]
[……]
[Sorry for grabbing you.  See you soon.]
Ugh, making people feel uneasy…
‘0720… ’
What did GM want to confirm from me through that number?
