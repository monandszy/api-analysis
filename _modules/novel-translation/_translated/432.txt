## Chapter 432: The Lion's Return (3)
The countess's planned triumphal procession was straightforward.  The procession would begin in the dimensional plaza of Ravigion where we had returned, then proceed through the commercial city of Cummelby before finally reaching the imperial capital, Carnon.
*Baa-bum, Baa-bum, Baa-ba-ba-bum-*
The military band in their uniforms played a cheerful tune.
*Woooong-* *Woooong-* *Woooong-*
The carriage adorned with drums rolled out, emitting a majestic sound.
“Wooooooahhhh!”
Cheers and blessings from the people.
A sea of flower petals rained down in the middle of the road.
“This is the hero’s procession!”
Adorned with equipment as grand as those of legendary heroes, equipment that we wouldn’t dare use in actual combat.
“Wooooooahhhh!”
We marched onward, and onward.
The faces of the people watching us were all bright and cheerful.
“They say they shattered the Sky Eye, they’ve accomplished great feats.”
“This will give the royal family a significant advantage in the future.”
“It was the most challenging piece, after all.”
Explorers clapped their hands.
“Daddy, what’s the Sky Eye?”
“I don’t know for sure… but it seems to be a very important artifact.”
“I want to be like those people one day!”
“Well, you can achieve anything you set your mind to.”
A family with a young son on their shoulders had simply come out for the festival.
“Akuraba! There’s Akuraba over there!”
“I thought he retired, but to think I’d hear of him here.”
“Meland Kaislan!”
“Oh! The Bloodling countess is over there!”
Some were simply in the crowd hoping to catch a glimpse of the faces of famous people.
And then…
“Thanks to you all… my son can finally rest in peace! Truly, truly… thank you!”
A woman, her face drenched in tears, grabbed my hand as she rushed to the front of the carriage. Did she lose a family member to Noark?
Did these people realize?
That in the countess's original plan for the triumphal procession, only an empty coffin bearing our names would have been placed in the carriage.
*Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep-*
Too many people, perhaps I’m suffering from panic disorder.
My ears are ringing, and it’s becoming harder to force a smile.
It was during this time.
“Sir…”
Erwin, who was beside me, clasped my hand.
Kaislan, who was riding in the carriage in front, looked back at me with worried eyes.
Are they worried that someone might cause trouble?
“Wooooooahhhh…”
The procession, which had been traveling along the main road for a long time, passed through Ravigion and arrived at Cummelby.
It was a bit different from Ravigion.
The number of explorers had increased significantly, and the attire of people with ordinary occupations was much more formal than the average in Ravigion.
Of course, it wasn’t comparable to the imperial capital.
*Clank, clank.*
Regardless, the carriage wheels kept rolling.
“Wooooooahhhh!”
Countless people, shouts, outstretched arms.
Despite seeing all this, I cannot feel happy. The situation feels suffocating.
If only there had been no foul play in this expedition…
If only all the members had returned alive.
They would be able to witness this scene with me…
If that had been the case, I would have been able to join them, shouting with joy.
*Woooong-*
Heavy…
*Woooong-*
Heavy.
*Clank, clank.*
The carriage, which continued to roll without stopping, passed through Cummelby and entered the imperial capital.  It sped down the straight road, heading directly towards the royal palace. The palace gates, normally closed with an imposing air, stood wide open.
“The heroes have arrived!”
A row of knights stood at the entrance of the open gates.
On the walls, the military band played a climactic melody with passion.
And then…
“I’ve ended up here again.”
The carriage, which seemed as if it would keep rolling forever, came to a stop.
It was in front of ‘The Palace of Glory,’ where my investiture had taken place.
“Welcome the heroes!”
The palace doors swung open, and we stepped out of the carriage and entered the palace.
The procession was a little different from when we were in parade formation.
Before, I was riding in the carriage at the center, but this time, I am leading the way.
“Wooooooahhhh!”
The cheers that erupted as we entered the palace were a little quieter than those on the streets.
Well, the people here are mostly nobles, high-ranking officials of trading companies, or guild members.
“What are you doing? Move along.”
Kaislan poked my back as I stood at the entrance, staring blankly at the surroundings.
Tsk, always so impatient.
*Thump, thump.*
I walked along the red carpet that stretched all the way to the vacant throne room.
Despite walking, I kept looking around.
A crowd of people, shouting, whistling, and looking through binoculars with curious eyes.
That’s why it was easy to find them even among thousands of people.
*Thump.*
In this place blessed by all, only they were laughing, their mourning a discordant note amidst the joyful crowd.
‘Yes, that’s where they are.’
“Now, hold on… where are you going!”
Ignoring Kaislan’s attempt to stop me, I turned and headed towards the audience seats.
Did they figure out where I’m headed?
“Damn it, I don’t know either.”
Kaislan no longer tried to stop me.
*Thump, thump.*
Our procession changed direction.
The military band, which had been surrounding us, followed awkwardly, maintaining their professionalism by not showing their confusion.
And then…
*Thump.*
We finally stood in front of them.
“…”
The people who had been silently wiping away their tears looked at me with slightly surprised faces.
The families of the members who had passed away, who I had asked the countess to allow to enter The Palace of Glory.
*Baa-bum, Baa-bum, Baa-ba-ba-bum-*
No, it’s been bothering me from the beginning.
Can’t they just stop making noise already?
I was annoyed, but the band seemed to have no idea, nor the authority, to stop.  So I went over and snatched the instruments, throwing them onto the ground.
*Clang!*
With the music abruptly ceasing, a silence filled the space.
The crowd finally stopped cheering, and only the sounds of the families of the fallen members sobbing resonated clearly.
And then…
*Thump.*
I knelt in front of them.
“I’m sorry. I couldn’t bring back the people who were precious to you.”
As I bowed my head, the members behind me followed suit.
This was a ritual that should have been performed in front of the empty throne, but who cares about something like that?
The king won’t even show his face this time, anyway.
“Thank you…”
While they bowed deeply, unable to even look at me, I felt a cautious touch on my head.
“How did Ashid… Ashid die?”
Ah, so she was Ashid’s wife.
“That fellow… he was like a great wizard in a fairy tale. He wasn’t afraid of death at all, and it was all thanks to him that we were able to return alive.”
She didn’t speak for a moment, her eyes filled with sorrow.
She simply sobbed quietly.
“I… I see… ”
Come to think of it, that guy was a liar.
He said his wife was strong…
“What… what do I do… what do I do…  I feel… so sorry for my husband… what do I…”
“…”
“Huuwaaaack!”
The woman who had touched my head cried out in sorrow and collapsed onto the floor.
And then, it was like a dam breaking.
“M, McKelly Rayathers… how did she… how did she die? I… I never heard anything about it.  All I was told was that she was dead, and that I should join the procession.”
“B, Bentis Gerode! He was my father! But I didn’t even know he was going on a dangerous mission like this!”
“Kala! Tell me! Why… why can’t Rick be here! Why are you the only one who returned alive?”
The others rushed to us, pouring out their questions.  We, like criminals, answered with the fabricated endings we had created.
And as they watched us.
“What is this?  Is this part of the event?”
“Wow, the royal family really went all out for this.”
“I’ve never seen such an impressive homecoming.”
“No, no matter how you look at it, this looks like a mess… but hey, it’s entertaining.”
The crowd watched us with amused expressions.
How long did this chaos last?
“…We cannot afford to linger any longer.”
The knights, following the countess's orders, approached and managed the situation.  The homecoming ceremony resumed.
We, who had strayed from our course, stepped onto the red carpet once again and headed towards the vacant throne.
The countess stood before it.
‘Finally, you’re showing your face.  You’ve been hiding inside the crystal orb all this time.’
I glanced at her once, then knelt and bowed my head.
It was not out of respect, unlike before.
I simply thought that it would be difficult to hold back my emotions if I met her eyes.
“You’ve come a long way, heroes!”
The countess, without caring if I had made a scene or not, continued with her prepared lines.
Then, she summarized our journey.
Thirty heroes, entrusted with a noble mission, have finally completed their duty.  They have survived countless trials and returned alive.
The story was unnecessarily long due to the countless praises added to it, but that was all it was.
It was a fabricated story, not the truth.
Even the part about the rescue team not being able to reach us was omitted from the negotiation with the countess.
However…
“Even the cold of the polar region couldn’t extinguish your passion. The traitors from the underworld couldn’t take your lives.”
The crowd erupted in applause as the countess praised our accomplishments.
“Ahem, ahem… first, I would like to discuss what sacrifice means.”
The Archbishop of the Tobera Church, who seemed to be experiencing hair loss, appeared after the countess retreated.  He spoke words of comfort to us, particularly mentioning the priests and paladins who had suffered heavy casualties, and then called for a moment of silence.
*Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep-*
Next was the Duke’s family.
*Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep-*
Then, the Explorer’s Guild.
The next, and the next, and the next…
*Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep-*
The ones who were planning to share the spoils of this expedition appeared one by one in front of the crowd, each taking their share of the spotlight.
*Clang!*
Wow, I thought about this, but it really isn’t easy.
Fortunately, my previous actions had shortened the event, so the time of endurance was short.
Finally, the homecoming ceremony reached its climax.
“May the light of the royal family shine upon you.”
The music began to play again with the countess’s words.
Like a school event, it was time to salute the national flag.
‘This part was three minutes long, I think.’
I waited exactly two minutes before speaking.
Loud enough for the countess, who was about three meters away, to hear.
“Excuse me, Countess.”
The countess stared at me like I was crazy.
Well, would you expect a person in the spotlight to be of sound mind when they’re distracted at the most important moment of the event?  Especially when nearly all the nobles are present.
“When will I get my name back?”
Did she decide that if I didn’t get an answer, I would ruin the event? The countess, her gaze fixed on the empty throne, hurriedly replied.
“As I said before, it will take another two months.”
“Two months… ”
“That was the agreement.”
“It was.”
I chuckled and continued.
“But now that I think about it, it seems a little too long.  I wish it could be expedited.”
The countess didn’t answer.
It was time for the event to resume, as the music had just stopped.
“…”
She glared at me once before continuing her praise of the royal family.
Tsk, even if she was in a hurry, she could have at least given me an answer.
I can’t just leave it like this.
Don’t the barbarians understand unless you speak forcefully?
“May the light of the royal family shine upon you!”
The countess, who had been lecturing for a long time about how great and merciful the royal family is, yelled at us.
This was the final event of the homecoming ceremony as she had told us.
“Now, Expedition Leader Riehen Schuitz, report!”
A kind of personnel report.
Once this report is officially made, our long expedition will officially be over.
That’s why…
「Character has used the skill [Gigantification].」
「Enlarges the body in proportion to strength.」
I used [Transcendence] to enhance my body to its limits.
Well, I need to be at least this big for them to recognize me.
Thousands of eyes focused on me as my body suddenly grew.
“How dare you use your abilities within the palace!”
“This is no place for such things!  An insult to the royal family!”
Some were angry that I used my skill.
But then…
“…Gi, Gigantification?”
Bjorn Jandel’s signature skill, that’s what it was.
“Is, Is this a coincidence?”
“No, wait… it seems kind of similar.”
“But that man is dead, is he not?”
“And most importantly, he is a wraith.”
The people who recognized it questioned what was happening.
And what about the countess?
“!”
As I used Gigantification, she fell backwards.
What, did she think I was going to assassinate her here?
*Swish.*
I tore my gaze away from the countess and stared at the empty throne.
Then…
“I will tell the truth, in the presence of the sole monarch.”
My gaze was fixed ahead, but I spoke loud enough for everyone in the hall to hear.
Clearly, one by one, my voice resonated.  To the families of the fallen, I revealed what had happened, silently carving those moments into my heart.
“Pike Neldaine.”
He was condemned as a traitor and executed in Ice Rock.
At the time, I thought it was the best option, but now I regret it a little. If he had wanted the expedition to fail, perhaps he was our ally.
“Phillip Aintropi.”
He was a navigator for Kaislan’s team.
He lost his life in a surprise attack while waiting for the rescue team in Deadwood.
His head had been crushed.
I didn’t have the chance to talk to him much, but I heard later from Kaislan.
He was a filial son who hadn’t married and took care of his aging parents.
“Mite Million.”
He died instantly from the [Thorn of the Earth’s End] when we escaped Deadwood.
A death without even a death rattle.
I guess I’ll be curious about that for the rest of my life.
Was it inevitable? Or was it something he could have avoided but chose to endure?
“Fiona Eimers.”
She died in a blind attack while chanting a mass teleportation spell with other mages.
“Niaro Cambell.”
The priest, trying to help an injured warrior, stepped forward and died.
“Milburn Naria.”
Our always polite Troll Summoner.
He protected everyone else but chose a lonely death for himself.
I hope he woke up in a house filled with the scent of coffee.
“Matt Hybriham.”
He was a Paladin who filled the tank role.
But I had stripped him of all his equipment. He desperately tried to clear a path without his gear, and he lost his life near the peak of the Ice Eye.
“Pasible Eric Coulson.”
A friend and subordinate who had fought with Kaislan for a long time. Kaislan comforted me, his eyes filled with tears at his friend’s death.
Because I was there.
Because he didn’t give up until the end.
His death was meaningful.
‘That’s… the burden I have to carry from now on.’
I continued.
“Rick Jugershtar.”
He died fighting the Noark after we regrouped.
The cause of death was the [Thorn of the Earth’s End] that killed Mite Million.
“Bentis Gerode.”
He bought us time to retreat when the Rose Knights attacked from behind.
He always said he wanted a romantic life.
A mage doing something a warrior would do… did he achieve his romantic dream?
“Loita Maemender.”
He died in a Rose Knights attack when he was helping us from the cliff above.
He was a priest with a very strict tone.
“McKellie Rayathers.”
She was a mage for Akuraba’s team.
She hasn’t woken up after being affected by [Soul Extraction].
“Rowan Belliaro.”
A cheerful old man whose motto was to live a long and thin life, always remaining average.
He died in a surprise attack by the Rose Knights who took advantage of the darkness.
“June.”
The noble paladin who died standing.
Even his enemies realized his death long after the fact.  He was a truly great man, to the very end.
“Tsuon Iriban.”
An archer on the 5th team.
Kallui’s priest summoned a monster, breaking through Sven Parav’s line of defense.  The monster tore Tsuon’s upper and lower body apart.
Before his death, he asked the priest for a favor.
He wanted him to sing the Anthem of Hope?
Despite being unable to hear, due to the penalty.
“Futa Ricarbon.”
The guy lived by being a troubleshooter for the Kelluners Duke’s family.
A versatile jack-of-all-trades who handled both pathfinding and close combat.
His fighting skills were just okay.
But he killed two Rose Knights in a row at the end…
I couldn’t believe it even after I heard the story.
If we could have filmed it, it would have been enough to play it at his funeral. Duke, your discarded troubleshooter was a pretty awesome guy.
“…What power!”
The knights, who had approached me, pulled on my arms.
But was my appearance too strange?
“Stop.”
The countess dismissed the knights.
What a surprise, she’s finally doing something I like.
“Periton Eriabos, Benjamin Orman.”
These two used the priests’ ultimate skill, a sacrificial spell, to take down the god’s summoned creature.
If it hadn’t been for these two, we would have all died.
“Learde Ashid.”
He used an awakening magic like Dwalki.
Not only did he inflict great damage on the god’s summoned creature, but he also killed three Rose Knights?
Marone, on the day before the closure, told me, weeping, that he was the one who was supposed to do it, but Ashid stopped him.
“Gould Alditi.”
He came rushing in, breaking through the front lines, saying that he could handle the aftermath if it were him.
That old man, did he not want to live?
‘Yeah, so many of them died.’
As I quietly recited their names one by one, the weight of it all hit me.
Then, I continued calmly.
After all, this is the moment for the final report.
“20 dead in total.”
Twenty.
Each with their own dreams, or goals, who had volunteered for this dangerous mission.
They died.
In the cold snow.
In such a tragic and lonely way.
Yearning for something desperately.
They weren’t all good guys, of course.
One of them had embezzled funds from the company he belonged to, and June, in particular, had tortured innocent people, I heard.  Futa Ricarbon, the troubleshooter for the Duke’s family, probably did all sorts of bad things.
There’s bound to be someone out there who’ll say they’re glad they’re dead.
But.
One thing is for sure.
‘…There was no one who deserved to die like that.’
We survived because of those people.
That’s why…
“Lilith Marone, Versil Goulond, James Kala, Meland Kaislan…”
I need to make it clear.
For our own survival, too.
“Sven Parav, Raviyieniastrous, Emily Rains, Titana Akuraba, Erwin Pornach di Tercia…”
Just before I said my own name, I lifted my head and looked at the countess.
She was looking at me with a sales-pitch smile.
Since I used [Gigantification], I guess she figured it wouldn’t be worth trying to stop me.
Then, the countess whispered as she looked at me.
“Tsk, if only you had endured a little longer, it would have been better for both of us.”
Yeah, maybe it would have been better for you.
But I can’t be powerless without getting my name back soon.
Let’s make this bigger.
So, in that sense…
“Proud Junbaron of the royal family.”
I declared it in front of thousands of nobles.
“I, Bjorn, son of Jandel, report that I, as the leader of the expedition, have completed all missions and have returned alive!”
I’ve returned.
