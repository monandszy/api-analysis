[Dungeon and Stone] was my specialty. I could recite any monster, its location, habits, and weaknesses without a moment's hesitation. Based on this expertise, I had reached a firm conclusion. My knowledge, combined with a Barbarian’s physique, would be enough to survive the labyrinth. At least, I genuinely believed so back then.
“Ugh…”
The moment I stepped into the labyrinth, darkness enveloped me. Not figuratively, but literally. I couldn’t see a thing. Even if someone blindfolded me, I wouldn’t have noticed. It wouldn’t have made a difference anyway.
“Damn it.”
I felt like I'd been hit hard in the back of the head. I hadn’t even questioned the lack of torches with the Barbarians, all of them carrying just a single weapon. The first floor shouldn’t have needed them. The crystals embedded in the walls were supposed to provide illumination. Of course, there were dark zones on the first floor, but they were only found in the outer regions leading to the second floor—
‘Wait, did I end up in one of those dark zones?’
My mind raced, forming a hypothesis. Starting positions were randomized when entering the labyrinth. Random, they called it, but being thrown into a place like this was hardly random. Even if you started in the outer regions, a glowing crystal was always nearby. 
But this wasn't just a game world I viewed through a monitor. 
What if all those conveniences were just the developer’s way of making the game easier for players? What if, in reality, dark zones could be the starting point? If that was the case, it explained my current situation. No, it had to be. If the entire first floor was like this, I wouldn’t last a day.
“Whew…”
Taking a deep breath and calming myself, I felt my eyes adjust to the darkness. I could barely make out outlines, but it was better than before. This wasn't a hopeless situation, not yet. Time to assess the situation. I was finally alone.
“Status window, inventory, character information, stats, inventory, log… Damn it.”
No luck. I hadn't expected it anyway. 
“Let’s go.”
With my shield in one hand and the wall in the other, I moved forward. My pace was slightly faster than crawling. Or was it? Maybe crawling would have been faster, but I couldn’t move any quicker. It was too risky. 
“Aaaaaaagh!”
A sharp pain erupted from my ankle. It was a sensation I’d never experienced before. My nerves went haywire, but even in that moment of pain, I assessed the situation. What had gone wrong?
The answer came to me, even without a combat log.
“Character stepped on a Goblin trap.”
Damn it, I’d stepped on a trap. 
***
What was my blunder? It was obvious. The shield had provided me with a sense of security. But it had also obscured a large part of my vision. If I had strapped the shield to my waist and focused on my surroundings, I might have spotted the trap. What good was the shield if I couldn’t see anything anyway? Practicality should have trumped mental security. 
Damn it.
“Ugh… Whew…”
My head spun. I wanted to scream. But I held it back, knowing it wouldn’t improve the situation. In fact, it might make it worse.
My heart pounded like a malfunctioning engine.
“Breathe, breathe, breathe…”
I clenched my lips, forcing myself to regulate my breathing. Now wasn’t the time to dwell on my pain or my misery. There was only one monster that used traps on the first floor. Goblins. And one was definitely nearby.
“….”
I reflexively raised my shield to protect my head. Then, I held my breath and focused on my hearing. There was no sound, as if time itself had stopped.
…Was it gone?
I didn’t know. It was possible. Maybe it had stepped away for a moment, or something. Even Goblins had to relieve themselves.
‘Damn it. I don’t even believe that.’
I quickly squashed the glimmer of hope that was creeping into my mind. For two reasons. One, optimism and positivity were different. And two, I needed a pessimistic mindset right now.
“….”
If I couldn’t be certain, I’d assume the worst. The Goblin had heard me scream. It was lurking in the shadows, waiting for me to weaken. That’s why I couldn’t hear anything. It always worked that way in the game. Where there was a trap, a Goblin was always nearby.
“Whew…”
I slowly let out the breath I’d been holding. Regardless of how it happened, this silent environment meant that I’d be able to detect it if I stayed alert.  Time to focus on what I needed to do.
“…Ugh!”
I lowered myself to the ground, used both hands to pry open the trap, and pulled my foot free. Then, I ripped a strip off my pants, took off my shoe, and applied pressure to the wound.  I decided to throw away the tattered shoe. 
It wasn't even really a shoe. More like a sandal. Damn Barbarian bastards. If they’d at least given me a pair of leather boots, I wouldn’t be half-crippled after stepping on a trap.
‘Damn it. What am I thinking?’
I felt a chill run down my spine as I realized my own irrationality.  Enough with the pity party. The situation wouldn’t change no matter how much I cursed them.  It was my fault for not checking the ground properly. So stop whining and assess my condition.
‘Ugh, this is bad.’
I could no longer feel my right foot. I could sense the heat, but even that was fading.
“I know you’re hiding. Come out.”
I whispered quietly.
Still, there was no sign of movement beyond the darkness. I slowly stepped forward.
Thump. Thump.
Despite my broken leg, the pain wasn’t as bad as I’d expected. It must be the paralyzing venom…  Not sure if I should call this a good thing or not.
“Come out, you bastard!”
I continued to taunt the creature, ignoring the pain.  I didn’t have time on my side. If I had to fight, the sooner the better. It wasn’t just the injury I had to worry about. It was also possible the Goblin was waiting for reinforcements. 
“Not coming?”
Of course, this could all be a figment of my imagination. Maybe there were no Goblins after all. Then I’d be a complete fool, stumbling around and making a fool of myself after stepping on a trap. But what did it matter?  Even if I was a fool, I wanted to be a fool who survived. 
“Then just stay there. I’m leaving.”
I increased my pace. Not much faster than crawling, but it felt like running a marathon at full speed.  One step, one step. The effort made my right foot throb. 
“Ugh… Whew… Whew…”
There were two possibilities. The venom was wearing off, or the pain was too intense, even with the venom.  Either way, it wasn’t a bad thing. If the venom was wearing off, then that was good. And if I could feel pain, then that meant my nerve cells were still alive.
‘Wait, why am I being optimistic about this?’
I didn’t want to think about it. I didn’t have the mental energy. 
“…Your mother’s a Goblin.”
The words tumbled out of my brain, unfiltered. Too much blood loss? My brain felt soaked in alcohol. 
“Your father’s a Goblin.”
Of course, I kept walking even as the words spilled out. 
“And you’re a Goblin.”
That’s when I heard the sound for the first time. It was faint, but it echoed loud and clear in my focused ears.
Thump.
The creature finally revealed its presence.
“Why, even you can’t take your parents being insulted?”
I knew that wasn’t the reason. It wasn’t even an insult.  The sound had come from behind me.  It must have been forced to move because I was getting further away.
I increased my speed. The creature’s footsteps followed suit.
Thump. Thump. Thump. Thump.
The creature’s distinct footsteps were a bit strange. It sounded like something sticky was sticking and detaching from a smooth surface with each step.  Despite knowing it was supposed to be barely a meter tall, it felt like a monstrous creature chasing me. 
To keep my fear at bay, I kept talking to it. I was a Barbarian. If I could lure it into close combat, I wouldn’t lose to a Goblin.
“Don’t just follow me. Come on, you scumbag.”
I continued to taunt it, but it kept a steady distance, always following.  The creature seemed to have given up on hiding. 
“Grrr, grrr…!”
It was more like a howl, but I could somehow sense it.
“Grrrrrr! Grrr!”
It was laughing. It was genuinely delighted to see its prey bleeding to death. It was hoping I’d hear that sound and be afraid.
…Clever little thing. 
Alright, change of plan. I stopped walking.  Then, I stumbled and fell to the ground. 
Thump!
My forehead slammed into a rock, and I felt like it would shatter, but I didn’t make a sound.  This was a game of patience. If it thought I was down and came closer, then I’d win. If I actually passed out before that, I’d lose.
“Grrr?”
I decided to trust in the toughness of this body, which had carried me nearly 300 meters despite my broken leg.
Thump.
The creature’s footsteps gradually approached. At a pace so slow it was almost a yawn. Even though it saw its prey fall, it was still suspicious.
‘Damn it. Goblins are so cautious?’
I couldn’t help but curse. In the game, Goblins were the weakest, most basic monsters. They used poison and traps, but aside from that, their combat abilities were terrible. But what was this Goblin like in reality? 
Thump.
It was no laughing matter.  I understood why the town NPCs always talked about how cunning Goblins were.  They were far more intelligent than those Barbarian bastards.
Thump.
The creature stopped, somewhere between 5 and 10 meters away. Why?
As I wondered about the reason, a dull impact struck my shoulder.
Thud. Thud. Thud. Thud.
What the hell? Did that little shit just throw a rock at me?
‘…Is it going to throw rocks at me until I’m a bloody mess?’
“Grrrrrr! Grrr!”
Contrary to my fears, it let out a delighted howl.  Seeing that I didn’t react to the rocks, it must have thought I was dead.
Thump. Thump. Thump. Thump.
The creature quickly closed the distance. I could feel how excited it was about the chase.
I suppressed my excitement, calmly gauging the distance by the sounds. As soon as I determined it was close enough…
“You little shit!”
I stood up, reaching out toward the creature.  I decided it would be quicker and have a longer effective range if I just grabbed it, rather than picking up my shield and swinging it.
But I quickly realized my plan had backfired.  Two reasons, as usual.
First, the creature was still a step away.
Second, it was much more agile than I’d expected.
“Grrr!”
It slipped away, dodging backward.  I couldn’t see it, but I could sense it. I instinctively knew I’d missed.
Damn it, what now? I racked my brain for a backup plan. But in that instant, my body moved on its own.
“…?”
It was an odd sensation. My vision was still dark, but I instinctively knew where the Goblin had jumped. As soon as I realized that, my hand was already on a new trajectory, reaching for the creature.
“Grrr?!”
I felt something grab my fingers.  Arm, ankle, neck. It didn’t matter.
“Aaaaaaaaagh!”
I roared, slamming the creature to the ground.  Crack! Something broke. But I didn’t dare let up. I immediately climbed on top of the creature’s torso.
“Grrr, grrr!”
The tables had turned.
“I’m on top, you’re on the bottom. You little shit!”
I pummeled the creature’s face like a madman. I was so excited that I might have punched the ground a few times, but this Barbarian body was stronger than I expected. Instead of hurting my fist, it was the stone floor that cracked.
“….”
Soon, the creature stopped moving. Then…
Whoosh. Whoosh. Whoosh. Whoosh!
Dust billowed into the air.  Strangely, it was glowing dust.  I stopped punching.  The Goblin’s body was disintegrating, breaking down into tiny particles that floated around me. 
I was speechless.
“Damn it, is this still the same?”
Please, just pick one. Game world, or reality that’s just kind of similar? I keep getting confused about which rules to follow.
“Goblin defeated. EXP +1”
The Goblin vanished without a trace. I felt an inexplicable sense of emptiness as I picked up the small pebble that had fallen nearby.
“9th grade gemstone obtained.”
It wasn’t very strong, but it glowed faintly. It was a gemstone, a currency in [Dungeon and Stone]. How much was it worth? I remembered.
“One piece of bread.”
The average price of a gemstone dropped by a Goblin in the game. I couldn’t help but chuckle.
“Hehehe… ”
So all that effort just earned me this?  The jumble in my head cleared.  It was like when you’re crying and then you start laughing strangely. 
“Hehehe…”
There was a labyrinth, and there were monsters. Dead monsters left behind items, then disappeared. And outside, in the city, real monsters lived alongside other races. This was definitely that kind of world.
But…
I wouldn’t let myself get confused again.
