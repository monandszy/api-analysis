## Chapter 388: Wild Horse (2)
The community of evil spirits, a place that opened every 15th of the month at midnight. Time flowed differently within the Ghostbusters compared to the outside world. 
“One hour here is one second outside.” 
In other words, even if you spent all 12 hours that the community was active, only 12 seconds would have passed outside. 
However…
“He wouldn’t make me wait that long, would he?”
The Marquis’ intention was clear. He harbored an unconfirmed suspicion about me, and he would try to confirm it tonight. 
The only question was how much time I had. 
I wanted at least four seconds. That would allow me to participate in and leave the Round Table, which started in three hours. It would also eliminate any suspicion arising from the Lion’s absence and prevent the loss of information from missing a Round Table session.
Damn it.
“Four seconds is too risky.”
I suppressed the burgeoning greed within me. 
Yes, I should give up gracefully, as planned. 
Click, click.
The computer booted up as I made my decision. I quickly navigated to the chatroom to check.
[Long Live Korean Independence] - 1 player online.
I joined the chatroom without wasting any time.
[HS123]
The player online was indeed Hyunbyeol. I wondered if the GM had granted my request and released Baekho from his ban, letting him join. But that could wait, there was still time.
“You came?”
Hyunbyeol, seated on the sofa, looked up at me, her legs crossed. A white blouse and a skirt. Her attire was the same as always.
“What’s with that tone? It’s like I wouldn’t have come.”
I sat on the sofa across from her and casually responded. Our familiar banter reminded me of the old days.
“I thought you might not come, oppa. You always run away from things that are even slightly inconvenient.”
What’s that supposed to mean, run away?
“Unless it’s something I absolutely have to solve, it’s more efficient to skip it.”
It’s the universal rule to skip events where the reward is low compared to the difficulty. 
Seeking efficiency means reducing waste. 
Just like right now.
“Hyunbyeol.”
I cut through the meaningless chatter and got straight to the point. I had no time to waste.
“Did you meet the GM last time?”
It was the real reason I had come to the chatroom despite not having time for the Round Table. I wanted to confirm this, especially considering this time’s agenda.
Hyunbyeol slightly furrowed her brows before opening her small lips.
“…How did you know?”
Her response was not a denial but an affirmation. I calmly explained the basis of my suspicions.
“Something felt off when the message came in while we were talking. I looked into it a bit.”
I first felt a sense of unease after I parted ways with Hyunbyeol. When I returned to my room and touched my mouse, I remembered the GM who had shown a strong interest in this chatroom. 
The GM might not be able to eavesdrop on our chatroom conversations, but he could certainly check who was in it.
I suspected that the GM had sent Hyunbyeol a message, so I searched for a specific chatroom and kept an eye on the number of people in it. And soon, I found confirmation.
“The number of people in the secret chatroom the GM often uses increased from two to three. It was just a coincidence, but I wondered if it was you.”
“…Then why didn’t you call me back then, oppa? Why wait until today?”
“The GM could have snooped on the message.”
“But you could have just told me to come to the chatroom.”
“It would have been suspicious.”
“…Annoying.”
Hyunbyeol rolled her eyes and sighed. 
“Let me tell you beforehand, I wasn’t trying to deceive you, oppa.”
“I know.”
“I was going to tell you today. It’s just…  you wouldn’t believe me…  Oppa, what did you just say?”
“I said I know. You weren’t trying to deceive me.”
Hyunbyeol’s expression turned strange at my words.
“You’re right, I feel better now…  but on what grounds?”
The reason was simple.
“If you had wanted to hide it, you wouldn’t have so easily affirmed my question.”
Given her personality, she would have been more meticulous in hiding it. She might have even denied it until the end, even though she knew she’d be found out. 
“But what if I was acting?”
“That line of questioning goes nowhere. If you still can’t believe it, just assume I wanted to believe you.”
I chuckled and joked, making Hyunbyeol shut her mouth tightly. 
She looked at me for a long time before…
“…Oppa, did you get a girlfriend here?”
She threw me such a random question. 
Misha came to mind immediately, but I decided to figure out why she asked first.
“But why suddenly……?”
I asked back, and Hyunbyeol trailed off in a slightly strange voice. 
“Just…  I think your eloquence has improved…”
Was it praise, or was it a criticism? I decided to take it as praise and changed the subject. This wasn’t a topic I wanted to dwell on, and I had no time to do so anyway.
“Hyunbyeol, I’m short on time, okay?”
“Is this what you meant by efficient avoidance, oppa?”
“No, I really don’t have time. I’ll just get the information I need and leave. Just answer this.”
“Okay, what is it?”
“What did the GM offer you?”
“GP, and a few other things. He said he would give me anything if I became a spy for him.”
“As I suspected.”
“Why are you so fascinating, oppa, that he’s so obsessed? His nickname is weird too…”
“It just happened. I’m not really doing anything special.”
I brushed it off, and Hyunbyeol didn’t press further.
“…Anyway, so what do you want me to do?”
“Tell them what I want them to know.”
“Okay, but will you actually do what you say?”
“Have I ever not done what you asked?”
Well… a lot, actually? 
No, but I think I’ve always done everything, even if I grumbled about it. Whatever, let’s just talk.
“Tell them the information I want them to know.”
“Okay. So, is there something going on?”
“I’ll be logging out immediately after I leave this chatroom. The GM will be curious. Tell him I’m in the middle of a fight and can’t talk for long. Tell him I’ll contact him later and had to leave in a hurry.”
“Okay. But there’s just one thing I need to ask.”
“What is it?”
“What’s the real reason you’re logging out?”
“That? It’s similar to what I told the GM.”
“So… you really are in the middle of a fight? The dungeon hasn’t even opened yet.”
“I told you it’s similar.”
It’s not like only physical combat counts as a fight, right? Anyway, I think that’s all the answers I need.
“I’m going! See you later!”
I left the chatroom before Hyunbyeol could say anything.
***
A quiet study, filled with furniture she designed and filled.
“I’ll be going then… ”
“Yes, I’ll transfer the promised GP right away.”
“Yes, then… ”
As the intellectual-looking, yet somewhat awkward, East Asian woman left the room, the GM murmured quietly.
“He said he was in the middle of a fight…  It’s strange. If that man needs to save every second, it means he’s facing a formidable opponent, someone on his level.”
The GM’s voice was filled with a sense of exhaustion. The Soul Queens, who had been with him for a long time, knew the reason behind that emotion. 
She felt the same way, after all.
HS123. 
The Korean woman who had said, "Just call me Blackstar if you find it awkward."
They hadn’t known anything about him until she told them. Literally nothing. 
They were confident in their information gathering abilities, but they hadn’t even sensed a sign until this titan clashed in the shadows.
“…Still, it’s a good thing we got Blackstar on our side. If a clash that could make that man struggle occurred, there’s bound to be evidence. Let’s focus on finding that evidence for now.”
While nodding in agreement to the GM’s words, the Soul Queens didn’t hesitate to raise a question.
“But there’s something strange. If it was that urgent, wouldn’t he have a reason to join the chatroom?”
“But it’s him. He didn’t look that urgent. Maybe he was confident.”
“That…  makes sense.”
It was an odd situation, but the Soul Queens believed that it could very well have been the case. No, she was sure of it.
She couldn’t imagine the Lion looking flustered. He was like a giant.
He walked with a calm confidence, even though he knew he was right, and left a great impression.
“But…  Soul Queens, don’t you have to prepare?”
“Prepare? For what?”
“It’s about time to join the Round Table.”
“But the Lion won’t be there.”
“Even so, isn’t there a lot of useful information being discussed there? Especially since the Body Collector is there, the link to Noark. You should go. You might get information about the conflict that’s probably happening somewhere right now.”
“You’re right…  okay.”
The Soul Queens obeyed the GM’s command without a word and left the chatroom.  When it was time to enter the Round Table, she immediately entered ‘The Guardian’s Round Table’.
“You’re early.”
The Fox Mask was there before her.
They exchanged brief greetings, and other members started to join one by one.
The Goblin, the Crescent Moon. And…
“Pish, why’s Deer Antler not here today?”
The Jester.
Five members gathered around the Round Table, and it continued until the door slammed shut, signaling the end of the entry period. 
“Whether Deer Antler died somewhere or not is none of my business, but this is a problem. The Lion isn’t here.”
The Jester stood up without any hesitation. He grumbled nonstop even as he stood up.
“Really, you guys keep bringing such boring stuff, that’s why he’s not here! Ugh, if I think about these people strutting around with their necks held high…  ”
He mumbled as he headed towards the door, but then he trailed off and looked at the Soul Queens.
“What? You’re not coming?”
“No. I’m just here to participate this time.”
“If I leave, only these little brats will be left.”
The Soul Queens giggled, covering the spot where her mouth should be, in response to the Jester’s arrogant words.
“Oh my, what a fun thing to say. You’re not much different, Jester.”
“Do you think I’m at their level?”
“Well, considering the Lion isn’t here because he’s not satisfied with the information we provided, I’d say we’re all about the same, wouldn’t you?”
“…It seems you’re implying you know why he’s not here.”
“Well, I can’t just tell you, can I? Oh, alright, how about we just go around and see?”
“…Pish, how arrogant. I almost fell for it. You wouldn’t know anything about the Lion.”
“You’re so sure? Then just leave if you want.”
She spoke sarcastically, but the Jester, who had been standing at the door, didn’t move. It was something she expected. The Jester’s blind interest in the Lion wasn’t anything new.
Thud.
The Jester, who had been heading towards the door, turned and sat down, muttering as if in self-defense.
“…Well, it wouldn’t hurt to see what ridiculous things you’ll say. Pish.”
He spoke rudely, but it was exactly as she intended. She needed the Jester there, he was the one who brought the high-quality information, after all.
“…..”
“…..”
As the Jester sat down, everyone’s eyes naturally turned to her. She raised the corner of her lips under the mask, seeing those eyes full of anticipation and curiosity.
She wasn’t planning on going first, but she didn’t have any reason to avoid it.
“Pish, why are you just sitting there when the game is on? I mean, I couldn’t figure it out, but how could you— ”
She cut him off and muttered briefly.
“The Lion is currently fighting someone.”
As soon as she finished speaking, the Jester, instead of getting angry that she had cut him off, turned his gaze to one place. The jewel that revealed the truth.
Not only the Jester, but all the members were staring at it with bright eyes. And…
Swoosh, swoosh, swoosh.
The jewel emitted light.
“It, it’s green.”
As soon as the Goblin broke the silence, commotion arose.
“Queen, did you figure out the Lion’s identity?”
The Crescent Moon, excited, stood up, pushing the table back. The Fox Mask also whispered softly.
“It’s not the Queen. It’s the GM, right?”
“Th, than that…  The Lion isn’t even at the meeting because he’s fighting, who could he be fighting…  ”
The Goblin also seemed to have realized that something unusual was happening, trailing off his words. And…
“…..”
The Jester remained silent.
“The Jester is suddenly quiet… ”
“How… ”
“…..?”
“How did you know…  Did he tell you? But then why? Why tell you before me?”
The Jester’s words, which had been leisurely a moment ago, were now filled with excitement, and his eyes, peeking out from under the mask, were piercing her. He was looking at her with an intense interest, more so than any other time.
“Hmm, I wonder why.”
She unconsciously raised the corner of her lips.
“Maybe I’ll tell you if you tell me a fun story?”
It was addictive.
***
[The character has been moved to Lapdonia.]
***
It had been about 20 minutes in the Ghostbusters. Translated to real time, that was about 0.3 seconds. It was such a short time to go from being alone in a room to being harmed.
However, after finishing my conversation with Hyunbyeol, I didn’t hesitate to press the logout button. After all, I had decided not to go to the Round Table. 
Even if I stayed, I would only be looking around the bulletin board and giggling, so I decided it was better to leave early and prepare for the situation.
But…
“It’s quiet.”
When I opened my eyes, I was greeted by the same darkness as before. I couldn’t hear anything, and the window was tightly shut —
Click.
The locked door opened at that moment.
And then, that moment.
Swoosh.
Even though my eyes were closed, the body of a warrior who had entered the realm of superhumanity sensed an unknown presence approaching me quickly.
“If I had taken my time, it would have been a disaster.”
The time it took for the door to open and for the intruder to reach me was a fraction of a second. This was ridiculous, not even a cockroach could be this fast.
I immediately stood up and stretched out my hand.
Whack.
I instantly grabbed the intruder’s neck. 
“!”
I stood up from the bed with my hand still holding the neck, and then I confirmed the identity of the uninvited guest in the dead of night. 
I had caught someone I never expected.
“Eltora Terselion.”
I didn’t expect the Chancellor’s son to come in person. Of course, there was no need to be flustered. Even if it was his grandfather instead, I’d still do what I had to do.
“…You should be prepared to die.”
I’m going to make him pay for making me miss community activities.
