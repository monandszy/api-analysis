## Chapter 673: Stargrave (4)
"How long has it been since I last encountered one of these?" 
The thought crossed my mind as I faced it, a familiar yet terrifying sight—a Hans. 
"The last one was K, wasn't it...?"
Hans Kaiser. A creature I had the misfortune of meeting during my time operating under the alias of Rihën Schweiz in the Dark Continent. 
And...
"The Noirk ambush began barely two hours after we met."
Thankfully, we managed to escape with minimal casualties, but it was a close call.  If Raven hadn't changed her mind at the last minute, my journey could have ended that day, trapped within the "Silent Cage."
However, that isn't the point...
"Hans L."
The code for this Hans. 
Admittedly, I'm not entirely convinced that the beast that transformed into a monster and died is also classified as "Hans." But better safe than sorry. 
Thump-thump-thump!
My heart pounded wildly. I followed its rhythm and yelled with all my might, "Prepare to move!"
Of course, the others were utterly baffled by my sudden reaction.
"Huh? What's going on?"
"I sense no presence of monsters…"
My two-tailed tiger and archer, visibly confused.  But they must have recognized the urgency in my face, for they quickly adopted a battle stance, ready to move.
"It's a critical situation. We need to get as far away from here as possible, right now."
"But why—?"
During emergencies, actions speak louder than words. Ignoring their questions, I dashed forward. They followed suit, though unsure of the reason behind my hasty retreat. It wasn't just herd mentality; they likely believed I had a good reason for my actions.
"…Let's go!  There's gotta be a reason why Baron Yandell is acting like this!"
Thus began our unplanned escape. As they followed, they continued to bombard me with questions.
"Baron!  Just tell us what's going on! We need to know who we're running from!"
Their queries were understandable. After all, I had no answers to give.  I didn't know what exactly we needed to escape from.
"…You'll find out soon enough."
That was all I could say, so I brushed it off.
"This baron really is a pain in the neck!"
Though frustrated, my two-tailed tiger didn't stop or question my orders further. 
How much time had passed...?
"…People?"
A figure appeared at the edge of our sight.
"Not people, they're Bayons."
Dark, grimy-skinned creatures with black spiders perched on their faces.  And to our surprise, they weren't alone.
"…There's quite a number of them."
Five Bayons emerged from behind the shroud of darkness, following the one at the front.
"Baron, what do we do now?"
"We eliminate them as quickly as possible and move on."
"Got it. Everyone, remember that?"
My team, previously in formation, immediately shifted to combat mode, engaging the Bayons.
The battle itself wasn't particularly difficult.  Given the number of enemies, my two-tailed tiger didn't attack recklessly like before. Though fast, he carefully observed the Bayons, fighting strategically.
"What the hell are they doing?  Why are they using all their skills?"
"…Guardian Essence."
"What? A weakling like this has Guardian Essence?"
The Bayons we encountered this time possessed Essence far beyond our expectations, extending the battle considerably.
"Fifteen minutes..."
While it was incredibly fast for six level three monsters, the anxiety about Hans L lingered in my mind.  
"Well, at least no one got hurt…"
I wanted to resume our journey immediately after the battle, but unfortunately, my authority didn't extend that far.
"Come on, why are we leaving all this loot?  Wait here a minute.  Let's loot everything first."
My two-tailed tiger ignored my command, starting to loot the battlefield.  Even when I explained we didn't have time, he just demanded I tell him why we were in such a hurry.
"Ugh…"
I was frustrated.  I wanted to explain, but I couldn't. 
"They'll just laugh if I said it was because of Hans."
Unless they had witnessed it firsthand, experienced it for themselves...
No matter how I explained, they'd dismiss it as superstition.  And after that, they wouldn't cooperate with my irrational demands.
As I reluctantly watched them loot, two mages started a conversation.
"Six Bayons… that's unusual."
"Indeed.  Unless it's the Land of Immortality, you don't see that many of them in this area."
They were right.  Seeing so many Bayons was definitely an anomaly.  But…
"This can't be the end of it."
It was difficult to believe the Hans effect ended with just this.  After all, I've been through far worse.
"Alright, looting's done!"
My two-tailed tiger finally finished gathering the loot, and we were ready to move again.  But then someone else interrupted us.
"Wait! Everyone wait!"
렉 아우레스, the tank from the two-tailed tiger's team.  He yelled as if he had discovered something.  I tried to ignore him, assuming he would just blurt out some nonsense, but…
"Those bastards! I know their faces!"
His words demanded my attention.
***
"Briet!  Take a look!  These bastards... they're our explorers, aren't they?"
"…What do you mean?"
The archer, Briet, approached the Bayon corpse, its face torn apart, revealing the spider beneath.
And then…
"You're right.  Not all of them, but some of them look familiar."
Briet agreed with 아우레스.  Their words made the GM carefully voice a hypothesis.
"Could they be... from that Hans Deilan fellow's group?"
"…Huh?"
"You know, the story goes that they had over a hundred people with them when they set out.  Perhaps it's them..."
"Hold on, but weren't they scattered everywhere?"
아우레스 raised his doubts, but I believed it was entirely possible.  The best place to hide a lie is close to the truth.
"Hundreds remained outside the wall, that's true."
Perhaps they weren't scattered, and maybe they were caught up in some incident.  And there was proof to support this.
"I think they've been monsters for at least a few months now."
"What's that supposed to mean?"
"I don't know much about Bayons, but look at this one with the scar on its neck.  It's likely that it died from the wound and then ‘transformed’ into a monster."
"…And?"
"But the bloodstains on its chest seem to be at least a few months old."
A logical deduction, typical of a mage whose profession involves experimentation.  The old man of destruction nodded in agreement.
"Hmm... so maybe that Hans Deilan fella actually died a few months ago—."
I interrupted him mid-sentence.
"Deilan."
"…"
"Don't call him Hans. Just Deilan."
Hearing "Hans" triggered a conditioned reflex, making my body flinch involuntarily.
"You're obsessed with the weirdest things."
The old man of destruction stared at me with a mixture of amusement and irritation, but he continued his train of thought.
"Anyway, if Deilan died a few months ago and then 'transformed' into a monster, things get complicated."
"Right. It means that 'Deilan' isn't actually Deilan."
"What are you two talking about? I don't understand!"
"아우레스... simply put, someone is pretending to be 'Deilan,' luring us here."
"What?!  We've been tricked!"
Lex 아우레스 shrieked in horror, his initial reaction upon understanding 제이나's explanation.  It was nothing new, so we let him scream his head off as the two mages continued their conversation.
"If our hypothesis is correct, these Bayons aren't the end of it."
"Right… We can't be sure what's true, but if over a hundred people really did get into trouble here…"
"There might be dozens more Bayons wandering around."
As they reached that conclusion, the archer, Briet, who served as our scout, yelled loudly.
"Monsters approaching!"
"The number is five… no, six… seven, ten, fifteen…?  The number is increasing!"
Briet kept reporting the numbers as he detected them.  It didn't take long for the initial five to grow beyond thirty.
"Monster Surge! This is definitely a Monster Surge!"
A Monster Surge is a term used by explorers to describe a sudden influx of monsters...
"Hey, a sudden monster wave?"
Players often refer to this phenomenon as a monster wave.
"Briet, where did the surge start?"
"It's not a specific location.  They're coming from all directions!  It's like they're targeting us!"
It was a clear anomaly.  These Bayons, which we hadn't seen much of during our travels, had suddenly formed a pack of dozens, as if they were specifically aiming for us.
"…Did killing one of them trigger something?"
Though the details were unclear, now was the time to act, not to think.
"Even with this team, dozens of them might be too much."
"If another type of monster pops up or a meteorite hits us, we're screwed."
"Northeast direction has the fewest."
"Lead the way.  We'll try to avoid a fight."
"Yes."
We entrusted the archer, who had the widest detection range among us, with the role of navigator and followed behind.
Was it because he's a top-class scout?
"This way!"
The archer, using his wide perception, expertly navigated through the battlefield, avoiding the Bayons.
"See? Our archer's navigation is pretty good, right?"
The two-tailed tiger boasted about his teammate, making the archer blush and chuckle.
"Baiho, we were able to do it because there was an opening. But if we had stayed in that same spot and detected them late, we would've been surrounded."
The archer, Briet, spoke with humility, prompting 아우레스 to react dramatically.
"Oh, really?!  Incredible, Baron!  You said we needed to leave suddenly!"
"I'm curious too.  How did you know, Baron?"
The archer echoed his sentiment, and Baiho's eyes turned sinister.
"Hee…  Does our baron have some kind of detection skill?  Let's see… what kind of skill would be useful for a tank…"
Baiho began shadowboxing, genuinely believing I had a detection skill.
"Well, [Hyperactive Muscles] doesn't have that kind of detection effect, and it definitely isn't [The Clock Hand of Regret].  'Fate Tracker' didn't seem to react either…  What is it?"
Baiho, testing my reaction, continued throwing questions one after another.  I remained silent.  How could I explain?
It wasn't a skill, it was "Hans."  Even if I did say it, they wouldn't believe me.  It's more beneficial for me if they believe I have a different skill.
Sticking to that conclusion, I focused on escaping the Bayons' encirclement.  
How much time had passed...?
「The character has entered a special region.」
We left the Old Rock Prairie and entered a new field.
「Field effect - Toxic Lava Field activated.」
「Character's poison resistance is fixed to 0.」
「Soul Energy recovery speed reduced by 99%.」
「Warning: Beware of explosions!」
Bubbly, green lava.  Dense toxic gas like smoke.
"…They don't seem to be following us anymore."
Our scout announced the end of the pursuit, as we entered the new field.
"We made it."
"At least they're not chasing us relentlessly."
We escaped the Bayons' monster wave.  But the problem was... my warrior's heart still pounded wildly.
Thump-thump-thump!
This can't be the end of it.
