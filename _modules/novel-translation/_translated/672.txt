## Chapter 672: Stargrave (3)
The man we encountered outside the wall had told us about a dimensional tombstone. He said we could travel through it to reach a new world, very similar to the 9th Tier Stargrave, a place shrouded in mystery. 
At first, we were unsure if this place was within the labyrinth.
“I guess it’s not,” I muttered.
This area was clearly outside the walls. The evidence was everywhere: intelligent beasts with advanced abilities, and the remains of monsters after they were slain.
However, the real problem was…
“It’s impossible to return by foot,” I sighed. 
This place was effectively an island. No, it was even more isolated than that. Although it was probably located somewhere on the mainland, it was entirely surrounded by a gray border, making it impossible to venture beyond it.
In simpler terms, our chances of escaping were zero.
“…Sir Baron?” Lee Baek-ho glanced at me cautiously, his voice filled with trepidation. “What are we going to do now?”
I found his question absurd. After all, he had been trying to subtly undermine my authority, only to become completely passive when things got tough.
“It was you, Sir Baron, who told us to explore the area and look for a way out, wasn’t it?”
“I believe I said there *might* be a way out,” he retorted.
“Come on, it’s the same thing,” I scoffed. 
I was tempted to reprimand him, but I held my tongue.  After all, it was best to ignore his provocations and focus on the situation.
“Still, we gained something,” I said, trying to stay positive.
“Yes, we finally figured out we’re stuck here,” he replied with a sardonic smile. “Right?”
I wanted to punch him, but I held back, remembering my resolve and my ultimate goal –  [Star’s Extinction].
“It’s enough,” I conceded, forcing a calm tone. “We also completed the map, at least the outer edges.”
“You only drew the border. The inside is still completely empty.”
“Exactly. Now, we just need to fill in the gaps.  There’s bound to be a dimensional tombstone somewhere, leading back to our original location or another world,” I declared, my voice infused with confidence honed from countless leadership experiences.
Baek-ho, however, remained unimpressed.  
“That’s just wishful thinking,” he said, his gaze narrowed. “How do you know a dimensional tombstone even exists?”
Well…
‘Of course, it exists. This is a [Dungeon & Stone] game, after all.”
I knew this was a simplistic approach. This place was outside the walls, a part of the game I had never explored. And the reality I was experiencing differed significantly from the game.  But…
“What do you propose we do then?” I asked, my voice laced with frustration.
I wasn’t just saying this out of spite.  Even if we felt trapped in a bottomless pit, there would always be a way out, somewhere in the world. That was my unwavering belief.
“So, are we just going to sit here and wait, because you have no confidence?” I pressed him.
“That’s not what I meant—.”
“Then, just follow silently.  Even if all of you give up, I’ll find a way out,” I declared, staring directly into Baek-ho’s eyes.
He faltered, then spoke with a touch of admiration.
“Wow, Sir Baron, you have quite the tongue. Is that how you've charmed everyone so far?”
The archer, standing beside him, chimed in.
“An intriguing experience,” he said. “For a moment, I truly felt no anxiety.”
“Hah! I always knew Baron was right! We need to do something. Otherwise, we’ll just starve here!”
Aures then joined in, his booming laughter breaking the tension. The atmosphere, which had been growing tense, eased considerably. That’s why it's important to have a positive warrior in the team. Having one makes a huge difference.
“Right, let’s get going then,” I said, resuming our exploration.
***
Our primary objective now was clear: we had to scour the unexplored parts of the map, searching for a dimensional tombstone or any other means of escape. 
The problem was the sheer size of the area.  We had to be meticulous in our search.
Therefore, our approach was straightforward.
“Look around, everyone,” I instructed. “Every nook and cranny, under trees, cliffs, caves, small gaps, structures… if you see anything that looks even slightly out of place, speak up. Got it?”
The archer, Briet, who was responsible for scouting, wasn’t the only one searching meticulously.  Every member of the team, while moving, kept a vigilant eye on their surroundings.  
And whenever they found something…
“It looks like a shallow pond, but it’s incredibly deep.  It’s an ideal spot to hide something.” 
“Good, let’s stop here and investigate,” I commanded.
We used magic to scan the area and even went inside the pond to double-check.  Some complained about the extra effort, but I refused to compromise.
After all, wasn’t the dimensional tombstone ‘Daelan’ claimed to have found hidden in a difficult-to-access crevice in a cliff?  This was the only way to be certain that this place held no such tombstone.  
Only then could we start looking for alternative escape routes.
“Baron! Look at this! This seems suspicious, doesn’t it?”
“What is suspicious about it…?”
“Here! Here! The flower petals are broken!”
“Just keep moving.”
We were careful to prioritize our time, filtering out the irrelevant details.
“Why! Didn’t we agree to tell you about everything, even if it’s trivial?!” Aures complained.
"Come on, it’s just broken petals," I said, exasperated.  "What am I supposed to do with that?"
"What do I need to do to confirm it?" 
"Ruinjenes! Please,  could you take a look?"
After I ignored him, Aures started whining to the Destroyer.  It was obvious that the Destroyer wouldn't comply.
“Keep going,” he said, his voice cold.
"Ruinjenes!" 
“Let's move on.”
The search resumed, the pace slower but steady.  The map was slowly being filled in.
‘We’ve covered about 70% of the Ancient Rock Grasslands…'
The structure of the area was simple.  The ‘Primordial Land’, where we had first arrived through the portal, was the center. The ‘Ancient Rock Grasslands’ were to the west. The ‘Toxic Lava Zone’ was to the north, the ‘Dreamfall Cascade’ to the east, and the ‘Dragonbone Mountain’ to the south.
However, except for the Primordial Land, all other fields were bisected by the border of ash.
‘The biggest problem would be the Dreamfall Cascade…'
The Toxic Lava Zone and Dragonbone Mountain.  Both fields were based on the 9th Tier, making them incredibly difficult.  But they were nothing compared to the Dreamfall Cascade.
We had to meticulously search those fields, not simply pass through them, to find the dimensional tombstone.
“Human! Human traces!” 
…What?
“Indeed.  These are definitely human footprints,” the Destroyer confirmed.
Human traces had been found while we were exploring the ‘Ancient Rock Grasslands’.  And there was no way we would ignore them, especially since we were obsessed with finding suspicious things.
"Briet, you take the lead and track the traces. From now on, we move at full speed," I commanded. 
We followed the traces at our maximum speed. 
After a while…
…A lone man stood in the middle of the grassland. He was dressed in tattered and dirty clothes, as if he hadn’t washed in months.  This description alone had some similarities with ‘Daelan’, the person who lured us here…
Suddenly, the man turned around, sensing our presence.  
In that instant, we realized that he was neither Daelan nor a human.
He had a black spider crawling on his face.
“…It’s a Vayone,” I sighed.
A 3rd Tier human-shaped monster, Vayone.  It was also the origin of the [Transcendence] skill I possessed. This monster typically appeared in the ‘Land of Immortality’, one of the fields in the 7th Tier Dark Continent… 
It occasionally appeared in the 9th Tier, ‘Ancient Rock Grasslands’. 
"I thought it was Daelan," the archer said, his voice dejected.
"It was a dead end after all..."
My companions seemed disappointed, but I was secretly delighted.  
‘Finally, I found it.’
Vayone was a monster that every Shield Barbarian had to hunt.  Not only for the [Transcendence] skill, but also for the ‘Parasitic Spider’, which was a Vayone byproduct rarely found in the auction house.
“You’re lucky, Baron. This one gives 8th Tier engraving materials.”
“...”
"I envy you, Baron. You have a long way to go before you become stronger," Baek-ho said, stretching his arms.
And…
Thud!
He immediately dashed towards the Vayone. 
This was the kind of impulsive action that would irritate any leader with experience.
“Wait!”
"It's just a 3rd Tier monster,” Baek-ho said dismissively.
While it was true, Vayone was a dangerous monster.  Unlike other monsters, each Vayone’s combat power and abilities were vastly different, so the proper approach was to scout first before hunting.
Crack!
…Well, maybe it didn’t matter?
“Ah! I feel so refreshed!”
Baek-ho’s fist, infused with a black aura, pierced the Vayone’s heart.  The monster collapsed instantly. 
Simultaneously, a familiar sensation washed over me.
[You have slain a Vayone. EXP +7]
When I had slain ‘Gigazeros’, I was too overwhelmed to notice, but here, the experience points were clearly being awarded.
“Let’s see... We should loot the Baron's engraving materials first. Oh?"
Baek-ho, attempting to remove the spider from the dead Vayone’s face, suddenly froze.
"Baek-ho? What's wrong… Eek! What is this?!”
Aures’ surprised reaction, after approaching, confirmed that something unusual was happening.  I rushed to the Vayone’s corpse to investigate.
“...What?"
What is this?
The Vayone's face, revealed as the spider was removed, was as shocking to me as it was to everyone else.
"...It’s black, but... isn't this that man?"
The human-shaped monster ‘Vayone’ we had encountered in the Ancient Rock Grasslands... 
He had Daelan’s face.
***
The situation was becoming increasingly mysterious.
Daelan, who lured us here and disappeared.  Why was he now a monster, wandering this place?
“…May I ask for your opinion?” The GM asked hesitantly.
The Destroyer, with a sigh, finally responded.
“I’m not sure, but I recall reading about this in an ancient book. Vayone are supposed to be ancient explorers who died within the labyrinth.”
It was information I already knew. I had been studying game lore, hoping to find clues about hidden pieces.
"Ah! So, it’s why Vayone use essence, just like explorers!"
"That's what it says, but it's not a very credible story. It’s probably just a legend for entertainment," the Destroyer said, dismissing it.
“...Is that so?”
We were in uncharted territory.  We had to understand this situation.
I snatched the loot from Baek-ho, my curiosity getting the better of me.  It was important, but so was this.
‘Only one more thing to collect...’
The only thing left to complete my 8th Tier engraving was…
‘Maybe I can get it using the properties of this place…'
But, encountering a rare monster like Vayone in this place, with its low monster population, was a stroke of good fortune. 
“Oh! It really is Daelan! I found his ID card in his pocket!”  Aures shouted, his voice filled with excitement.  
He held a business card-sized ID card in his hand.
“Let’s see, the name is… ”
Thump…
“Hans…? Ah! That's right! It’s Hans!”
Thump!
My heart started racing.  I made a swift decision.
“Prepare to move!” 
We had to get out of this place. 
As quickly as possible.
