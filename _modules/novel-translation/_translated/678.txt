##  Dream (5)
The unbroken dream continues.
“Oppa, I came to see you again today.”
Hyunbyeol visited almost every day, sharing stories with me.
“I looked into ways to help you regain your senses. Honestly, I wasn’t sure if I’d find anything… but I was incredibly lucky. I found something.”
In this dream-like world, Hyunbyeol hadn’t been dragged into the game. After hearing news of me from her mother, she regularly came to help me.
Just like this.
“It’s a discharged soldier named Lee Baekho. I posted on the [Dungeon and Stone] community you used to frequent, and somehow, he was found.”
“When I asked if I could talk to him, he asked me if I was a woman first? When I said yes, he agreed to meet. His behavior, the way he acts, it’s just… he’s a bit obsessed with women.”
“Oh, I got sidetracked. Anyway, the important thing is that he hasn’t been sucked into the game either. Uh… are you disappointed?”
Disappointed? Why would I be?
I had already anticipated this.
In this dream world, no one who had been dragged into the game existed.
That was why I had sent that letter to my Canadian friend.
I had started to wonder if I was truly going crazy.
But thankfully, the results came back yesterday.
No matter how much they drugged me, and no matter how much they tortured me…
I’m not crazy.
This place feels too real, too vivid to be just a dream, but…
This place is a dream world.
It’s a bit awkward to say, but it's also a very advantageous situation for me.
‘Thinking about it now, the police were strange.’
No matter how much they treated me as a crazy person, I managed to escape their clutches. And yet, Chief Kang still comes to visit occasionally, offering his well-wishes and encouraging me to get better.
And that's not all.
“Oppa, when you get better, let’s go to Namsan together. You used to like the night view there.”
Hyunbyeol, despite us being mere ex-lovers, is showering me with an abundance of kindness.
“Hansoo… it’s my fault, it’s all my fault. If I had just acted differently, you wouldn’t have become like this…”
My mother, who used to be my Achilles' heel, is the same.
She constantly spews out words that I may have secretly wished to hear deep down inside.
Is this truly a dream world?
‘Maybe that’s why.’
Looking back, maybe this was more influential than the drugs or anything else.
The fact that I believed this was reality, and that I was the one who was crazy.
People are like that, aren’t they? Once you lie on an electric blanket, you just want to stay there forever.
‘But I need to wake up now.’
With the letter from my Canadian friend as my support, I rekindled my waning resolve and began to devise an escape plan.
I mapped out the hospital, analyzing the tendencies and schedules of the staff.
All while pretending to be improving, lulling them into a false sense of security.
I was diligently making preparations when…
“Hansoo, I actually haven’t said this to anyone, including you, but… I believe what you said could be true.”
Chief Kang, who had come for a routine visit, threw a completely unexpected statement at me.
It was a bit of a difficult situation for me, who was pretending to be getting better.
“Excuse me? That’s all made-up. I genuinely believe that now…”
“I’m sorry… I kept wondering if it was the right time to say this, now that you seem to be improving. But… could you please watch this video, just this once?”
Chief Kang asked me with a pleading tone and pulled out his phone, playing a video that was saved on it.
‘What is this…?’
The video was filmed at the police station where I had been questioned previously.
The camera focused on a monitor placed on the desk…
“Do you see? The characters on this monitor.”
The monitor displayed unknown logs.
The video quality wasn’t good enough to read the characters clearly, but thankfully, Chief Kang read them for me.
“Synchronization completed.”
“Character information and log are being recorded and sent to the administrator.”
“Adult ceremony successfully completed, new equipment equipped, overall item level increased… There were tons of game messages like these, densely packed. They were even updating in real time.”
“Sometimes character information would be displayed, and the character’s name was ‘Bjorn Jandel.’ That’s the same name you mentioned.”
I had decided that this place was a dream and was busy devising an escape plan. Now I was faced with a sudden situation that made me wonder what was going on.
“But… so what? What does that mean?”
I asked with furrowed brows, and Chief Kang replayed the paused video.
“Could you please look carefully at the surroundings of the monitor? Yes, right here. As you can see… there are no cables connected to the monitor. There’s no main unit, and the power cord isn’t plugged in at all.”
Well… that’s true, isn’t it?
My mind went into a state of confusion.
What does this mean?
“This situation is scientifically inexplicable. Because of this, I started to wonder if what you said was really true.”
“… So you’re saying I’m not crazy?”
“No, I still don’t know. But one thing is certain… the situation is highly suspicious.”
“Suspicious?”
I tilted my head in confusion, and Chief Kang looked around before lowering his voice.
“This monitor, shortly after we took it from each other, went missing from the evidence room.”
“….”
“As if someone deliberately destroyed the evidence.”
What the hell is going on?
***
Chief Kang’s words threw me into a state of confusion.
I had finally come to fully believe that this world was a dream, but now he shows me this video?
What is real, and what is fake?
Maybe they showed me this because I refused to believe this place was real, to make me believe?
‘No, then wouldn’t it have been easier to just prevent the Canadian friend from responding?’
Resolving one contradiction only led to another.
My head started to ache, but I decided to keep things simple.
Ultimately, belief is what matters.
And I can choose.
What I choose to believe.
‘The execution date is four days from now….’
I had finally finished my escape plan and even set a date.
On that day, I will escape this hospital and go outside.
Then I will have to figure out how to escape this dream.
‘I have a feeling the answer lies within [Dungeon and Stone]….’
Of course, this is just my assumption, nothing is certain.
But the fact that the hospital allows everything except [Dungeon and Stone] is suspicious.
Of course, they did have a reason—that it might interfere with my treatment.
‘Maybe re-clearing [Dungeon and Stone] is the trigger.’
It’s definitely worth a try.
The most important thing is to succeed in my escape on the first attempt…
‘Just in case, maybe one more time.’
I continued to run simulations, checking for any flaws, even while waiting for the execution date.
And…
One day, two days, three days.
The day before the execution date.
“Mr. Lee Hansoo! A visitor!”
Someone visited the hospital where I was admitted.
Hyunbyeol, my mother, Chief Kang.
I assumed it would be one of the three, but when I went to see, it was a completely unknown old man.
He was Caucasian.
Dressed in a suit, reminiscent of a gentleman.
He carried an elegant walking stick that didn’t look like a weapon.
‘Just because he’s carrying a walking stick doesn’t mean he’s a magician.’
I analyze people when I meet them for the first time.
A habit I picked up in Lapdonia.
“You must be Hansoo.”
Surprisingly, the elderly man, who appeared to be pure Caucasian, spoke to me in Korean without any hesitation.
I thought the young man behind him was an interpreter.
Is he just an assistant?
I don’t know, but one thing is certain.
“Yes, but… who are you, sir?”
Something about him just felt off.
Why would a person like this come to see me?
He looks rich and prestigious.
The fact that someone completely unrelated to me could visit me in the hospital raises suspicions.
Swish.
The Caucasian old man took off his fedora, which had been hiding his face, and placed it on the table.
His face, previously hidden, was now revealed.
No more introductions were needed.
“I am Auril Gaviss.”
Thump.
“I’m also the one who created the [Dungeon and Stone] you played.”
I never thought this old man would appear.
Is this how it goes because the concept is ‘dreams’? The development is completely unpredictable.
“But let me tell you.”
The old man’s sharp eyes, unreadable in their depth, were fixed on me.
Something about them just felt overwhelming.
“It seems you already knew who I was.”
Well, whether it’s the other world or this one, you can’t hide anything from this old man.
“Looks like you saw another me over there, didn’t you?”
“Another me…?”
“Hmm, you couldn’t figure that out, huh?”
Is it because I'm too used to modern life?
The moment I heard the old man lick his lips, my entire body was awakened to old sensations.
I’d better be on my toes, or I’ll get screwed.
Right, so…
“Cut to the chase.”
I lowered my voice and met his deep eyes directly. The old man smiled, a smile that seemed to show satisfaction.
“I’m the only one who knows you’re not crazy. And I have the ability to help you escape from here.”
“….”
“But you don’t seem surprised by this… It seems you’ve already planned your escape.”
Damn, this old man knows how to subtly probe like it’s nothing.
“Cut to the chase.”
I lowered my voice further, speaking with a firm tone. The old man slowly nodded.
Finally, he gets to the point.
“I’ll ask you directly.”
The old man had one question for me.
“Did you meet that child?”
“Who’s that child?”
I feigned ignorance, despite having a hunch, and the old man shook his head.
“… Never mind. I’ll change the question.”
What is this? Why is he making me curious?
“How did you come back? The Abyss Gate hasn’t opened, has it?”
“…If you made it this far, you must have already investigated.”
“Ah, you mean the records you told the police and doctors? I’ve already confirmed those—.”
The old man, who had been talking calmly, suddenly shut his mouth and burst into a fit of laughter.
“Ha-ha-ha! A-ha-ha-ha-ha!”
“….”
“Are you really convinced that this world is a dream world?”
I wanted to refuse to answer because it sounded like he was mocking me. But if I just kept my mouth shut, I wouldn’t get any information.
“You don’t seem to think so, do you?”
“Hansoo, no matter what you believe, this is definitely reality. It’s different from where you were.”
“Different from where I was? What does that mean?”
“This world doesn’t have what you call ‘cheat mode.’ That’s why you were the only one who could open the Abyss Gate and cross over to Lapdonia. But…,”
The old man trailed off, then continued.
“That doesn’t mean this isn’t real.”
“Believe it or not, everything here is real. Your mother, who begs for your forgiveness, your dedicated ex-lover.”
‘Believe it or not’ is an understatement—it’s completely unbelievable.
“Then… show me the evidence.”
I took a bold stance, but the old man only chuckled and shook his head.
“No, that’s not necessary.”
“Is it because you don’t have any evidence to show?”
I gently prodded him, but I didn’t get the reaction I was expecting.
“Believe whatever you want. Aren’t you convinced that this is a dream world? If you want to go back, there’s no need to persuade you.”
Damn, he’s pulling this on me now?
My stress levels skyrocketed, but I couldn’t just punch him because I was about to escape.
“Then I’ll be going. Good luck.”
The old man stood up, as if he were truly done with his business.
Of course, I could just let him go…
“Wait.”
Something about him just felt unsettling. I stopped him.
“Is there something you need to say?”
Well, I didn’t stop him because I needed something. I just didn’t want to let him go just like that.
Since I was already at it, I might as well ask this.
“What’s the way to wake up from this dream?”
“Hmm?”
“If you really want me to go back, why don’t you just tell me?”
The old man stared at me, then chuckled once more.
“I do want you to go back.”
“… What?”
“If I want you to go back, it will happen, whether you want it or not. But the fact that you’re still here…”
“….”
“It seems you’ve come to like this place, despite what you say.”
What’s he talking about? I’m dying to get back right now.
“Ah, I’ll take care of the hospital and the police matter. So you can do whatever you want.”
No matter what he says, I’m not getting confused.
