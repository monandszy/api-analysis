## Chapter 18: Laphdonia (2)
Back at the inn, I scrutinized Erwen's slightly intoxicated form.  Of course, I never broke the oath I had sworn to her sister. What would that oath even mean to me, a warrior in body only?
"Erwen, stretch your arms a bit more."
"Ugh, but even if you ask so…."
I was forcibly stretching Erwen.
"Ouch! My shoulder! I think it's going to dislocate!"
"Hmm."
"I, I can't bend it this far normally! I swear!"
"Are you sure?"
"Yes, yes! On my clan's honor!"
As soon as she relaxed her arms, Erwen flopped onto the bed.
"Even with +4 to flexibility, it's not that noticeable."
Well, that's the same in the game, isn't it?
"Anything, anything else?"
"No, rest for now."
[Dungeon & Stone] was a game that offered little in terms of explanations. Even the stats are a case in point:
Body, Mind, Ability.
These were the main stats, but clicking the [+] button beside them revealed thousands of sub-stats.  For example, increasing Strength, a sub-stat of Body, would increase the character's weight capacity, physical attack power, and so on.
Flexibility?
It slightly increased evasion and critical hit rate.
Sight?
It increased the range of ranged weapons and the character's visibility range.
Smell became a coefficient for related abilities, while Accuracy simply affected accuracy.
Therefore, even if two characters had the same Body stat of 50, their abilities could be vastly different depending on their sub-stats.
"…"
I had figured all of this out myself.  The game company, nor any overseas players, had ever revealed this information.  I had to conduct countless experiments and compile statistical data, all for the sole reason of wanting to clear this game.
Damn, I never imagined back then that my passion would turn into such a bitter poison.
'Ugh, I'm getting heated up again.'
To get back to the topic, I was a seasoned veteran with nine years of experience. However, there were still a few stats whose effects I couldn't figure out.  "Obsession +7," displayed on the essence I had taken from the goblin archer, was the prime example. 
Apart from it being a sub-stat of Mind, everything about Obsession was a mystery.
"Erwen."
"I get nervous whenever you sigh. Can't we just not talk?"
"Did anything change about you after we left the dungeon?  Have you been feeling something constantly in your mind? Something that makes it hard to resist?"
"…I, I don't know? Maybe?"
"What is it? Tell me."
"Snacks…? Yes, snacks. Now that I think about it, I bought so many right after we came out…."
"Did you dislike sweets before?"
"No, I liked them? But I've never eaten this much in a day."
"I see."
Perhaps obsession meant a heightened desire.  So, that's probably why it had no significant effect in the game.
My head started to spin. Maybe other sub-stats had additional effects in this real-world patch.  Flexibility was a prime example. As it was in the game, natural movements made evading easier. If the situation called for it, I could potentially pull off maneuvers that I couldn't before, resulting in a critical hit.
But is that all?
Increased flexibility would make it easier to enter narrow spaces, and the impact of landing would be less severe compared to a stiff body. These were things I couldn't know in the game. Therefore, I needed to re-evaluate my training methods, taking those aspects into account.
"I'm sleepy…."
Oh, did I let her rest too much? Her eyes are already half-closed. I wanted to check if she had any difficulties using active skills, and how long it would take her to use them again…
"Alright, go to sleep."
"Okay…."
I blew out the fire. Then, I lay down beside Erwen. 
She didn't think anything of it, and neither did I. It was funny, after everything we saw together in the dungeon, that we'd be acting awkwardly now.
*Snoring!*
I fell asleep, but then my eyes started to flutter closed again.  The words my sister had told me before I left, not to sleep with her, came to mind.
Well, no need to worry about it.
She probably didn't mean it that way, anyway.

[07 : 35]
I woke up rather early.  Well, I guess 'early' is an exaggeration, considering I had been sleeping almost non-stop for two days.
"Water…."
Erwen had just woken up, too.  We did a quick wash and had a light breakfast on the first floor. Then, we headed towards Erwen's inn. The city was so large that it took over an hour to walk.
"It's a good thing we're in the same district!"
I agree. If it were on the opposite end of the city, we would have had to take a carriage for a long time.  It's called a fortress city, but Laphdonia is truly massive.
"You have to keep a low profile here, okay?  You and my sister are the only ones who know about what happened with you."
"I will."
We waited in an alleyway three blocks away from the inn.  Erwen came walking, struggling under two heavy backpacks. Those were the backpacks of the leader and the crossbow user who had ambushed us before the end of day 7. They were so stuffed that they wouldn't even close, with weapons sticking out.
"I'll carry them."
"Oh, thank you!"
She still doesn't know how to say no.  It's not like that at first.
"Put the weapons here, the armor here, and organize the tools and consumables separately."
"Yes!"
Back at the inn, we spent some time sorting and checking the items from the backpacks. It took about an hour, but it was quite enjoyable.  After all, it was loot, wasn't it? 
Erwen and I sat side by side on the bed, looking at the neatly arranged items on the floor.
"Are you going to sell everything?"
"Except what I need."
"Then, can I keep the leather armor and belt you gave me?"
"It's fine.  Just deduct it from your share."
"Okay, please!"
Having sorted the items into what we would sell and what we would keep, we headed back out into the city.  We decided to share the consumables, like potions and exploration equipment, except for duplicate tools, like compasses and watches.  But most of the equipment was going to be sold.  It's better to buy something else with the money than to use something that doesn't fit.  And we're not exactly strapped for cash anymore.
"This is it!"
We arrived at a weapons shop Tercia had recommended.  We had a katana, two broadswords, a crossbow, a two-handed hammer, two daggers, and three pocket knives to sell.
"That's a total of 350,000 stones."
I had been worried because it was a referral from an acquaintance, but this shop offered the best price compared to all the others we checked, so we just sold everything.
"Wow…."
As soon as we left the shop, Erwen let out a suppressed exclamation.  I was feeling the same way.
"This isn't a dream, is it?"
Excluding the gem stones we had taken, we had only earned about 100,000 stones from pure hunting over the past seven days.  But 350,000 stones?  And we haven't even sold the armor yet.
…Now I understand why those explorer bastards got greedy over every person they saw.
Equipment, it's money.  A lot of it.
"How much is my share?"
Erwen's eyes were filled with greed for money.
"Wait, we have a lot more to sell."
Our next destination was the armor shop, 10 minutes away.
"That's 180,000 stones."
We had more pieces of armor, but it was worth less than the weapons.  It's understandable since armor is harder to sell as used goods and the purchase price is lower.  We decided to sell all of it, too, because of the size issue, didn't we?
"I'll sell them at that price."
"You're a real barbarian, so decisive.  If you get any more of these items, come back again.  I'll offer you a good price then, too."
"I will."
After visiting a general store to sell several unneeded items, we ended up with a whopping 1,450,000 stones.  Well, it's not all mine.
"Take this, 45,000 stones."
"Huh? Isn't that a bit much?"
I had deducted 20,000 stones for the leather armor and belt, and added another 7,000 stones.  I'm not giving it to her because she's cute. It's the amount I calculated based on the gems that the lanky guy and the samurai had.
"I don't know the exact amount, so I used the other two you gave me as a reference."
"Oh, I see! Thank you!"
Anyway, after deducting everything, our total assets amounted to 1,400,000 stones.  It's a bit…  no, very strange.  I had rarely had this much money during my first playthrough in the game…
This is a good start.
"So, I'm off."
"What?"
Why are you making that face?  We've settled the money, it's time for us to go our separate ways.  I have a lot to do now because of you and your plans messed things up.
"Well, we can go together until the central plaza."
"Okay…."
Erwen suddenly stopped talking.  We walked along the street, and eventually arrived at the central plaza, a junction.
"Huh? It's gotten so crowded all of a sudden."
Unlike when we passed by earlier, the plaza was bustling.  Half of the crowd was soldiers, and the other half was prisoners bound in ropes.  Or maybe, not prisoners.
"Mmph! Ugh! Ugh!"
They weren't criminals like murderers, rapists, or arsonists.  The prisoners had their mouths gagged, their eyes filled with fear.  Their crimes? ‘Tax evasion’.  In other words, they had no money.  The young woman in her twenties, the man who looked like he was old enough to have children, the old man with wrinkled hands who had probably lived his whole life working harder than anyone… they were all condemned to death.
"The execution will now commence!"
As the tax collector shouted, soldiers dragged the man towards the guillotine.  Then…
*Screech*!
The severed head of the man fell with a chilling sound, landing in the wooden barrel displayed in front.  Some people in the crowd took their bread, dipped it in the blood that had spilled, and ate it greedily.
"Hic!"
Erwen hiccuped at the brutal spectacle that unfolded before her.  
"What, what is this? Who are those people? Why are they dipping bread in blood?"
"There's a superstition that drinking the blood of someone executed by the tax collector brings good fortune."
Erwen frowned, completely perplexed.  It seemed she was more shocked by that than by the man's head being chopped off.
"Erwen, how much is the first-year tax?"
"For non-humans, it's 700,000 stones."
"I see."
It was 600,000 stones in the game.  There's a slight difference, but it's pretty much the same.
"But you don't have to worry, do you? You earned more than that."
Huh?  Well, that's true…
But it's not something a girl with her sister's backing should be saying.  Besides, I don't plan on saving this money for next year's taxes anyway.
It's simple.
"Erwen, how much is the tax from the second year onwards?"
"800,000 stones.  And you have to pay a conversion fee when you exchange your gems."
Taxes keep increasing until you reach a certain level. So, now is the time to invest in myself.  The first year, with its exemption from conversion fees and comparatively lower taxes, is the best time to grow exponentially.
"Aaack! Pl, please, spare me!"
"Put the gag back on properly!"
"Next month! Next month, I can pay— mmph, ugh! Ugh!"
Anyway, it's a good thing…
Humans rely heavily on visual information, don't they? 
*Screech*!
Seeing it with my own eyes, the reality hits hard.  
Returning to the original world.
I should set more concrete intermediate goals than this unrealistic objective.  
For example, assuming my lifespan is 90 years.  
If I couldn't find a way to go home and had to spend the rest of my life here…
'How much money would I need?'
Well, I need to do some calculations.  A house with a kitchen, medical care when I'm sick, and enough money to live comfortably after retirement at 50, with maybe three dogs…
"The sixth floor."
I'd have to save like crazy from at least the sixth floor until my retirement.
That's it, I need to—
"What did you just say?"
"Nothing."
I need to get to at least the sixth floor.
Whether I can go home or not…
That's a problem for later.
