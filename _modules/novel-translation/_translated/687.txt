## Chapter 687: Mystery (1)
[Dungeon & Stone] is a hardcore game. Even without making any significant mistakes, players often lose their meticulously developed characters throughout the game.  Therefore, this wasn't particularly surprising news.
Layton Briet, the archer of the Baekho team, had died. It was a perfectly plausible event considering he had battled the true dragon and was subsequently teleported to random coordinates.  Surviving alone on the 9th layer is never easy, especially with injuries.  Even Jeina Flyer, the healer, would have perished if she hadn't luckily encountered me.  
However...
"………Excuse me?"
Hearing this news abruptly, I couldn't help but feel bewildered.
"W-What do you mean…?  You’re saying Mr. Briet is dead…?"
When the GM inquired again with a shocked expression, the Doom Old Man, seemingly unfazed, continued with a flat voice, stating the facts.
"I found his body on the way here. It seems this area was too harsh for him to survive alone after pushing himself to the limit."
"S-So…."
The GM couldn't say a word about the news of their teammate's death.  It was ironic.  The Doom Old Man, who had been with them for a much longer time than I, seemed completely indifferent.
"Anyway, since Briet is dead, Baekho is the only one who can carry the cloth and deliver the news.  That's my conclusion."
"Y-Yes…."
"Enough about Briet, what's the situation here? What is this structure?"
"W-We don't know. When we arrived, this was just… suddenly here."
"Hmm, very interesting."
As I watched the Doom Old Man, his eyes gleaming, approach the structure, I closed my eyes for a moment of silence. 
'Layton Briet….'
Judging from his time spent with Baekho, he wasn't a good guy.  Still, I should offer my condolences.  In this desolate labyrinth, a little bit of sentimentality wouldn't hurt.
"Mr. Briet always wanted to quit."
Startled by the sudden voice, I turned my head and saw Jeina.
"He got his wish. Now he doesn't have to do anything."
What is this?  Is she a psychopath too?
The thought flickered through my mind, but seeing Jeina's expression, I couldn't help but chuckle.  Her words, laced with sarcasm, felt like a form of mourning, albeit a peculiar one.
"Your comrades are lucky.  They have someone who'll grieve for them when they die."
"So, why don't you defect already?"
At my playful suggestion, Jeina paused for a moment before smiling softly and replying.
"That's not possible.  I need a lot of sacrifices."
"You can just kill raiders or Noarks to solve your 'sacrifice' problem."
"…….You do know I'm talking about the Noarks, right?"
Oh, you're right.
"Thanks, but I'll pass."
Whatever.  I wasn't being serious anyway.  
If the truth about me having a priest of Karui as a clan member were to be revealed, it would make the 'Three God Church' my enemy.  That's a situation I absolutely cannot afford, especially considering the royal family is already a headache.
'All I need now is Rex Aurelius and Baekho.'
The Doom Old Man and the GM began investigating the new anomaly, while the rest of us waited on standby.  And then...
One day, two days…
On the third day, Rex Aurelius appeared.  He looked like a complete wreck, beyond the point of being described as ragged.
"H-Ha, ha… I-I'm alive…."
His appearance alone spoke volumes about the hardships he endured over those days.  As soon as he spotted us, Aurelius collapsed into a deep sleep, and Jeina, with a gentle hand, treated him.  Then...
"So, you weren't the one who carried the cloth…."
"I'm ashamed to admit, it was me.  I barely escaped the monsters and stepped onto the land of the ancients, and then, bang—."
"Enough."
Interrupting Rex Aurelius' likely lengthy explanation, I shared a look with the others.
"……Doesn't it seem strange?  It's clear Baekho delivered the news by carrying the cloth, yet he's nowhere to be seen."
"It is a bit odd.  I thought he might be delivering the news to other areas for the first few days, but…."
"I also think it's reasonable to assume he would have returned at least once by now to check the situation."
With Rex Aurelius joining us, the mystery deepened.  If neither Rex Aurelius nor anyone else had carried the cloth, then there was only Baekho left.  But where is he, and what is he doing?
As we discussed this, the Doom Old Man offered a possibility.
"Perhaps Baekho entered here first."
The Doom Old Man pointed his finger at the newly appeared structure on the left side of the monument.  It looked like an entrance to anyone.  We had been diligently investigating it from the outside, but we still don't know what lies beneath. 
We decided to wait until everyone was present before making a decision, but...
"Indeed... Baekho might have entered alone.  He might have said he'd check for a moment before we arrive."
"……That's impossible, but it wouldn't surprise me if he actually did it."
The rest of the team nodded in agreement, understanding the Doom Old Man's explanation.  However, the Doom Old Man shook his head.
"No, it's definitely strange.  I may not know how Baekho appears to you, but I know him as the most cautious person I know."
"……What?"
"He might seem confident, but Baekho is terrified of anything reckless.  Sometimes, he's so scared, it drives me crazy."
"……You mean Baekho?"
"Being confident and being cautious are completely different things."
"But didn't you say he might have entered there, Master Ruin Genesis?"
"That's right.  We don't have any other explanation, so we're using the process of elimination.  But if Baekho, who's so cautious, actually did enter there... then there must be a specific reason.  That's what I think."
Hmm...
"What do you think, Bjorn Yandel?"
My head was spinning.  If the Doom Old Man's theory was true, then entering that structure would mean it's difficult to get out.  It makes sense.  If he could freely come and go, Baekho would have returned at least once by now.
"Let's wait one more day and decide."
The next day passed, but Baekho still didn't show up.  It was time to make a decision.
"Havellion, do you have any idea what might be down there?"
I looked down at the stairs obscured by the darkness, and the GM shook his head.
"I've never heard of anything like this existing in the land of the ancients."
"Yeah, I know…."
I felt the same way.  Not only the land of the ancients, but I had never seen this kind of entrance in the entire Star Burial Ground.  It was incredibly suspicious, appearing suddenly when it wasn't there before.
However…
"Alright, I've decided."
"You're going in?"
"Yeah."
I never intended to stay out.  After all, I had searched the entire Star Burial Ground, risking danger, to find something 'suspicious'.  Now that it’s right here, there’s no way I'm passing it up.
"I was going to wait for Baekho longer, but since he's not showing up, there's nothing we can do.  Let’s just enter.  He might be inside, anyway."
Let's go in.
***
I decided to think of this as a kind of dungeon.  There must be some unknown mechanics and traps that we have to avoid.
Carefully, I descend into the narrow staircase.  I'm leading the way, with Rex Aurelius in the rear.  Our formation has the long-range fighters positioned in the middle.
One step, another step, I tread carefully.  This is the nature of a dungeon without information.  In the game, the first trial always involves acquiring information, and unexplored areas are always dangerous.
As a precaution, all five of us have ropes tied around our waists, making a sort of fish formation.  The ropes, by the way, are secured to stakes at the entrance like they do for rock climbing…
"Whoa! Big trouble! Big trouble!"
A loud yell comes from the back, just after we descend a few steps.
"The rope broke!"
"……What?"
"It's not my fault! I didn't do anything! I was just following—!"
"It doesn't seem like a lie.  Looking at the cross-section, it looks like it was cut by something sharp..."
"Everyone, huddle closer to the wall."
We squeeze past each other and climb back up the narrow stairs to check the rope's cross-section.  It doesn't seem like Aurelius did anything wrong.  Besides, there’s no way a magically engineered rope designed to extend hundreds of meters could break by accident.
"Go slowly."
We need to investigate what happened, so we stop our descent and climb back up to the top of the stairs.  But...
"Aren't we much higher than where we were before…?"
"Yes. We've descended 213 stairs, but we've already climbed more than 240."
No matter how many stairs we climb, we can't see the outside.  Simply put, the way back is gone.
"……Big trouble! We're trapped!"
"Don't be a drama queen. We all knew this was a possibility."
"R-Really?"
Jeina scolds Rex Aurelius, while the GM approaches me.
"We've confirmed there's no way back, so how about we continue our descent?"
It was reasonable advice, but I felt a sense of unease.  Or rather, not unease, but...
'The entrance disappears when you descend, and you can’t go back because you’re met with endless stairs...'.
A sense of déjà vu washes over me. There is a place like this in a rift, a place called 'Golden Ruins'.  There was this similar set up at the entrance of that place, one of the rifts on the 4th layer.
'The walls also look similar...'
If this place is based on 'Golden Ruins', then going down isn't the answer.  There's a piece hidden here, too.  If you keep climbing the stairs even after the entrance is closed, you'll encounter a special event.
'I don't know what's behind it, but we should probably trigger the event first.'
Of course, there’s no guarantee the event will happen here.  But trying it out wouldn't hurt except for maybe a little time.
"We're going to keep climbing, so follow carefully and don't get separated."
"Yes, but…."
"Let's go."
I continued to climb the stairs, step by step, at a fast pace.  Then...
"How long do you plan to climb? There's only stairs, and no end."
"Turning back will be a pain, too."
We've probably climbed about half of the way by now.
As I climb step by step, a strange sound reaches my ears, and I hurriedly order the group to stop.
"Stop."
"Oh, you're turning back—"
"Quiet."
"……?"
"Someone is coming down from the front."
I don't know who it is, of course.  This isn't how the special event is supposed to happen.
'Who… could it be?'
I don't know, but since there's a chance for a fight, I signal an alert.  And then…
"……."
"……."
The sound of approaching footsteps stops abruptly.
'Did they also notice us?'
The air feels stiff, tense as a tightly pulled string.
Gulp-
I swallow unconsciously, tightening my grip on the shield, when suddenly…
Thud-!
The sound of a sudden rush reaches my ears.
"Prepare for battle!!"
I shout, breaking the tense silence.  Something charges from the darkness.  As I instinctively prepare my shield, my body freezes.
Thump-
Two feet stop in front of the shield, having just been sprinting towards us.
"Surprise! Did I scare you?"
Seeing the boy grinning innocently in front of me, I let out a long sigh.
'Is this kid crazy?'
It was Baekho. 
***
I’m still trying to decide whether I should punch him or not, when Baekho starts to giggle and poke my side repeatedly.
"Haha! Did I scare you? I did!  You looked so scared! Are you okay? You looked so scared!"
"…Even jokes have a time and place."
"Aw, how can I resist?  I’m finally reunited with my precious comrades!"
"……."
"No, but seriously, I didn’t expect you to be inside.  How could you not wait for me and just go in?"
……What?
"The Baron wouldn't—."
"……What did you just say?"
I growl, and Baekho looks at me with a puzzled expression, seemingly sensing something is off.  I quickly confirm something.
"This is important, so answer seriously, no jokes. Did you tie the cloth to the tree...?"
It was something I was almost certain of until this moment.  
However, Baekho frowns, tilting his head, in response to my question.
"What are you talking about? That cloth…  wasn’t it the Baron who put it up…?"
That response sent chills down my spine.
'……If it wasn't Baekho.'
Then who told us to come here?
