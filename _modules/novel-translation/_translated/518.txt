## The Rift (518)
Hipramajeont. The village chief's estimated rank was 2. Three confirmed abilities. The two less significant ones didn't matter much.
"A [Gigantification] ability on a monster with 2-rank stats…?"
How could I resist?
Right now, what mattered wasn't just the ability itself, but the inherent ability it might possess. In other words, its passive skill.
If even the passive skill was something useful to me…
"I might be able to take the Orc Hero's essence and devour it."
Unfortunately, even the books lacked any record of its passive. 
Of course, it made sense. They hadn't even managed to capture it, escaping instead. It would have been difficult to confirm its passive. 
"My sleep is completely gone."
As I went through various possibilities, spinning my hopeful gears, another thought suddenly struck me.
"But what happens if I devour two essence cores with the same skill? Does only one activate? Or can I not consume them at all?"
Hmm, I felt like it would be the former.
But if two of the same skill could be used simultaneously, that would be incredibly fun.
To avoid succumbing to excessive optimism, I began to analyze the negative possibilities. One major problem remained.
"Besides the fact that it's estimated to be rank 2, I have no way of knowing if it even produces an essence core."
That was a peculiar characteristic of this layer.
The beasts here fall into two categories. Ordinary monsters, which yield both a magic stone and an essence core, and monsters whose corpses vanish after being slain. 
The two species engage in deadly combat when they encounter each other. This characteristic explains why the population plummets after the rainy season ends, around three days after the rain ceases.
"It was said that everywhere you look, there are magic stone fields."
This species survives by gathering those magic stones and transforming them into Life Essence to drink.
"Ah, I've been lost in thought for too long."
I'll think about Hipramajeont later, for now, I need to focus on reading.
"I can't believe there are so many new monsters."
The monsters I've encountered so far were just the tip of the iceberg.
From the creatures that appear during the 'rainy season' to those that float onto the islands on the waves, there are countless varieties.
"I might forget, so I should copy everything down separately after reading."
How long had I been sitting at my desk, engrossed in the book? I sensed a presence near the door.
"Bjorn..."
"Misha? Didn't you go out with Emily?"
"We just got back... We finished."
I checked my watch, and realized how much time had flown by.
"You did? Why didn't you tell me earlier? If I knew you were back, I would have immediately closed the book and come out."
"That woman... said to leave you alone. Said you were busy and shouldn't be disturbed..."
"Emily?"
"...Yes."
Misha nodded and cautiously opened her mouth.
"If it's alright with you, could we… talk for a bit?"
"Of course."
I set the book aside and turned around, ready to engage in a conversation.  When a team member comes looking for you alone, it means there's a reason.
"Did something happen?"
"...Not really."
"Huh? Then why?"
"It's just... I thought we hadn't really had a proper conversation since we met again..."
"Ah..."
I opened my mouth without realizing, and Misha murmured in a wistful tone.
"You're asking why I came, aren't you?"
I felt a pang in my chest, but I had something to say too.
"It was you who suggested we become teammates that day, remember?"
Even after we reunited, it was Misha who drew the line. So I didn't make any effort to cross it. Relationships with long gaps require time.
"Yes... I did..."
Misha simply ended the conversation there, with that single, dismissive reply.
An oppressive silence settled in, suffocating me. Eventually, it was me who spoke first.
"...Is there anything uncomfortable?"
This was a signal that we should end this topic. Misha, in a performative, cheerful voice, replied.
"Oh, yes... It's just a little strange... You know?"
I understood. 
Floating debris on the sea, beasts claiming to be human, creatures raining from the sky. And even a fellow adventurer trapped in a labyrinth with the great sage. 
It would be only natural to feel strange, experiencing such bizarre wonders in the first discovered layer.
"Being back here… in the labyrinth… with you."
Ah, wasn't this topic over?
But even though that thought crossed my mind, I didn't interrupt her. 
"I mean, don't worry too much. It's just… strange. It's not that I'm uncomfortable. It's just that it's hard to adjust… It was unimaginable just a few months ago… This situation, I mean."
She glanced at me, as if trying to gauge my reaction.
I chuckled and replied.
"Don't worry, I'm not worried."
Misha laughed softly. 
"What do you mean?"
"It's not just a saying, it's true. Compared to Erwen, you're nothing."
Ah, how terrifying that time was? 
Things have gotten a bit better now, but Amelia and I still bicker and fight all the time.
"So stop being nervous and just do whatever you want. Everyone gets close by fighting, that's how it works."
I decided to share some stories about Erwen and Amelia, but for some reason, it got cut off halfway.
"Emily and Erwen actually fought a lot—."
"But what's that book?"
"Huh? Oh, this… The village chief wrote it. It's a record of the monsters he encountered while living on this island."
"Oh, right? That's good. It'll be incredibly helpful for future explorations."
The topic changed mid-conversation, but the atmosphere wasn't bad.
After that, we had a relaxed conversation about this island, whether the village chief Bryungrid really was an ancient hero, and other lighthearted topics.
Such comfortable conversation, it felt like we had gone back to that time.
But...
"Jandel, are you still busy? We should all get together and share the information we collected today."
Until Amelia knocked on the door and Misha left, saying she'd go check.
"Someone told me you were a traitor, what's that all about?"
I couldn't bring myself to ask that question again today.
***
One day, two days, three days...
Time flew by, even in this village.
Our daily routine was simple. I would converse with the village chief or gather information by reading the books he wrote. Amelia, along with Erwen, would explore the village, searching for hidden facilities or locations. Versil, accompanied by Auyen and Misha, would investigate their lifestyle, culture, organizational hierarchy, and military strength.
And Ainar...
"I'm off!"
She acted like a grade-schooler just getting out of school, eager to go play.
"Where are you going today?"
"This morning, mock battle with Itaphia. Then I'm going to the smithy to see them make weapons. After that, I'm meeting with Kagu Didi to explore the underground warehouse. She said I'll be surprised at what's in there, I can't wait!"
How did she manage to make so many friends in such a short time?
I don't understand.
"Fnellin… is amazing. Despite her different appearance and language, she's managed to become so close with you."
"Oh, stop it, it's flattering. And what's so important about language? For us warriors, body language is enough to communicate!"
"Is, is that right? I can't fathom how she manages to make such detailed plans with a language barrier..."
"It's because your heart isn't in it! Magician, stop reading books all day long! Focus on your words, look into the other person's eyes. Then you'll hear their true intentions!"
"Ah, yes..."
A bizarre scene: A Barbarian lecturing a magician.
Making friends with a language barrier is a feat only Ainar can achieve, so I let her go without assigning her any other tasks.
"Whoops! I'm late! I'm off!"
"Okay, don't cause any trouble. After you get back, make sure you tell me what was in the underground warehouse!"
"Got it!"
Every morning, Ainar would leave first, followed by the other teammates who would go about their tasks. In the evening, we would gather at the village chief's house, provided for us, to share our experiences from the day.
"I found a peculiar location today. About 15 minutes from the village chief's house, a building that looked like a normal residence. But there were guards everywhere. It seemed like it might be possible to infiltrate undetected, but I wanted to hear your thoughts first, Jandel."
"Don't force yourself. We need to be careful until at least the rainy season ends."
"I'm with the Silver Lion Clan. The situation is much more unstable than I initially thought. The escaped group and the abandoned group are becoming increasingly hostile towards each other."
"Even after the rainy season, it will be difficult to fully continue our exploration. Auyen, anything to add?"
"Uh, that's… I've felt this from the start, but… Bryungrid… I mean, he calls himself the village chief, but he's basically the king here. In this village."
"He's almost worshipped like a god, rather than a king. When the village chief gives an order, everyone follows without questioning."
"That's it for today."
After the meeting, we would return to our rooms and sleep. That was our routine these days.
Of course, even a set routine would have slight variations.
Rainy Season Day 4. 
The village chief had finished all the books he had been using for his hobby, and I finally left my room and started exploring the village. I couldn't let the only resource that could communicate with the villagers in the ancient language sit idle.
As I was strolling through the village, I ran into the little monster, Marupichichi, after a long time. Most of the villagers were clearly avoiding contact with me, but thankfully, this little guy's attitude towards me remained the same.
We chatted, and he told me a legendary tale that circulates in the village.
"Did you know? A long, long time ago, a giant dragon lived on this island!"
A giant dragon...
Day 5.
I followed Ainar and met her friends, but unfortunately, I couldn't become as close to them as I was with Ainar. They all seemed uncomfortable around me.
Ainar and I were so close that we could even joke with each other by hitting each other playfully.
Did the village chief tell them to be careful?
I persisted with my questions, but I never received a clear answer.
Day 6.
The Silver Lion Clan's captain approached me this morning, asking if I would allow them to join our expedition. I refused outright.
The other group of the clan, split into two, came with the same proposition in the afternoon.
I refused them as well.
Day 7. 
I completed the village investigation and retreated to my room to prepare for the expedition. The ‘rainy season’ ends today.
As I was preparing for tomorrow, the village chief summoned us. He didn't say much, just that he was cheering for us.
Day 8.
No, it wasn't the Rainy Season Day, but the 21st day since our expedition started.
We left the village, which had become rather mundane, and went back onto the island.
The island was beautiful, despite being littered with grotesque corpses. It was particularly beautiful because of the abundance of magic stones everywhere you looked. If it wasn't for the 30-minute disappearance trait, the island would have been teeming with essence cores as well.
The village chief said that the magic stones on the ground would be taken care of by the patrol team, so we should leave them as they were, but would a sparrow pass up a chance at rice?
I took as many as I could without raising any suspicion.
Day 22. 
The island was still teeming with monsters, so I continued to explore the surroundings with the village as our base.
I came across an essence core.
I didn't fight for it. I actually just picked it up. It looked like it had come out from a fight between monsters…
Regardless of who it belonged to, it must have been a decent rank considering it was still alive after the rainy season ended.
I immediately put it in a vial.
We crossed paths with the Silver Lion Clan, who had ventured out from the village for the first time.
They didn't look happy.
Day 23.
I spent the night in the village and went back to the island as soon as morning arrived. The Silver Lion Clan stayed in the village this time too.
Did someone die yesterday?
It seems like they planned to stay in the village until the island was somewhat cleared.
We, on the other hand, gradually expanded our range of activities.
Day 24.
The village started sending patrols to collect the abundant magic stones scattered across the island.
For some reason, my stomach was churning.
Just how much were they worth?
Day 25.
The island had returned to its pre-rainy season state, or rather, the state it was in when we first arrived.
We had searched the island diligently since the rainy season ended, but unfortunately, we couldn't find Hipramajeont.
Did it die in a fight with other monsters?
I asked the village chief, but apparently, there are quite a lot of monsters that leave the island on the waves.
Day 26.
There was nothing left to do on the island, so we left and started sailing.
Day 27.
We discovered another island before sunset.
Or should I even call it an island?
A vast expanse of shimmering silver waves. A giant tree standing tall above it all.
It was much larger than Monster Island, just in terms of area.
Not to mention the height.
I don't know if all the islands here are like this.
Day 28.
We spent the night on the ship and landed on Tree Island.
As soon as we landed the ship at the base of the tree, monsters emerged from the bark. 
A new monster we didn't see in the village chief's book.
After a naming vote, the creature was christened Nanari.
Day 29.
While exploring the roots all day, we came across a knothole bigger than some caves. 
It went deep down, seeming to lead somewhere.
Could this be the way?
I couldn't tell, but as I carefully explored, new monsters continued to appear.
The battle difficulty was fairly high. 
We healed quickly with potions, but Ainar got injured quite badly.
Day 30.
While continuing our careful exploration, I started to genuinely worry about when the labyrinth would close.
The underground level 1, the Record Repository.
When would this place close?
Do I have to live here forever, like the village chief?
It would be a disaster if that were the case. We can't survive like them, eating magic essence. 
We need real food to chew on...
Should I start saving food?
Day 35.
After a grueling six days of climbing through winding tunnels, we found an exit that connected to the outside world. The exit didn't differ much from the root base.
Maybe it was like a calf muscle on a human? 
I don't know how long it will take to reach the top.
Anyway, even though we called it an exit, it was practically just a window to the outside world. So we turned back into the tunnel and began searching for another exit.
Unfortunately, we couldn't find another exit that day. Everyone looked exhausted, so we set up camp for the night and went to sleep early. 
And…
"..."
I woke up with a jolt, as if coming out of a deep sleep.
"My character's soul resonates, drawing me to a specific world."
Somehow, I was back in my room.
"Wait, why am I suddenly here?"
I was genuinely bewildered.
