## The Sixth Mystery (6)
Pointed ears.
Stumpy legs.
Skin covered in animal fur and scales...
The beings surrounding us resembled the heteromorphic races of Laphdonia.
But...
"What are these, exactly?"
"I don't know. Perhaps... beasts?"
They were undeniably different from heteromorphic races. It was like encountering a disconcerting uncanny valley, weren't they?  While bearing resemblance to these races, there was an uncomfortable, alien difference.
"They are… the most gruesome beasts I've ever laid eyes upon."
One creature with pointed ears sported horns on its forehead. Another had stumpy legs, but its torso was of normal proportions. Some exhibited a mix of dragonkin features, sporting animal ears and scales across their bodies. Others had an extra pair of limbs, while some possessed a normal frame with an abnormally large head.  All of them were grotesquely asymmetrical, instantly revealing their abnormality.
"I imagine if God created life from clay and tossed them with the beasts in a container, they would look something like this."
The muttered words perfectly captured their essence, didn't they? 
It was as if their bodies were assembled by rolling random dice at birth.
There were a few more distinct characteristics.
[Kyaa-aa-aa-ak!]
While exhibiting intelligence enough to lure enemies, they seemed to lack a linguistic system.  Furthermore...
"Engage!"
"Everyone, hold your positions!  We need to gather information about the enemy first... Wait, what?"
Despite their earlier vigilance, they were incredibly weak.
"Pwuuk-!" "Khwajik-!"
These creatures, which had managed to surround us undetected by Amelia and the entire reconnaissance squad, were easily dispatched with a single swing of our hammer, crumpling like withered leaves.
'…What's going on?'
They were supposed to be formidable opponents.  
"These guys are much weaker than we thought!"
"Kill… them!"
The squad members, realizing the enemy's lack of prowess, began engaging in a more aggressive assault.  I attempted to moderate their enthusiasm, urging them not to let down their guard.
"Khwajik-!" "Seokeok!" "Khw-aa-aa-aa-ang-!"
However, no unexpected events occurred until every last one of them was dealt with.
'Are they really this weak…?'
Their physical abilities surpassed those of ordinary humans, but that was all. They didn't command spirits like the elves, utilize numbered items like the dwarves, or wield the powers of bound souls.  They didn't even manipulate the essence of mana.
However, there was one peculiar aspect.
"Raven, did you cast a distortion spell?"
"No, I didn't."
"And yet, their corpses remain."
Dozens of the creatures lay scattered across the clearing, their heads, arms, and legs mangled.
"…Are they still alive?"
"They… aren't breathing.  Their heartbeats have stopped."
We cautiously approached and inspected the bodies, but they were simply corpses, untouched by any magical disappearance, let alone alive.
"Investigate."
I placed the remaining troops on high alert and ordered the mages to examine the corpses.  We would need to cast a preservation spell on them and return to base for a proper study, but...
'Well, no wonder we didn't see any barbarians among them.'
Even a cursory examination revealed one crucial detail.
Aside from their appearance, mangled beyond recognition as if crushed by an eighteen-wheeler, they shared one commonality.
"The heart."
The heart.
"It's very similar to a barbarian's heart."
They possessed the hearts of warriors.
***
My mind races.
I learned a secret from my conversation with the vampire.
[Duke… what race do you think I am?]
[…Human, of course.]
'Heteromorphic races' didn't exist during the Duke's time.
Yet, Laphdonia's history records the presence of 'heteromorphic races' on this land even before the Witch's curse engulfed the world.
How is this possible?
The most plausible explanation I came up with at the time was this:
'Similar, but different worlds.'
Just like the parallel world theory on Earth, perhaps that was the case. A world where one could cross through dimensional portals and embark on mysterious adventures in a labyrinth.  It wasn't entirely inconceivable.
However, things have changed somewhat.
[Alchemy, you see. It was initially a pursuit focused on creating 'humans'.]
Alchemy.
[Oh, didn't you know? Ancient records fetch a hefty price when sold to the royal family.]
Despite actively collecting these records, the ancient history was curiously missing many parts.
[Humans can handle any power. Aura, divine power, magic, even spirit magic.]
The inherent potential of humans, capable of wielding every power.
And...
[It was different from magic or mana. It felt like power residing in a voice, imprinted upon my blood and soul from birth.  It proclaimed him as my king, my master.]
The veiled King's unique power.
[Ah, speaking of which, the old man in the magical tower didn't realize his true identity until we knelt before him, and he followed suit.]
A multitude of information gathered throughout my journey coalesced, pointing towards one possibility.
Perhaps.
Just maybe.
The five heteromorphic races, excluding humans, were manufactured.
For someone's purpose.
Or rather...
'It's the royal family. It can't be anyone else.'
While I feel like a conspiracy theorist, it makes sense when you think about it in reverse.
Think of the heteromorphic races as human slaves.
They utilize their superior physical abilities to delve into the labyrinth and mine stones.
They're slaves who even pay higher taxes.
'They're even taxed at a higher rate.'
Of course, there is historical context behind the increased taxes levied on heteromorphic races.
However, I now question even that history.
I'm not doubting the existence of the history, but rather...
'Could there have been a mastermind behind this history?'
Covertly pushing the heteromorphic races, manipulating events from behind the scenes.
It wouldn't have been a difficult task for the royal family with their vast network of agents.
"…What are you thinking about all of a sudden?"
"I was pondering what kind of dried meat I'll be eating later."
I gave Raven a vague answer.
While I'm certain of this possibility, it's just a single theory.
And if this is true, I can't say more. 
It's a secret too heavy to disclose lightly.
"Ahem, anyway, make sure to cast preservation magic on all the remaining bodies and store them properly. We'll need to conduct a thorough study once we return."
"Are you planning to head back right away?"
"Absolutely not. The exploration continues.  We haven't figured out anything about this place yet."
After the battle concluded and the investigation was wrapped up, I led my squad to continue exploring the surrounding area.
One day, two days, three days.
Our extensive search for mapmaking purposes brought us face-to-face with numerous beasts.
Countless mechanical beasts, akin to those we encountered in the Pantelion ruins, as well as mechanical giants, were encountered several times.
Among them were 'Doppels'.
Incidentally, 'Doppel' is the name Raven assigned to the beasts resembling heteromorphic races.
The etymology is ancient, and the meaning is simple.
'Other being.'
It's a name overflowing with Raven's typical pretentious naming sense, but considering its meaning, it's quite fitting.
"Yandel."
Oh, goodness, you startled me.
"Make some noise if you're coming. Are you back from your search?"
Amelia nodded in response to my question and went straight to the point.
"During our search, we discovered a peculiar artificial structure leading somewhere. I think it would be best to investigate it together at dawn."
"An artificial structure?"
I asked Amelia for more details, and after hearing everything, I had a hunch that we finally achieved some progress.
However, everyone was exhausted, so we decided to rest well and investigate it in the morning as Amelia suggested.
"Here it is."
The next day, I followed Amelia to a plain jungle.  No matter how I looked around, it was indistinguishable from the countless other regions we had explored.
However…
"…We need to pay more attention to the ground from now on."
"It's only thanks to luck that we found this."
As we cleared the knee-high vegetation, something hidden beneath was revealed.
A hatch, resembling a manhole cover installed on the bare ground.  A handle was thoughtfully attached for convenience.
"I didn't touch or even try to open it because there could have been a trap."
"You made the right decision."
We requested an investigation from the mages, and they reported that there didn't seem to be any significant danger.
So, is it just a matter of opening it then?
"Deuruk, deuruk, kkiigik, thuk-!"
As I turned the handle, a click signaled the release of the locking mechanism, and the hatch swung open.
As expected, it was a cylindrical structure, with a ladder attached to one side for descending.
'The depth is…'
The depth measured approximately twenty meters using the Light Orb spell.
However, we couldn't ascertain what lay beneath from this angle.
"Then I'll…"
"Don't be ridiculous. I'll go down."
Before I could speak, Amelia cut me off and stepped forward.
She seemed determined to go, no matter what I said.
We stood there, locked in a silent standoff, our gazes meeting.
"What are you mulling over?"
Raven chuckled and interjected herself between us.
"I'll check it out."
"What?"
"Oh, I mean, I'll use magic."
"Ah…"
As Amelia and I backed down in embarrassment, Raven levitated a recording crystal and sent it down.  Much safer than having a person go down, for sure.
However, these tools had limitations.
"There's another straight passage after you go down, and it's blocked by an iron door."
The iron door blocked the way from the very bottom, making it impossible to learn anything further with this method.  Therefore...
"…Don't even think about going first. I'm the leader of this reconnaissance squad."
Ultimately, it was decided that Amelia would go down first.
'Well, she was mad about my silly name earlier.'
Amelia descended first, followed by one of the mages.
And once a certain level of safety was secured, I entered the passage.
"…"
Even with [Gigantification] deactivated, the narrow space made the descent on the ladder quite inconvenient.  It was so tight that even with my shoulders hunched, I barely fit.
'Barbarians get the short end of the stick.'
I guess this kind of discriminatory architecture has always existed.
"This way, Yandel."
After finally reaching the bottom, Amelia called out to me from within the passage.
"Unlike above, there's no lock visible. And I don't know what it's made of, but even using aura didn't leave a scratch on it."
Hmm, if it's immune to aura, it's practically immune to physical damage.
"What about magic?"
I asked, and the mage who had entered second cautiously replied.
This fellow... was he the captain's right-hand man?
"Apart from dimensional severance, a special magical flow structure is observed. However, the density is quite low, so it's unlikely to be an offensive trap. With such a weak flow, it's likely just for opening and closing the door."
"And?"
"Curiously, the dimensional severance is not above the door, but beyond it."
"Hmm, so it doesn't mean aura can't penetrate because of the severance?"
"Based on my observations, that's the case."
"Metal immune to aura…"
"Thuk-thuk."
I knocked gently on the door, trying to sound like a knock.
I don't know what might be hidden inside, but the iron door alone felt valuable.
"Captain of the Investigation Squad."
"…Are you addressing me?"
"Yes. Do you think you can detach this whole thing?  If we melt it down and make armor out of it, it would be fantastic."
"Well… I think it's worth a try.  Aside from making it into armor, it's definitely a rare mineral."
Okay, so that's settled.
I don't know why he's hesitant about making it into armor, but he seems to agree with detaching it.
"What?"
Suddenly, a faint vibration echoed from the door.
"Yandel, step back!"
Amelia's shout startled me, and I unconsciously stepped back. 
However, the following events were surprisingly uneventful.
"Deuruk, deuruk."
A turning sound came from inside the door, followed by a click, and the round door opened smoothly.
[The 1st record access qualifications are confirmed.]
[Entry is permitted.]
What the heck is this?
"Do you know why it opened suddenly?"
"No idea.  When we made contact earlier, there was no response."
"I see…"
I'm a bit stunned, but there are two possibilities: someone opened the door after hearing my knock.
Or...
'Perhaps a specific, unknown condition was met.'
Personally, I suspect the latter, but it doesn't really matter now.
As the mage relayed the situation to the top using a message stone, I slowly entered the passage beyond the iron door.
'Hmm?'
A problem arose here.
Turning my head, I saw Amelia stuck to the door.
Her palm was pressed against the air, making her look as if she were performing a mime act. Her lips were moving, but no sound reached me.
"What's going on?  Can't you enter?"
"How the hell did you get in?"
Sensing something amiss, I quickly stepped back out and questioned her.  After a few experiments, I confirmed one fact.
"The door is open, but the dimensional severance remains in effect. It's utterly incomprehensible…"
The reason is unknown, but only I can pass through this door.
Therefore...
"Wait here.  I'll be back in a jiffy."
"What? Wait—."
Before Amelia could start nagging, I quickly entered the passage again.
"Hwaruruk-!"
The interior was dark, but activating my barbarian candle mode helped a bit.
'Feels like I'm inside a submarine…'
Everything in sight was covered in sheet metal, and pipes and wires of unknown purpose were scattered everywhere.
"Deolkeok, deolkeok."
There were no forks in the passage, so I just kept going straight, and after walking about a hundred meters, another opening appeared, allowing me to descend on a ladder.
However, instead of going down right away, I decided to open the iron door next to it and check it out.
"Deolkeok."
Thankfully, it opened easily without a hitch.
I quickly glanced inside, closed my eyes briefly, and opened them again.
"Huu…"
A passage extending endlessly, out of sight.
A line of test tubes filled with green liquid.
Honestly, it didn't feel real.  I don't know why the genre suddenly switched to sci-fi, but...
'Doppel.'
The beasts that resembled heteromorphic races, the ones Raven named as such, were huddled in the test tubes, staring at me.
