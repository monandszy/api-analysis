## Destination (6)
“If it’s Iblus…”
“Don’t worry. I’ve already confirmed that [The Heretical Altar] is set up within the royal palace.”
It was merely a guess, but I said it anyway. 
Well, it was almost a certainty, so it wasn’t a lie either.
“…Impressive.”
“I thought you’d say that. Iblus’s essence isn’t common—.”
“Not that, but that you’d make such a suggestion.”
The village chief remained silent for a long time after hearing my proposal, and the stillness stretched on. 
“….”
“….”
The quiet wasn’t unwelcome to me. 
I’d been thrown into this situation as soon as I woke up. I needed time to gather my thoughts anyway.
‘Jerome Saintred….’
What would happen if I handed this body over to the village chief?
I had made the proposal, but I hadn't thought deeply about the consequences. 
So, let’s quickly summarize: 
‘…It’s not bad, actually?’
The village chief becoming the commander of the First Royal Knights was quite positive. 
After all, wouldn’t the royal family’s strength be diminished?
Also, since we had a secret connection, we could share information or trade favors whenever necessary.
The only issue was the moral part…
‘He was the one who stabbed me in the back first.’
If he hadn’t tried to betray me first, this wouldn’t have happened.  Or perhaps, we could’ve teamed up and defeated the village chief together in another timeline. 
If this village chief really had the confidence, he would’ve simply overpowered me and taken my body.
[I’m certain of it now. You’re the one who operated in Noirarc under the name ‘Iron Mask’ decades ago.]
Jerome already believed I was ‘Iron Mask.’ Therefore, I had to find a way to explain or silence him. 
If the royal family found out about that, it would be a weakness—
“Just one question.”
The village chief finally spoke, slowly.
“What happened to me after I lost to them?”
Yes, I knew he’d ask that.
He probably wasn’t sure if I was telling the truth. He wanted to gather more information before making a final decision.
Therefore, this time I answered honestly.
“You’re executed. By Jerome’s hand. Seven times with his sword, your head sliced clean off.”
“That doesn’t make—.”
“Then, one of my comrades uses the Resurrection Stone on me.”
This was the future I’d seen. 
“You… have the Resurrection Stone?”
“Believe it or not, that’s the truth.”
“….”
The village chief closed his mouth tightly, as if organizing his thoughts. I waited, giving him the time he needed.
“If that’s true… it makes sense.”
“What part?”
“If I truly couldn’t achieve my goal, as you said, why would you make this proposal to me?”
So, that was what he was really curious about.
While secretly thinking he was a cunning one, I hid my emotions and spoke.
“In any case, with the Resurrection Stone, your goal cannot be achieved.”
The Resurrection Stone has two distinctive properties.
One is that the resurrection of the deceased is only possible immediately after death, and only if the body remains…
“It erases memories when used.”
That’s the second property.
In the game, using the Resurrection Stone would cause the character to lose their memories and reset all stats, including their level of intimacy.
Thinking back, it was a terrible device.
I used that precious item to revive them, but both of those bastards eventually left the party. 
“Indeed… that’s a problem.”
Fortunately, the village chief seemed to know about the properties of the ‘Resurrection Stone.’  It would’ve been another whole story explaining it if he hadn’t known. 
“The inscription on the record stone clearly states that you’ll leave this place eventually. But… with that item, it means there’s a possibility that the person in the records isn’t you or me— but someone else.”
Hearing those words, I felt like we were nearly there.
After all, the biggest reason why the village chief was trying to take my body was because of ‘certainty.’ 
My body will eventually leave this floor.
That’s why he could escape 100% if he just took my body.
The Resurrection Stone negated that proposition…
“So, what are you going to do?”
The only thing left was his decision.
Would he take my body, which has the Resurrection Stone as a variable? Or would he escape to the city using Jerome Saintred’s body?
I added an option since waiting for his answer felt a bit too anxious. 
“If you’re going to take that guy’s body, I’ll help you.”
“You… are a different person from what I heard.”
“Well, I don’t know what stories you’ve heard about me, but this is self-defense. Didn’t he try to betray me first?”
“That’s true.”
“So, what’s your answer?”
I swallowed my saliva and asked. The village chief finally answered:
“I refuse.”
…Damn it. 
***
“Refusal…?”
I couldn’t understand it.
I explained to him the logical reason why he should choose Jerome instead of me, yet he refused?  This emotionless bastard couldn’t have made an emotional choice…
“…Why?”
“It’s because of your existence.”
“…What?”
It was a confusing answer, but the explanation that followed made me understand his decision. 
“Even if I take his body, you know my true identity. If you go out and tell anyone, the life I barely got will become difficult.”
He wanted to eliminate witnesses. 
“So?”
“So, I think it’s better to kill you here and take his body.”
“Are you stupid? I helped you betray the First Royal Knights. Why would I spread rumors?”
“You never know with people. Ironically, trust is not built on faith.”
It was ironic, but in that one sentence, I sensed a chance for negotiation.
Trust is not built on faith.
That means, if I offer him something believable, he might accept my proposition. 
“So… what do you want?”
My question was met with a direct answer from the village chief, without any hesitation.
“Your weakness.”
“….”
“Just like you could ruin me with one word, if I had something like that on you, I could trust you and work together.”
He’s trying to squeeze everything out of me. 
“What if there’s nothing like that?”
“Someone who has nothing to hide doesn’t ask such a question.”
While his way of thinking was confirmation bias, he was right this time.
The moment he mentioned ‘weakness,’ a few things immediately came to mind.
The evil spirit.
The incident where I killed the Rose Knights at Icerock.
And even the fact that I’d interfered with Jerome in Noirarc decades ago and stole the fragments of the record stone.
There were a few things I could give up if I wanted to talk.
Besides, if I could avoid the future the Goddess showed me by giving them up, then giving them up wouldn’t be a loss. 
But…
‘Does he think I’m an idiot?’
I answered firmly.
“I refuse.”
It wasn’t an excuse saying I had no weakness, but a clear refusal.
“Refusal…?”
He asked with the same confusion I had before, but my answer wouldn’t change.
The fact that he even made such a proposition was proof.
He found my offer extremely attractive.
So…
“Like I said, there are only two options. You accept my offer, or you refuse and figure it out on your own. That’s it.”
I said finally.
“There are no conditions.”
“…You’re very bold in a life-or-death situation.”
“That’s how Barbarian warriors are.”
The village chief chuckled a little, taken aback by my nonchalant answer, and replied without hesitation.
“Alright, let’s put our heads together then. How do we take Jerome Saintred’s body.”
Whew, I almost got played. 
***
After the successful negotiation with the village chief.
We had a long conversation inside the cave. 
How to lure Jerome Saintred to this cave and take his body.
Coming up with this plan didn’t take long.
It wasn’t a difficult plan if the village chief and I cooperated.
However, the conversation dragged on about something else.
“So, what is ‘it’ that you promised Jerome? Tell me. We’re practically on the same side now.”
It was something I’d been curious about.
What kind of proposal did he make to convince Jerome to betray me?
Surprisingly, the village chief answered coolly.
“It’s the Heart of Karui.”
“Karui…?”
The name of the ancient evil god came out of nowhere.
When I tilted my head in confusion, the village chief explained kindly, pointing to a black rock in the center of the cave.
“This is what I’m talking about. By sacrificing a human life, you can use one of the powers of Karui from the myths. The reason I can possess other people’s bodies is all thanks to this.”
It was an item that didn’t appear in the game.
Well, it wasn’t surprising. 
“So why did Jerome want it?”
“Well, it’s one of the royal treasures. It originally belonged to the Immortal King. The reason I’m in this state is because I stole this.”
There was something I needed to listen to more carefully than the village chief’s past crimes.
“It was a royal treasure?  Could it be… the Immortal King lived forever because of this?”
“Oh, didn’t you know? The Immortal King would inherit the throne by possessing his child’s body after the child was born. That’s why the Immortal King always wore a mask.”
This was a secret story hidden within the great kingdom of Raphdonia.
‘I had no idea the Immortal King had such a secret.’
Perhaps the Heavenbreaker King’s defeat of the Immortal King and his usurpation of the throne wasn’t ‘liberation,’ but merely an act to save his own life.
‘Or maybe… the Immortal King just died because this item was lost.’
In any case, the value of this treasure for the Heavenbreaker King who succeeded him would be immeasurable.
It’s no wonder Jerome would be so obsessed after hearing this story. 
His loyalty to the royal family was genuine. 
“Wait, that doesn’t make sense. If you ran off with this item, how could the Immortal King have lived for thousands of years?”
The Immortal King lived a life close to eternal life, as his name suggests, and passed away about 150 years ago.
“Well, I was surprised to hear that too. But it’s the royal family, right? They definitely found some kind of solution.”
“Yes, I see. You don’t know…”
The Immortal King. The Heart of Karui. The Heavenbreaker King…
What kind of events happened during that time?
I was curious, but there was nothing more I could learn here.
“Is that all you’re curious about?”
“No, just one more thing. By the way, what happened to the leader of the Silver Lion Clan that you sent to the library?”
“Oh, that? I sent one of the village warriors to watch your movements. If you make a deal to possess someone’s body for a month, the amount of offerings needed for the ritual is greatly reduced… No, I don’t know why I’m explaining this.”
Ah, you figured it out.
I was just wondering why he was answering so well.
“Let’s end this conversation. Let’s go up.”
The village chief abruptly ended the conversation and led the way.
“He’ll be waiting for us.”
Jerome Saintred.
It was time to make him pay for betraying me.
