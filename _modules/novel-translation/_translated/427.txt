##  Chapter 427: Ice Cold (2)
Elibaba (Black)  Max Damage Mode.
The Blackened Mode, or simply Black Mode, is the most extreme out of the many modes that can be activated through [Spirit Transformation].
All resistances are reduced to zero.
Furthermore, it takes damage from divine power, making it impossible to receive healing.
But in return, 
It gains immunity to all status effects, including bleeding, poisoning, stun, paralysis, and bind.
An absurd effect.
However, random penalties are still applied as system effects, not status effects, so they remain, but...
That's not the most important part at the moment.
The core of this Black Mode lies elsewhere.
“All attacks receive an unavoidable strike bonus.”
An unavoidable blow.
A unique option exclusive to the Black Mode throughout [Dungeon & Stone].
Of course, in line with this game's love for equivalence exchanges, there's a greater price to pay, beyond the glass cannon nature of the mode.
“All resource consumption increases by 20 times.”
“The cooldown of all skills increases by 5 times.”
These two lines of text can instantly turn any healthy explorer into a cripple.
But currently, these don't apply to me.
I'm already half-crippled due to the random penalties.
The only thing I need to worry about is this.
“The longer the mode is active, the greater the backlash the character will experience.”
I need to minimize the backlash.
In simpler terms, time is more valuable than gold at this moment.
‘Alright, let's go for it.’
As I stepped forward, Six swiftly widened the distance between us, like a fly.
Thud.
She seems to be wary of my altered form.
Does she intend to scout first?
If so, I'm grateful.
Whoooosh-!
I swing my hammer, closing the increased distance.
After all, there's no attack判定 if I swing it at nothing.
Even if it ultimately results in merely cleaving the air, I confirmed through experimentation that the unavoidable blow bonus applies only if there's a clear target.
Thud.
As it has been throughout this battle, the woman dodges the hammer with the minimum movement possible.
“Receives unavoidable strike bonus.”
The bonus effect activates.
Screeeee-!
Space tears open diagonally, following the trajectory of the hammer.
"······!"
The woman's eyes widen.
Even if she doesn't know what this phenomenon is, she’s raised her concentration to the limit to prepare for any eventuality.
———!
The swinging hammer disappears into the darkness of the split space, and the sound of the weapon's impact ceases.
Roll, roll.
The woman's pupils widen, her gaze searching for the vanished weapon's trace.
Well, it's useless anyway.
“…!!”
In the blink of an eye, a hammer that seems to transcend space strikes Six's body.
The physical force with which it was first swung is preserved entirely.
Bang—!
The blunt sound that follows shortly.
Unfortunately, the sensation isn't satisfying.
It hit her abdomen, and...
‘Why is this woman so durable?’
At first, I assumed she was simply a Dexterity type, but it seems she invested heavily in Defense stats as well.
Well, she does seem to be affected, judging from her expression when she gets hit.
‘Darn. If I could only use [Swing], I could have torn her apart.’
The damage increase effect of the Devil Crusher only activates when using blunt weapon skills, which I find regrettable.
But...
‘If it doesn't work in one go, I'll do it again.’
I'll have time to regret it later, after everything fails.
Whoooosh-!
I swing the hammer again, dismissing my regrets.
Thud.
Six is even further away than before.
She must be wary after the blow she took before, but…
It doesn't work that way.
Bang-!
The unavoidable blow strikes again, surpassing distance.
‘Finally hit her head.’
This time, the impact felt much more satisfying.
But, surprisingly, Six didn't even make a small groan.
The only movement she made was a slight stagger.
Swoosh.
Six slowly lifted her head, which had been lowered, and glared at me.
And then...
“Spit.”
She mechanically spit out the blood she'd been holding in her mouth and opened her mouth with a nonchalant voice.
“Remembered.”
…What?
“5th Rank monster, Flora's ability, [Spirit Transformation]. The effect when an  [Dark Spirit] is added.”
Oh.
‘Does she know the effects of the Essences by heart?’
Maybe she does.
She's a specially trained agent from the Kingdom, after all.
"It’s my first time actually seeing it, so I was a little slow in identifying it…"
When her words trailed off,
I immediately kicked off the ground and dashed forward.
"It’ll be different from now on."
Unlike before, Six didn’t retreat.
Instead...
Thud-!
She charged towards me.
Her action made me instantly realize.
That her words weren’t empty promises.
And...
‘Darn, I’ve only hit her twice.’
I realized this is where hell begins.
***
Whoooosh-!
I swing the hammer, following Six's trajectory as she charges.
She doesn't dodge.
She’s made a cold judgment based on the information she has.
‘If she doesn’t dodge, she can choose the area of impact.’
The hammer makes contact first.
Bang-!
But at the same time the hammer hits Six's shoulder,
Puf-!
A dagger coated in Aura pierces my bicep like tofu.
‘Darn, this is why I've been saving the Dark Barbarian Mode…’
Even though it's a tit-for-tat exchange, it's clear who's getting the short end of the stick.
As her arrogant eyes indicate.
"You’re more agile than I thought. I was aiming for your neck."
Damn it.
If she’d just cursed me, I would have been flattered, but…
More agile?
This is the ultimate insult.
Ache.
Thanks to my zero Pain Resistance, I feel a burning pain in my pierced bicep.
I decide to be positive.
Well, I’m taking Aura damage with zero resistance, so this is pretty good. If the piercing spot had been my shoulder, or even worse, the skin, the injury would have been much worse.
Yeah, so…
"Behe—laaaaaaaa—!!!”
I unleash a war cry, fueled by the sharp pain.
"Tough one."
This match will be over sooner than I thought.
‘One more.’
I swing the hammer again.
It’s the same setup as before.
Six doesn't dodge this time either, and throws her dagger.
And...
Bang-!
Slice.
We exchange blows again.
“······.”
This time, Six’s target is her shoulder, the same spot she was hit before.
‘Damn it.’
As for me, it’s the hand holding my shield.
I tried to use my shield to buy myself a turn, but the Aura-laden dagger pierced through the shield, then through my palm.
Clang.
The strap holding the shield to my wrist was also cut, and the shield falls to the ground helplessly.
Darn, my pinky and ring finger are caught in the shield.
But...
‘One more.’
I swing the hammer again, regardless.
However, the setup is slightly different this time.
Six, who had been charging forward without dodging, held the two daggers she had been holding in her hands together, blocking the trajectory of the hammer.
However...
Screeee-!
Just before the hammer collides with the daggers, it receives the bonus effect and disappears into the darkness.
And soon.
Bang-!
It strikes Six's ankle, defying space.
With less fat, the impact must have been significant, but Six still had a calm expression.
"······So, it doesn’t work that way, does it?”
Ha, it feels like I’m being attacked like a monster that’s being targeted.
‘One more.’
I swing the hammer.
Bang-!
One hit.
Puf.
Another cut appears on my body.
One, two, three, four...
After a few more blows,
I finally acknowledge Six.
‘This woman… is much stronger than I thought.’
Her innate skills are beyond question.
She can use Aura, and her swordsmanship is as sharp as Orculis's captain.
Bang-.
Furthermore, this woman isn't ignorant.
After only a few exchanges, she’s started to use her knowledge about the Blackened Mode.
Puf-.
Her judgment is the same.
“I can't use this shoulder anymore."
Six throws the dagger she’d been holding in her left hand to the ground, as if she’d made a decisive judgment that she’s no longer able to use it.
After the Elition started, she’s been blocking most of my attacks with her left bicep and shoulder.
A cool mind, focused on concentrating damage in one area.
‘I’ve hit her over ten times, and only broken one arm…’
Of course, compared to my state, with my entire body cut and punctured, she’s a saint, but…
Still, I don't regret using the Blackened Mode.
Because...
‘If I’d left her be, it would have been a disaster.’
You think I can just hold her off?
While I'm losing stamina, she’s staying in peak condition?
It’s a disaster waiting to happen.
So far, it's been beneficial for her to hold me off, but if she ever has a reason to break free, her blade will be aimed at my comrades.
Clank.
Thus, I shift my mindset.
My original goal was to take damage and eliminate her as quickly as possible to support my comrades, but…
‘At least… I have to deal with her here.’
Alright, simplifying the goal makes it clearer.
I'll worry about the rest later.
As a Barbarian warrior.
Bang-!
I focus more on this moment.
So that when that woman makes even the slightest mistake,
I can pounce on her like a wild dog.
Puf.
The daggers, which had been avoiding vital areas like my biceps, skin, wrists, and thighs, pierce deep into my lower abdomen.
"······!"
Damn, this is dangerous.
Sreee.
I force myself to stabilize my body with my lower body strength and quickly sort out my thoughts.
‘How much longer can I hold on?’
Or rather, how many seconds are left?
I don’t know for sure, but it doesn’t seem like I have much time left.
But...
‘Not yet.’
I suppress the urge to rush.
Because this is coming.
The moment I can play my trump card.
Bang-!
Puf-.
The fierce exchange continues.
Or rather, it's ridiculous to even call it an exchange.
We’re just attacking and attacking again, disregarding defense, to kill each other.
"The paladin who died before."
The woman who’d been tearing through my body without a word suddenly spoke.
And then, she asks.
"Was he someone close to you?"
I don’t know why she’s curious.
But...
Whoooosh-!
I swing my weapon once more and reply.
"No."
We didn't know each other long enough to call him close.
But one thing is for sure.
"Then I don't understand. Why go to such lengths?"
"He wasn’t someone who deserved to die here."
I don’t know much about him.
I’ve only seen one side of the many facets he revealed in the labyrinth.
It’s all the more regrettable.
What was it like for him to explore with Jun?
It must have been nice.
They must have gotten along well, but occasionally, he would have shown a weary expression when Jun’s habits from his Inquisitor days showed.
Whoooosh-!
Jun’s unwavering support must have been a burden, but also a source of comfort at times.
Whoooosh-!
What about at parties?
Did he drink well? This kind of person always changes when they drink.
What kind of drinker was he?
Whoooosh-!
I don’t know.
They took that chance away from him.
Or rather, they took it from all the members, not just Jun.
Puf-!
These weren’t lives destined to fade into oblivion.
So…
“Behe—laaaaaaaa—!!!”
I force my paralyzed arm to move.
I won’t let them take anything more from me.
Clank-!
I forcefully stabilize my body, using the muscles that were cut from my thigh.
Swoosh.
As if determined to crush me, a sharp Aura defies air resistance and flies towards my abdomen.
But at the same time.
“The luck that resides in the character blocks the damage.”
Finally, the moment I’ve been waiting for has come.
Thud.
The dagger stops in mid-air as if hitting an invisible barrier.
‘Alright, finally triggered, huh.’
It’s the Essence [Probabilistic Retribution] from my Gachapon.
The passive effect works, whether the active skill is sealed or not.
“Reflects 15% of the damage taken to the enemy.”
A Skeleton spawns on my left side and swings a dagger at Six.
It’s not an ordinary dagger.
It’s a dagger that blazes with Aura, the same color as Six's.
Thud.
Six hastily gathers herself and steps back.
This is a scene I’ve witnessed several times before.
Even before I activated the Blackened Mode, [Probabilistic Retribution] kept triggering, and Six, that woman, was unbelievably agile at dodging counterattacks.
But…
Grin.
This is a good sign, after a long time.
‘I guess she doesn’t know that much about the Blackened Mode, huh?’
If she did, she wouldn’t have made that instantaneous judgment.
The Blackened Mode’s unavoidable blow bonus applies to passive skills, too, like this.
Just like this.
Screeee-!
As soon as the Skeleton’s dagger cleaves the air,
A rift appears in space and swallows the dagger.
And soon.
Puf-!
It transcends space and pierces Six’s body.
“Krrk.”
For the first time in what feels like forever, a groan escapes that steel woman.
But…
‘Damn it.’
It's not satisfying.
‘It pierced her thigh?’
If it had hit her neck, heart, or forehead, it would have been game over.
It’s regrettable, but I’ve abandoned the illusion.
‘I didn’t expect this to happen, either.’
I’ve clashed with countless enemies since I met Hans A in the Crystal Cave.
And…
‘Yeah, this is more like my ending.’
What always led me to victory was Plan B.
So, in that sense.
As planned.
Thud.
It’s time to play my trump card.
Puf-puf-puf-!
I dash forward and spit the blood I’d been holding in my mouth at Six’s face.
I don’t have the Corpse Golem’s [Acidic Fluid] anymore.
But at least I can obscure her vision.
Whoooosh-!
Spitting blood and swinging the hammer was almost simultaneous.
It’s an attack that expertly pierces her line of sight.
But Six, as if seeing the trajectory, sticks out her shoulder.
It’s that same shoulder that’s dangling from its socket.
She really gets her money’s worth from that one arm.
Bang-!
The hammer hits her shoulder.
Swoosh-!
Even so, she still swings her dagger forward.
I don't dodge.
Puf-!
The dagger pierces deep into my lower abdomen.
Swoosh.
Ignoring the pain, I reach my arm forward, as if I’d been waiting for this moment.
It’s the arm that usually holds my shield, which is now hanging limply, unused since I got my hand sliced earlier.
Six’s eyes harden.
"······!"
Oh, so you didn’t expect this.
It was worth holding back all this time.
Thud.
As soon as my fingertips touch Six’s neck,
Clank-.
I grasp her neck with my index finger, thumb, and middle finger, then...
Crack-!
I ram my forehead into her forehead, which doesn’t waver even in this situation.
And...
Kwaang-!
Instead of catching her as she falls, I fall on top of her, crushing her.
Puf-!
My side feels like it’s burning.
It’s a bit ridiculous.
She’s stabbing me even while she’s falling?
Whoooosh-!
I bring the hammer down, adjusting my grip from the mount position.
An amazing thing happens.
‘Darn… she’s insane.’
Even though her upper body is restrained, she dodges my hammer by moving only her neck with her reflexes.
It’s amazing, but it’s not a significant move.
The unavoidable blow bonus applies even in close range, after all.
Crack-!
The hammer that was swung towards her head passes through space and crushes Six’s foot.
Puf-!
I get another stab to my side for my troubles.
I suddenly feel dizzy, as if all my strength is draining away.
But I force myself to use that energy to bring the hammer down again.
Kwaak-!
This time, the impact spot is good.
The hammer hit her wrist hard, and the dagger she’d been holding so firmly all this time flies up in the air and falls to the ground.
‘Alright, no more weapons.’
I swing the hammer again, abandoning my concerns about counterattacks.
Kwaak-! Kwaak-! Kwaak-!
Six had managed to protect her head three times by twisting her neck with a mystical movement, but it was different this time.
Because this time, I hit her right in the forehead.
Kwaak-!
A powerful impact travels to her brain, and her body freezes up as if she’s having a seizure.
But I don't stop swinging the hammer.
The unavoidable blow bonus no longer triggers.
Apparently, this monster woman can’t even use her reflexes to dodge by moving only her neck with a proper concussion.
Kwaak, Kwaak, Kwaak-!
I hit her head three more times with the hammer.
‘One more.’
As I’m ready for my fourth blow and pick up the hammer,
I see Six’s eyes through her battered face, with her flesh and bones pulverized.
It was a strange experience.
I’ve cracked the skulls of countless enemies, but I’ve never seen an enemy like this.
“······.”
Her eyes are calm, not like those of someone in trouble.
She looks up at me with those eyes, and says.
“…I lost.”
Huh, she’s so cool.
I didn't think she’d be the type to beg for her life, but I didn’t know she was this level-headed.
Whatever.
“Ni, a… Raf. Donia······.”
I swing the hammer with all my might.
Kwaak-!
The bone-chilling sound of impact stops Six’s body, which had been lying under me.
“Heave, heave, heave….”
My breath is ragged, barely able to sustain itself.
‘Is she really… dead?’
It’s hard to believe.
She was a powerful opponent.
But I can't stay still forever.
Swoosh.
Slowly, I stand up, my breath still ragged.
And...
"Er… Wen, it’s enough now, [Spirit Transformation]—"
Just take it off.
As I’m about to say those words,
[Uncle—!!!!]
My vision turns white, and my body staggers as if I’m experiencing orthostatic hypotension.
‘Damn it….’
I need to stand up right now.
I still have enemies to take down.
Swoosh.
My eyes close.
