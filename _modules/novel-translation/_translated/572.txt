Survival. That was the absolute excuse, the one that justified everything.  The sole proposition that I, in this rotten world, must survive, made all my actions "necessary."
And...
"So it seems."
Crescent Moon was a victim of those "necessary" actions.
"For the body to remain..."
When I first came to this roundtable, I was an insignificant being. Everything I encountered outside could have led to my death, and to gain information, I had to wander the taverns every night.
So, I donned the mask of the Lion.
To obtain the information I needed, I held hostage and toyed with someone's hopes.
In this world, honesty is a sin.
Being underestimated would mean being devoured.
The more I gained, the safer my companions and I would be.
At that time, I truly believed that.
But...
"The tales and reality are different..."
What about now?
While I still worry about 'survival', I am far stronger than I was then. I became the leader of a clan, a noble.
The Yandel family is now a respected noble house belonging to the Melbes, the interracial noble alliance.  Thanks to that, I don't need to rely on the roundtable's information anymore.
Yet, I'm still deceiving everyone, wearing the mask of the Lion.
Why?
The answer came quickly.
The Queen, the Jester.
The Wolf, seemingly connected to Auril Gavisse, the mysterious Black Mask, and the Butterfly.
I want to gain from the information they bring.
Yes, that was my genuine desire.
But...
"Thanks to this, I can finally abandon my pointless dreams."
I soon realized.
'Survival' was no longer an excuse I could use.
Just as black ink cannot exist beside white paper.
"But I can't thank you."
It was simply who I was.
Someone who would deceive and bully others, manipulating them for my own gain.
The kind of person I used to despise.
I, who was constantly rolling and rolling, driven by the sole purpose of surviving in this savage world, had become that person.
"..."
"..."
Heavy silence hangs in the air.
Even the Jester, who would usually mock the person who was tricked, remained silent, observing the situation.
How long had it been?
"I..."
Breaking the long silence, Crescent Moon rose from his seat.
"I'm leaving now. It seems there is nothing left for me here."
True to his words, Crescent Moon left the roundtable without giving anyone a chance to speak.
"He… he really left…?"
An anonymous community where none knew each other's names.
In effect, leaving like this meant an uncertain future of when we might meet again.  Yet, knowing this, I couldn't bring myself to say it.
The words of apology.
"..."
"..."
To speak those words would be a loss.
I thought that to myself.
***
Whether Crescent Moon left the roundtable or not.
The roundtable's final gathering continued.
It might seem cold-hearted, but considering the nature of this place, it was only natural.
We were all business associates in the end.
"Heh, he really left. How boring."
The Jester's nonsense was ignored by everyone, who clenched their teeth as they began the second round.
The first turn was the Stag.
But...
"This is...…"
Instead of offering information, the Stag looked at me and asked.
"Do you really find this fun? You?"
The voice and gaze were clearly aggressive.
We weren't particularly close, but was the Stag a bit shocked by Crescent Moon's departure?
"Mr. Stag… please… calm down…"
The Goblin spoke, as if trying to appease the Stag.
Not only him, but other members looked at him with concerned eyes.
However, the Stag didn't care at all.
"To someone desperate… you give them hope, then snatch it away. Is that just another form of entertainment for you? That's why you spoke up, thinking today was the last day?"
To defend myself, it wasn't entirely true.
The fact that I spoke up today was actually a matter of responsibility... no, it would be more accurate to call it guilt.
My obsession with 'fun' at the roundtable?
It was simply to create the character of the Lion. No, to be more precise, it was to deceive the members using this, and manipulate them to my liking.
"Lion. You must be a big shot compared to someone like me. But I have to say this."
"..."
"You're just a broken human being."
This was the umpteenth time I'd heard that.
Well, the first time I heard it from Baekho, I simply dismissed it, listening with one ear.
But…
Now, it's probably my fault.
I'm broken.
I've crossed the line, even by the standards of this savage world.
And as proof...
"Should I use Killing Intent?"
The Lion would have acted how after hearing those words.
My inner self was already whispering, "Interesting," and about to unleash Killing Intent.
It's convenient, and it helps me.
"Heh, why don't you stop it? I'll be forced to make it difficult for you. Know your place, Stag."
I simply observed the Jester's reaction, who, like a personal guard, stepped forward in the same vein.
"How amusing. Jester, even if you try to be cute, do you think he'd care?"
"I already know that, so it's not your concern. Heh, stop the nonsense and finish your turn already. Everyone's waiting."
At the Jester's urging to do his job, the Stag quietly rose from his seat.
"What's this? Oh, don't tell me you're just going to leave it at that?"
"Don't think I'll become your toy for entertainment until the very end, even to get something in return—"
"Then get out of here. Stop wasting time."
The Jester cut the Stag short, speaking coldly. The Stag stared at the Jester for a moment without a word.
And...
"This place wasn't meant to be like this."
He left, leaving those enigmatic words behind.
And once again, silence returned.
"Ahahaha… the atmosphere has gotten strange again!"
The Wolf laughed awkwardly, trying to break the frozen air.
"It's definitely true that everyone was lively when Master was here! But what can we do? He's not here."
Oh, what a Master-worshiper.
"Well, two people have left, but let's continue what we were doing. It would be a shame to end it like this, wouldn't it? We won't all get together like this again—."
"That reminds me… why don't we try what that Crescent Moon guy said?"
It was a suggestion from the Butterfly Mask, who had been watching the situation with an air of amusement.
"But this time, we'll answer honestly. Oh, of course, disclosing our identities is an exception. What do you say? It'll change the mood and be nice."
"I'm fine with that, but wouldn't disclosing one's identity be too subjective?"
"Come on, what's the problem with this gem? If you refuse to answer, just raise your hand here and say one word. Then you can tell if they're just making excuses or truly can't speak."
"Isn't it better to get consent first?"
The Queen pointed out a crucial point, cutting the Butterfly Mask off. The eye that peeked out from behind the mask curved into a long arc.
"Hee, you're like that again, sis."
"Why am I your sis?"
"It's obvious. You seem older than me."
"..."
The Queen, sadly, couldn't refute that.
Seeing the Queen like that, the Butterfly Mask, as if trying to do a vote, guided the conversation. Eventually, they decided to hold a vote.
And...
"Six votes in favor, two against."
Surprisingly, the majority vote passed.
The only ones who voted against were the Queen and the Black Mask.
"Lion, you voted yes…? Why?"
"Heh, Queen, do you still not know him? He'd want to do it because it'll be fun!"
It doesn't matter if it's fun or not.
I also had something I wanted to confirm before leaving the roundtable.
"Sigh… alright, I'll do it. But we need to set the rules beforehand."
Following the Queen's request, we spent a short time discussing and setting the rules.
"To sum it up, when it's your turn, the answerer will receive one question from everyone. The answerer will decide which question they'll answer. Does that work?"
"So, when do we start? Let's do it quickly. Sis?"
"…Fox, can we start now?"
"Yes, it's okay."
As soon as the Fox, who was in charge of answering, nodded, they took turns asking questions.
"I remember you didn't follow Master very well back then… is your heart still the same?"
It's the Wolf Mask, who mentions Master whenever they speak.
"I… I'll pass."
The Goblin simply passed.
In my eyes, who is adept at all sorts of trickery, it was a disappointing play. Instead of passing, it would've been better to ask a seemingly unimportant question, but in a way that sounds important, forcing the answerer to reply.
Anyway, after that, most of us, including myself, passed. As a result, the Fox received only two questions.
"I feel like you know too much about what happened on the first floor… are you inside?"
"Isn't that a little too much about my identity?"
"Come on, who would know which one of them it is?
"….Alright, I'll answer."
Once the question time was over, the Fox chose one out of the three questions.
"You asked if I still consider Master my benefactor."
"Oh, you chose my question."
"The answer is no. I didn't know Master was Auril Gavisse back then."
"Hmm… that man gained notoriety due to the wicked royal family's schemes. I understand. It's a shame."
And so, the Fox's turn ended.
Next was the Wolf, who received a total of four questions.
And...
"I shall answer the question Queen asked."
The Wolf chose the Queen's question.
"Queen is right. Auril Gavisse has the power to prevent Ghostbusters from shutting down."
As soon as I heard that, I knew it was crucial information.
"Translated differently, doesn't it mean that Auril Gavisse had a hand in the community's closure…?"
If that's the case, what is that old geezer scheming? I'm worried for no reason, but there's nothing I can do right now.
"Then it's Goblin's turn."
And so, Goblin's turn arrived.
Goblin received three questions, more than the Fox but one fewer than the Wolf.
And...
"I… I'll answer Fox's question…."
Goblin answered the question the Fox asked, ending their turn.
"The Pope of the Reatlass Church doesn't have much time left. The next Pope is almost confirmed to be a young saint…."
While it's insider information, not many were interested.
Maybe everyone just wanted to quickly get through their turns?
"Then it's finally Queen's turn, heh."
After the Goblin, the Queen, who received the most questions at five, answered what everyone was curious about.
"Since you all know a bit of the situation, I'll tell you. There's one mechanism needed to operate this spiritual world. And that mechanism started losing its power."
"…So, that's why it's shutting down?"
"Yes. I've looked for solutions, but I couldn't find any."
"Auril Gavisse… if he helps, then resurrection is possible…."
"Yes. But I don't think that will happen."
With those words, cutting off the possibility, the Queen's turn ended. Skipping the empty chair that was Crescent Moon's, it was the Butterfly Mask's turn.
"Hee… but I wonder if anyone has questions for me?"
Actually, this was the real reason I voted yes to this truth game.
There was something I desperately wanted to confirm from the Butterfly Mask.
However, instead of asking first, I watched the situation.
And of course...
"Yes, I have one."
The Fox immediately raised her hand, speaking the question I wanted to ask.
"I want to hear more about what you said about Misha Calstain being a traitor."
