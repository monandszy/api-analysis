##  The Third Record (1) 
Never once. Not in my entire life, had I met someone so perfect, someone who had never committed a single wrong.
Misha Calstain didn't believe such a person could exist. Even the greatest saints, she thought, would stumble occasionally. Their intentions might have been good, but circumstances could twist and lead to negative outcomes.
They too, undoubtedly, had hurt someone along the way.
Yes, that's just how it is. Even those exceptional individuals would make mistakes. If someone as great as them could err, it's only natural for a halfwit like me—.
“I…,” Misha Calstain murmured softly, “what am I even doing…?”
Days bled into weeks, with the same routine. Had I been facing off against monsters, it wouldn't be so bad. But stuck in my room all day, there was little I could do. I just wanted to shut my mind off, lie dormant like a corpse, but it wasn't something I could choose to do. 
So I spent each long day thinking, and thinking again. 
My thoughts were always different, yet always the same. I'd blame someone, loathe myself, and occasionally, like today, try to rationalize my actions. 
Ah, but the conclusion was always the same. 
“I have to leave.” 
Leave Clan Anabada. Not that I ever formally joined, but that makes leaving even easier.
After this expedition, when we return to the city, I'll leave. I'll disappear from Bjorn Jandel’s side, never to appear before him again.
He, too, would want that.
A conclusion reached hundreds of times, after hundreds of hours of agonizing. 
As I came to that same conclusion again, Misha Calstain huddled in on herself, clutching her chest with both hands.
“Ah…,” I moaned.
It hurt. Not just a tightness in my chest and difficulty breathing, but real, stabbing pain. I felt like I could alleviate the pain if I just closed my eyes and shoved something sharp into my chest. 
But Misha Calstain couldn't bring herself to translate that fantasy into reality. 
It wasn't out of a lack of courage.
It was simply because she knew:
‘I can’t do that…’.
He wouldn't want that ending. All the memories we shared, the happy times, would become tainted, twisted into painful memories that would haunt him.
‘Dwalki…’.
His face flashed before my eyes. 
The noble mage who sacrificed himself to save everyone in the labyrinth. Misha knew the feelings he harbored for her. Not from the beginning, but a long time after he left, from the dwarven warrior, Hikurod Murad.
He was secretly in love with me, he had said…
At first, I didn't believe it. If he had such feelings, why hide them?  Even until the last flicker of his candle dimmed?
I couldn't understand.
If it were me, I would have seized that last opportunity, confessing the emotions I’d kept hidden all along.
But Hikurod, upon hearing my question, simply replied:
‘Isn't it obvious what he thought? He didn't want to become a dark shadow in your life.’
It was an uncertain, speculative answer, but it made sense to me. I understood, not because I truly felt it, but because it felt possible for him to think like that. 
At least, it did until today. 
“It… must have felt like this……,” I whispered. 
Strictly speaking, I’m different from Dwalki. He sacrificed his life to save everyone, while I'm simply trying to find a way to escape, burdened by the weight of my mistakes. 
If this wasn’t a labyrinth… or if there was even a chance he might forgive me, I would have run away long ago—.
Knock, knock, knock.
A voice rang out from behind the closed door.
“It’s me, Misha. I need to talk to you.”
It was Bjorn. 
Joy and fear flooded over me at his visit, but I forced myself to calm down and attend to my responsibilities.
I couldn’t let him see me like this.
I washed my hair and quickly splashed water on my face. Then I swiftly tidied the messy room. Luckily, I hadn’t been doing anything in here, so there wasn’t much to clean. 
“Can I come in?”
The door swung open, and Bjorn, whom I hadn’t seen in a while, strode into the room.
My heart suddenly thumped.
Thump—
Why had he come? 
Was he just worried about me?
Does this room smell strange?
Moments ago, I had been withered like a wilted flower in this dark room, but his presence somehow infused me with life. 
***
“Before we talk, I want to turn this on. Can you grant me permission?”
If he’d come just to see my face, and had said something banal like that, I would have been relieved. But Bjorn went straight to the point as soon as he entered.
In his large hand, he held an object I knew well.
‘Broken Trust’.
The name attached to the object felt like a testament to the state of our relationship, unsettling me. 
But it also brought a surge of joy. 
This was my chance.
He, the one who had turned away from me so coldly that day, was giving me a chance. A golden opportunity to undo my wrongs and return to how we were before.
…And perhaps Bjorn too, deep down, wanted to go back to how things were.
“Sure… Go ahead. Start.”
That’s why Misha was determined not to miss this chance.
After all, how had we come to this? 
I would answer honestly, whatever Bjorn asked. 
With this resolve, I clenched my fists as Bjorn’s questions began.
“After I disappeared from Parune Island, how did you end up following Baekho?”
He started with questions I’d already answered, and then launched into a barrage of yes-or-no inquiries. Misha answered every question truthfully.
Bjorn now reminded me of a watchmaker I once saw. Like a watchmaker who took apart every component of a broken watch to find the source of the malfunction, Bjorn was scrutinizing every detail, no matter how trivial. 
“Did Baekho… happen to do anything to you?”
“Anything…?”
“You know… Like, touch you inappropriately or something…”
“…No! That didn’t happen! I swear on my life!”
Some of his questions felt unfair, even gratifying, but they weren’t the important part.
“Did you really not know that using the Stone of Resurrection would make you lose your memories?”
“I didn’t know…,” I replied.
“Then why did you hide it from me?”
“Like I said before… Baekho said if you knew, something bad would happen…,” I explained.
That was the part that had made Bjorn so angry that day.  He had accused me of believing Baekho’s words and hiding it from him.
The memory flashed before my eyes. I immediately blurted out the rest before Bjorn could even speak.
“I, I thought, ‘What’s the worst that could happen?’!”
“…The worst?”
“I, I didn’t know about the memory loss back then. Or even if I did, it wouldn’t have mattered. You dying is worse than anything…,” I pleaded.
“So you believed him?”
“…Baekho… he’s powerful. And he’s messed up in the head, you know.”
That was the real reason I had accepted Baekho's offer.
Because I didn’t know what he would do if I rejected it.  Perhaps he meant it when he said ‘something bad’ would happen.
So I took the Stone of Resurrection and went back to Bjorn. It was a tool to revive the one I loved, so there was no harm in having it.
But…
“Ugh… So that’s it?”
There was one more thing I hadn’t told him.
How on earth was I supposed to tell him?
What if this was the end of everything?
Despite my uncertainty, Misha closed her eyes and spoke.
“I, I agreed to give Baekho information in exchange for the Stone.”
“…Information?”
“He asked me to keep an eye on you…,” I said.
Misha kept one eye open, observing Bjorn’s reaction.  So far, there was more surprise in his expression than anger.
“O, Oh, don’t get me wrong! I haven’t given him any information yet. I haven’t seen him since that day we parted ways.”
“What if he had come looking for you? What would you have done?”
“…I don’t know. I’d give him the basics and then figure out what to do.”
Misha blurted out the answer, but it sounded too much like an excuse, so she quickly added,
“But… I probably would have given him something. You know… Really obvious, basic stuff!”
“Hmm…,” Bjorn muttered, letting out a long sigh as he stroked his chin.
Thankfully, he didn’t seem too angry.
He just nodded a few times, as if he was carefully taking in my answers, before moving on to the next question.
Time flew by.
“This is my last question.”
Bjorn looked into Misha’s eyes and spoke, “Are you hiding anything else from me?”
A question that encompassed everything. 
No, I hadn’t.  I had been honest about everything.
I needed to say that, but my lips only moved, unable to form a sound. 
“…,” the room fell silent.
The sense that our fractured relationship was slowly mending was shattered, replaced by a silence so heavy it couldn't be described as merely discomfort.
Bjorn simply mumbled two words. 
“Yes…,”
“…,”
“There is something.”
His murmur, tinged with resignation as if he had braced himself for this, made my breath catch.
Misha desperately wanted to speak.
No, I told you everything. 
I’m not hiding anything else.
But the words wouldn’t come.
Was it the object? Had it malfunctioned?
Misha, who truly had nothing to hide, was genuinely confused.
But…
‘Ah…’,
She realized.
‘Broken Trust’ is working as intended. It’s not broken. It’s functioning perfectly, even now.
The only reason the words wouldn’t come out was because there was something she wanted to hide from him.
“Tell…,” Bjorn began in the suffocating silence, “can’t you tell me?”
I felt it instinctively.
If I stayed silent, everything would be over. 
“…I, I’m not hiding anything related to Baekho.”
“Then?”
Bjorn’s gaze, still clinging to hope, made Misha take a deep breath.
“Then… you’re hiding something else, right?”
“Yes…,” she nodded, entranced, her mind filled with hesitations.
Could I really tell him? 
All this time I was gone, he had already surrounded himself with better people.
And I’d made promises to them…
Maybe me disappearing would be best for Bjorn.
“I…,” Misha started, but her lips opened on their own.
Moments ago, I had been unable to move them, no matter how hard I tried, but now they parted, releasing a truth stained with years of regret.
“I lied to you back then, Bjorn.”
“…?”
Bjorn’s eyebrows rose at the word ‘lie’.
He had always been like that.
He hated being lied to.
And this was a situation where I had to reveal the truth.
Yes, I had to…
‘This isn’t cowardice.’
With a sigh, Misha pushed away the last vestiges of her lingering hope.
It was something she had wanted to say on Parune Island.
She had tried to bury her feelings, but knowing he might die made her want to be honest. 
“I said I thought it was best if we just stayed as colleagues.”
It had taken an agonizingly long time, but she had finally said it.
“That was a lie.”
It’s never too late to say what needs to be said, they say.
Hadn’t she heard those words once?
“You know… Back then, I never got to answer you.”
Misha raised her head, locking eyes with him, her voice clear and steady.
“Bjorn Jandel. I… like you, too.”
Words she hadn’t been able to say when she first realized his feelings, overwhelmed by the situation at the time.
No response came, but she continued.
“That day you told me, too…,”
“Even before you said those words…,”
“And…,” 
Misha, in a voice barely above a whisper, spoke with certainty,
“I still do…,”
It was the only thing she had been hiding from him.
***
There are days when I feel strangely off. Bright, sunny days, yet with a dark cloud looming, ready to unleash a torrential downpour. 
Today was one of those days for Erwen.
“Uncle! You’re awake… Huh?”
She had raced in, excited to greet him, only to find an empty room.
From that moment, Erwen felt a gnawing unease.
She searched the entire mansion, but Bjorn was nowhere to be found.
“The Clan Leader? I don’t believe so… He didn’t say he was going anywhere. Perhaps he is still inside the mansion?”
“…Really? I’ve searched everywhere, but he’s not there.”
“Hmm, maybe he is out for a bit, on some errand…,” Anabada’s navigator, Auyen Lochrov, tried to reassure her, but Erwen’s lips felt dry.
There was one room she hadn't checked yet.
‘Misha Calstain.’
The reason she had avoided checking her room was simple: Bjorn wouldn’t be in there.  Plus, lately, there was a strange tension between them.
She had been in her room constantly, moping, as if protesting.
It was all so confusing.
Thump, thump. 
Even though she knew Bjorn wouldn’t be in there, why did she find herself drawn to this place?
Thump.
Despite it all, she had a nagging sense of unease.
Thump. 
Overcome by those unsettling feelings, Erwen arrived at her destination.  A room tucked away in a corner on the third floor of the mansion. The door was shut tight.
She almost knocked, but then thought better of it.  If Bjorn wasn’t there, it would be awkward.
‘There’s no magic energy, so I’m sure he’s not inside.’
There was no voice activation or soundproofing.
In other words, if she wanted to, she could hear every sound coming from inside the room. 
Erwen, who normally consciously suppressed her enhanced hearing, opened it up completely.
And then she heard it.
“Bjorn Jandel. I… like you, too.”
A familiar voice reached her ears. She recognized the voice immediately, but the words themselves were incomprehensible.
What… was she saying?
Worried she’d misheard, Erwen strained to listen harder.
“That day you told me, too…,”
“Even before you said those words…,”
“And… I still do…,”
Her mind still couldn’t grasp it.
This was a confession, wasn’t it?
Something she had never even thought of doing…
‘What is she even thinking…?’
Erwen was shocked and angry.
This was the woman who had disappeared after she heard about Bjorn’s death, without even bothering to avenge him. 
Bjorn, so naive and kind, was trying to take care of her out of past affection, but Erwen hadn’t forgotten what she did.
But…
[Bjorn Jandel. I… like you, too.]
Those first words kept echoing in her ears.
Erwen finally noticed something strange.
‘I… too?’
The feline-like human clearly said ‘I… too’.
And ‘I… too’ is used to express agreement when hearing the same sentiment.
Which meant….
‘…Uncle said it first?’
Was it because the idea was so unbelievable?
The anger that had been simmering in her head suddenly cooled.
As the heat subsided, she was finally able to see the situation more objectively.
A smile crept onto her face. 
This was all a figment of that woman’s imagination.
She was lost in a fantasy, having a conversation with Bjorn.
The fact that no further conversation could be heard after that last phrase was proof. 
‘But… I feel sorry for her.’
Her actions were unfathomable to most, but Erwen could understand, having done something similar when she was feeling emotionally distressed.
‘Ugh… so where is Uncle?’
Erwen turned away, as if she had come here and heard something she shouldn’t have.  She was about to return her enhanced hearing to normal.
Or rather, she was about to.
“…That’s right.”
A familiar voice echoed from inside the room.
