## Chapter 507: Underground Floor 1 (3)
Let's get one fact straight: they'll die. 
The moment Verzak appears here, 70% of the explorers will have their last adventure today. 
Of course, that's assuming they run away immediately upon seeing Verzak. 
If they decide to fight, then everyone will be sharing their last adventure together. 
"Are these guys even aware of the value of their lives?" 
I can't fathom their stupidity. 
Verzak has been summoned, and yet more people continue to arrive.
“…Indeed, there seem to be more.” 
A group of ten-odd explorers, their team completely battered after stumbling through a maze of traps, arrived in a sorry state. 
The first thing they did upon seeing us was ask:
“Is the portal open? Is it open, by any chance?”
“Haven't you heard? The Ninth Terror has been defeated, and Verzak has been summoned!” 
Are they truly insane? 
They chose to come here, to the first floor, instead of going to the second, solely on the basis of that slim possibility. 
The ones already here might be waiting on this floor since Verzak was summoned, but those newcomers are completely clueless. 
I let out a dry chuckle as Amelia casually walked beside me.
“…Yandel, what do we do?”
“I don't know. I think I underestimated the explorers' greed.”
“You didn't underestimate the explorers, you underestimated humanity. These kinds of people exist in every era, every place.”
These days, talking to Amelia feels like conversing with a sage. 
Except, this time, her advice wasn't particularly helpful. 
So what am I supposed to do? If you knew this would happen, why not give me some advice beforehand?
“Huu…”. 
Calm down. 
This is a difficult situation, but I can't lash out at my companions. 
It's wiser to find a solution instead of wasting my energy on pointless anger.
“The biggest issue is that, with so many people, opening the portal will be difficult…”
The moment it opens, these guys will hop on the bandwagon and leech off the rewards.
They'll be siphoning away my profits, of course. 
“Most importantly, word will get out.”
Even if we're the only ones allowed to enter due to a limited headcount, the fact that we found this hidden area will spread throughout the city. 
From the next expedition onwards, we'll have to deal with tailing and interference, a whole heap of trouble. 
I wanted to quietly siphon rewards, but it seems that dream won't come true.
However…
“The Watcher of the Abyss! Verzak! That monstrous beast is here!”
This means I can't afford to sit back and think of a solution. 
The moment they see it, Verzak is practically guaranteed to appear.
“Ugh, ugh! Get, get away from me!”
“Don't push!”
“Uwaaaaaaaah!” 
The moment the Watcher of the Abyss manifested among the explorers, chaos erupted. 
They knew that attracting the monster's attention would result in their deaths. 
The explorers, all barely 9th-grade, were just trying to get away from a mere 9th-grade monster. 
The Watcher of the Abyss, heedless of the high-ranking explorers, casually flicked its attacks towards them.
Flick!
Oh, by the way, its basic attack was spitting. 
A venomous liquid shot out from its eyes like a water gun. 
“Ugh! Get out of my way! I said get out!”
Watching it unfold, I couldn't help but feel a sense of absurdity. 
High-ranking explorers, at least 6th-grade, panicking over a single 9th-grade monster. 
What kind of comedy is this?
I was observing the scene from a few steps away. 
Fwoop-!
An explorer got hit in the eye and, in a panic, swung their arm, striking the Watcher of the Abyss.
And immediately.
Wooooosh!
The Watcher of the Abyss vanished in a flash of light.
“…...”
“…...”
The chaos ended, replaced by a heavy silence.
“Ah, ah… No…”. // Poor guy
The explorer who killed the Watcher of the Abyss trembled, realizing the significance of their actions. 
Simultaneously, the situation took a turn for the worse.
“Get, get out of here!”
A voice shouted, I couldn't tell who it was. 
The explorers began pushing that particular explorer away, frantic.
“If you stay here, Verzak, that beast, will come! Get to the second floor!”
“B, but I… I can't possibly reach the second floor by myself…”
“You idiot, why did you kill it?”
Oh my god, are these explorers all psychopaths? 
“Stop it.”
I couldn't stand it anymore and intervened.
“Baron Yandel…?”
“…Baron! If he’s here, we’ll all die! We must chase him away!”
Such ridiculous logic. 
Are they suggesting they wouldn't die if he wasn't here? 
As long as the Watcher of the Abyss exists, Verzak will come eventually. 
Anyway, seeing their reactions confirms my suspicions. 
They won't willingly leave for the second floor, even if we wait here.
So…
“I said stop.”
“But—!”
“I will be opening the portal now.”
Plan B, again.
“…!” 
The moment I said that and took a step forward, the explorers pressed themselves against the wall, making way for me. 
The same was true for the explorers who were standing next to the stele.
“All of you, get out of here.”
“…Yes? Ah, yes! Everyone, get out! Don't hinder us!”
My words were met with shock. 
It seemed opening the portal had a significant impact. 
The room where the stele was was completely empty after I said just that.
“Bersil, can you make this side invisible? And, uh, muffle the sound too.”
Bersil cast a barrier that concealed the inside from the outside using magic. 
Okay, at least our privacy is somewhat secured. 
I was about to begin when Amelia spoke to me.
“Yandel, are you sure about this?”
“What other choice do we have? I can't just leave them all to die.”
“You could wait a little longer, wouldn't you? Even the most reckless explorer knows their own life is precious.”
Well, I did consider that…
“But I don't think they'll abandon this place, even if we wait.”
“…You're surprisingly calm.”
Well… to be honest, I'm closer to resignation than calm.
If this works and the portal actually opens, I can imagine the countless free riders following us, and the thought makes my stomach churn, even gives me a headache.
However…
“If this method is wrong, then we’ll have to escape to the second floor to avoid Verzak.  It’s risky to waste any more time.”
I explained the real reason for this decision, and Amelia, seemingly understanding, remained silent.
Therefore, with the fragments I collected from the third floor in hand, I approached the stele. 
I stopped in front of it and issued a new order.
“Bersil, cast the Binding magic on everyone except you.”
“What?”
“If the portal truly opens, there’s a good chance of gaining Merit points.”
“Ah…!”
Bersil, seemingly understanding, cast the Binding magic again without complaint. 
Magic users don't really need experience points anyway.
“Done.”
Huu… there goes that. 
“Please, please work.”
I gulped down my saliva and placed my hand on the stele.
And at that moment.
Wooooooooosh!
The air swirled around the stele, unleashing a dazzling array of multicolored light.
“You have successfully opened the portal to the hidden area for the first time. EXP +99”
Yes! This is it.
***
The portal has opened. 
A portal leading to an unknown space, one that no one in the long history of the abyss has dared to enter. 
As a result, I feel a surge of mixed emotions.
However, for now, I'll proceed as planned.
“Bersil, cast the Binding magic again.”
“How?”
“You, Erwen, and Bersil are Team 1.  The rest are Team 2.  If the portal closes after we enter, Team 2 will immediately go to the second floor.  Amelia, your role is crucial… Can you do it?”
“Don’t worry. The moment they see the portal close, these guys will come to their senses.  I’ll convince them to go to the second floor together; it’s the safest option.”
“Okay…  If someone follows us and starts from a different location, you’ll have to handle it, alright?”
“I’ll do my best.”
Alright, this is a pretty decent backup plan…
“I'll go first.”
I cautiously stepped into the portal.
Flash!
The intense light flooded over my eyelids, momentarily blinding me.  A feeling of weightlessness followed, and then my vision returned.
“You have entered the Underground Floor 1 Records Vault.”
“This is your first achievement.”
“Your great feat will be forever etched in the Stone of Honor.”
I’m used to traversing portals, so I quickly regained my balance and landed on the floor.
Kuuung-!
Raising my shield to protect my upper body, I swiftly surveyed my surroundings.
The floor tiles are made of rock. 
Visibility is roughly 100 meters, but there’s nothing particularly noteworthy beyond that. 
Only rugged rocky terrain stretches out. 
And…
Wooooooooosh!
Is that the sound of waves…?
“I don’t see any monsters yet.”
Just as that thought crossed my mind, a burst of light exploded from above, and my companions followed me in.
“…!”
“Uh, whoa!”
First came Erwen and Bersil, members of Team 1. 
And…
“Uwaaaaaaaaaaah!” 
Ainar’s earsplitting scream was followed by Auyen, Misha, and Amelia. 
“Thankfully, the portal didn’t close yet.” 
I was relieved, but then I realized something else.
“…There’s no exit.” 
Just like when I entered the Rift, the portal that had opened for a moment closed again after spitting us out.
***
It’s a one-way street. There's no way to go back to where we were. 
I felt a strange sense of dread, but I decided to focus on the positive.
“Nothing much has changed.”
The first floor closes on the seventh day, no matter what. 
And naturally, we won’t be able to go up after that. 
“The question is… when will this floor close?”
It’s the type of information we’ll need to find out during our exploration.
I turned to Amelia, putting those thoughts aside.
“Amelia, how was the situation when you entered?”
“Same as before.  Only the color of the portal was different.  It was the same as any other portal.  Once Gould’s barrier disappears, other explorers will start coming down.”
Hm, alright…
“Everyone, be vigilant and check your current status. If you notice any changes, no matter how trivial, report them to me immediately.”
“Byorn!  My, my body feels strange!”
“Strange? Where?”
“Uh, my face is hot, and my heart is beating rapidly.”
…That’s because you're excited.
I was checking my team’s condition and observing if there were any special features of this field when explorers started pouring in from above.
“Oh! New floor! A new floor!”
“Khahaha! My name will be etched in history!”
A few of them seemed a little off, but some were relatively normal.
“Everyone, be alert!  We don’t know what might appear, so stay vigilant!”
They immediately grouped with their companions and prepared.
I’m not sure if it’s intentional, but they’re all gathering around us, keeping a respectable distance.
Are they thinking it's safer to be near us?
I’m not sure, but thankfully, the influx of explorers subsided quickly.
And…
“Wh, what? Why aren’t they coming in?”
“Ah, Ms. Zeltin hasn’t arrived yet…”
“Kurdo!  Lord Kurdo hasn’t come yet either!”
One new piece of information came to light. 
Unlike other portals connecting to other floors, this portal closes once a specific condition is met.
What might that condition be? 
“It doesn’t seem like there’s a time limit…”
I quickly counted the number of people who had entered.
Let’s see, we have one, two, three, four, five, six…
“Fifty-eight, fifty-nine, sixty…”
Ah, so the portal closes when there are 60 people.
