## Chapter 731: The Traitor (5)
Ricardo Ruhenpraha.
Our conversation with him ended abruptly, unfortunately. 
“Don’t even think about dying gracefully.” 
He remained silent, a mockery in his voice, a final jest, refusing to answer any further questions. Perhaps he was using the "ignore and continue" tactic, but even after careful consideration, I couldn’t see it that way. 
"It’s more likely he’s just so enraged he smashed his radio."
Yes, that explanation is far more reasonable. His trembling voice, a stark contrast to his usual composure, couldn't have been faked. 
There’s also another piece of evidence supporting this theory. 
After all, who is this man? 
He was once known as the “Sword Saint” and now holds the position of leader in the infamous terrorist organization, Orculls. It’s natural to assume he’s incredibly powerful and…
“These guys are all the same.”
He’s the complete opposite of someone who appears tough but is actually soft on the inside. 
Statistics show that these bigwigs lack the fortitude for this type of confrontation. They’ve never encountered anyone audacious enough to call them out like this.
Well, except for Baekho. He’s undoubtedly a force to be reckoned with, but he’s Korean.
“I wonder if he’s having a meltdown right now?”
Of course, this is just wishful thinking, far from a certainty.
Still, my actions weren't entirely pointless. 
At least I managed to elicit a response from him, a dialogue. That alone should be enough to ease Amelia's burden, even if it’s just a little—.
“Chizzizik—!”
Suddenly, static filled the radio, followed by a familiar voice.
“Lord Chancellor…?”
The code-filled message was incomprehensible to me. I gestured to Vivienne to translate, and she quickly responded.
“…It’s the Lord Chancellor. He’s telling all the commanders to log out of the current channel.”
So, is this the end of the radio eavesdropping? 
It wasn’t a disappointment.  
It was a predictable outcome the moment I started baiting him. 
However, the messages that followed were confusing.
“Brett Chi, Saela Sa.”
“Tiri Bi, Saela Sa.”
“Tiri Ai, Saela Sa.”
“What are they saying?”
“It’s just a standard procedure. They’re mentioning the area code and then saying ‘communication ends.’”
“Should we log out, too…?  It doesn’t sound like anything useful will be said anymore. The number of people connected to the network is decreasing rapidly, and…”
“No, stay put. Just in case.”
Vivienne gave me a dubious look, but followed my instructions without complaint. 
After a while...
“It’s quiet.”
“There are only two people left on the network.”
So, excluding us, there’s only one person left.
“Give it to me.”
I snatched the radio from Vivienne.
“What are you doing?”
“He’s probably about to contact us.”
“…Do you know who it is?”
Even without the crystal’s destruction, the Orculls’ communication network has a security system that automatically disconnects users when their associated authority figure dies.
And yet, one person remains.
What does that mean?
“It’s obvious who it is.”
And as expected, just a few seconds later, a voice echoed through the radio.
“Tch.”
A sound that invoked countless thoughts.
“Long time no see, Lord Chancellor. Or should I say, the head of the rebel army?”
I greeted him before he could even introduce himself. To my surprise, he casually responded.
“Quiet for a while, weren’t you?  Getting into trouble right away after showing up, it's so typical of you.”
It felt like we were close friends who had been chatting just a few days ago. 
“Well, you wouldn’t be the one talking about trouble, would you?”
“Hm, I suppose not, this time.”
Despite being enemies, a smile crept onto my face. 
But there wasn’t time for idle chitchat.
“Why?”
“You always go straight for the answer.”
“I’m not one to enjoy wasting time.”
“You won’t get to the answer that way. The answer is like treasure hidden deep within a labyrinth, something that can only be found after a long, arduous search.”
Oh, is it because he’s older than me?
It’s a profound statement, I must admit.
But…
“What are you talking about? You wouldn’t know about labyrinths; you’ve never been in one.”
A veteran explorer needs to say that with a hint of cool, like a seasoned traveler.
For example, a nation, like mine.
“Let me get straight to the point.”
“Are you trying to sweet-talk me into something?”
To my question, he neither confirmed nor denied.  
Instead, he immediately presented his conditions, like an impatient businessman.
“I guarantee the absolute safety of your companions.”
“How can I trust someone who’s trying to kill us?”
“I actually gave my entire army orders. ‘Capture’ Bjorn Yandell’s companions. ‘Alive’ was the highest priority.”
I looked at Vivienne, silently asking for confirmation. She nodded. 
“I always seemed to be drawn to you. I figured if I captured your comrades, there might be some use for them down the line.”
Hm…
An enemy overestimating me is not a good sign…
But thanks to him, I learned something. 
None of my companions have been captured by the rebels yet. If they had, he would have threatened me, not tried to sweet-talk me. 
“So, your answer?”
The Duke’s question was met with Astarotta’s piercing gaze. It wasn’t an attempt to interfere, but rather a detached observation of my decision.
“Sigh…”
My response was predetermined. 
“I refuse.”
“Why?”
The Duke, like me before, went straight for the answer. 
But I wouldn’t waste time on pointless chatter like he did.
I’d endured too long for this moment.  This moment to say these words to his face.
“It’s because of a promise I made at Isrock.”
“...”
“I said I would break the neck of the bastard who orchestrated this whole mess.”
I may appear rough, but I hold grudges.
That’s why I’ve never once crossed a name off my kill list.
“Well, I suppose so.”
After a brief pause, the Duke continued in a voice laced with bittersweet resignation.
“We’re all wrong from the very first step.”
He spoke of surrender, devoid of justification or self-defense.  I could sense a hint of regret in his voice, fueling my irritation.
If we knew this was how things would end up…
“I’d rather it not have happened at all.”
“As you know, the first step was yours.”
Without realizing it, I spoke in a rather aggressive tone, but the Duke didn’t react.
Instead, he chuckled.
“Heh, it’s not unusual. My life is like a tangled thread, the more I try to unravel it, the more it twists.”
Is he looking back on his life now?
Well, I guess if I were fighting the Royal Family, I’d be doing the same.
Whatever the case, I had only one more question before ending this pointless exchange.
“What happened to Ragna Peprock?”
It could be considered a very personal question.
But to my surprise, he answered truthfully.
“The child sleeps, unaware, in the safest place in the world. When he awakens, the threads will be tied in one way or another.”
“The safest place in the world…  Wherever that is, it’s a far cry from the treatment he’s getting at home.”
“Don’t you know why? You must.”
Well, that’s true.
The Duke’s son is a Devil Spirit.
That’s why he brought Ragna, who had been hiding in the library, to the palace in the first place.
Oh, I almost forgot, I had something else I wanted to ask.
“…The woman in the portrait in the hidden room in your office, is she Ragna’s mother?”
“That’s right. She was a good woman.”
Why is he so forthcoming today?
That thought crossed my mind, but unfortunately, that was the end of the conversation.
“Well, the situation is now clear.”
“When was it not?”
“Ha, but it’s significant for me. The possibility, that thought... that thought has made me a man of no consequence.”
One could dismiss it as an old man’s rambling, but it sounded like the words of someone on the verge of enlightenment, and I wasn’t particularly thrilled about it.
“I will revoke the capture orders given to my entire army once we end this conversation.  I will order a full-scale slaughter.”
Is this the beginning of something truly significant?
“In the process, one of your precious companions might die. No, it’s certain. I will make it happen.”
“If you’re trying to threaten me, you’re going about it the wrong way.”
“Isn’t that obvious?”
“…”
“It’s not a threat.”
He spoke as if merely stating facts.
“I just wanted to let you know, you and I are not so different.”
Paradoxically, for the first time, I felt a sense of awe while speaking with the Duke. 
“Do you know how much I’ve suffered, forced to smile in the presence of your kind?”
“...”
“You need to feel it too, the pain I’ve felt.”
Huh, I never knew he had this kind of masculine side.
***
The communication with the Duke ended with his last words.
“He logged out…”
Confirming that only one person remained on the network, I tossed the useless radio into the burning house.
“Don’t worry too much. It’s just the curse of a traitor.”
Astarotta offered words of comfort.
“You made the right choice.”
The right choice…
Yes, it must have been. 
If I had accepted the Duke’s offer, no one would have died during this war, but after the war, a much bigger storm would have brewed.
“So, as a reward, can I have some answers now?  Why did the Duke start this war?”
“Impossible. His Majesty ordered me to keep it a secret.”
Ugh, he’s driving me insane. 
Is this some kind of game where I have to solve everything through quests?
“Ah, but that’s actually the case.”
Now I can say for sure.
“Dungeon & Stone” is a terrible game.
“A lot of them have gathered already.”
As I grumbled to myself, Astarotta looked around and muttered.
He meant we should be moving soon.
So, I put the Lord Chancellor out of my mind and made a quick assessment of the current situation.
A burning city. 
The rebel forces have been ordered to stay at a distance from me. Their numbers are increasing with each passing moment as reinforcements arrive. 
“And I have no idea if Ruhenpraha is coming after me.”
Not only is Amelia’s safety in the 4th District unknown, but it’s also unclear if the Clan members who have taken shelter in the Sanctuary are safe.
To make matters worse, the Duke, after undergoing some sort of bizarre awakening event, declared he would kill all my comrades...
[The Devil Spirit, ‘———’, from the otherworld, lost three companions and finally realized his path.]
I don’t even know if that event mentioned in the records will happen during this war.
But that's not all.
[Arua Raven! Your former comrade, the mage, is a traitor!]
Vivienne pointed the finger at Raven as the person who would betray me on the day the Capital burns. 
“How come I can’t seem to get my thoughts straight?”
I was trying to quickly summarize everything, but my mind was in chaos.
“…”
My head feels like it's going to explode. 
There’s so much I need to keep in mind. 
I wish I could just go back to the Labyrinth and live day by day, oblivious to everything.
“Thump—!”
A sharp pain constricted my chest as intense stress took hold.
But that’s why I clear my head. 
Like a true Barbarian.
“…I’m sure things will work out somehow.”
Besides, didn’t the Duke say it himself? 
He said that after wandering long enough, you’ll eventually find the answer.
So, I’ll focus on this moment and push through.
“Behel—laaaaaaaaaa!!”
Just like the old days, when all I had was this body.
