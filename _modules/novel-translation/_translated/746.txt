747화 길잡이 (3)
The Eastern Branch, sheltering thirty-seven refugees. Sven Parab decided to first dispel the palpable apprehension in their eyes.  It wasn't a particularly difficult task.
“Greetings! My name is Sven Parab.  While I am not currently, I was formerly a full-fledged Knight of the Leathras Order, and now operate independently as a member of the Anabada Clan!”
Even if “formerly,” the title of Knight of the Leathras Order held weight.  Coupled with the current affiliation with the Anabada Clan—the most renowned clan in recent times—the effect was immediate.
“……Anabada?  That’s Baron Yandel’s clan!”
“I'm not sure about that, but a Knight! My God… this is such a relief!”
“But there’s no guarantee that what he says is true…”
“Hey, shut up! See that woman over there? I don't know her name, but I clearly saw her at the victory parade. She was definitely with Baron Yandel!”
“We… we’re saved…!”
It didn't take long for the apprehension in the refugees' eyes to be replaced with relief. However, once a person's guard is down, they tend to become more talkative.
“Excuse me, Knight? What’s happened outside?”
“Have you seen a boy about this big?”
“What will happen to us now?”
“Did the Royal Family send you to rescue us?”
Dozens of questions poured forth from the refugees’ mouths.  The atmosphere became chaotic, bordering on overwhelming, yet Sven Parab remained unflappable, answering as best he could.
“The war continues outside.  The Royal Army has advanced to Sector 7; we must await further developments.”
“I'm sorry. I haven’t seen a boy of that description.”
“For now, we should hold out here and observe the situation.”
“……Sadly, we weren’t sent by the Royal Family to save you. We simply sought shelter from the war, just like you.”
The refugees’ flickering hope dimmed at this brutally honest reply.  Yet, to Parab, this was preferable. There’s nothing crueler than fostering false hope.
“Not sent by the Royal Family…?”
“Damn it!”
“Well, it did seem strange. How would the Royal Family know we were here?”
“Even if they did, they wouldn’t send anyone.  Didn't you see? Fire rained down on us! The Royal Family doesn't care if we live or die!”
Anger rapidly replaced the diminished hope. Of course, not everyone reacted this way.
“I’m actually relieved they’re not connected to the Royal Family.”
“If they’re Baron Yandel’s associates… then we can trust them.”
“Yes! Having a Knight and a mage with us is incredibly reassuring. We were so worried before…”
These few remained remarkably optimistic compared to the enraged majority. Though, he did wonder why those who claimed to be worried hadn't even locked the front door…
“Ha, ha ha…”
Sven Parab chuckled awkwardly, remaining silent.  That was inconsequential for now.
“To assess the situation, are there any explorers among you?”
Having subtly asserted his authority by revealing his identity, Sven Parab proceeded to assess their capabilities. However, the results were underwhelming.
“…….”
“…….”
The refugees only rolled their eyes at the question about explorers.  But their gazes subtly shifted to one particular person, as if they had something to say but were hesitant. When Parab looked in the direction of their collective gaze, a middle-aged man avoided his eyes and cleared his throat.
“…I, I've been in a few labyrinths in my younger days! But I’m long retired!”
“Yes, I see.”
One retired explorer…  And he didn't mention it initially because he was afraid we might ask him to do something dangerous?
“Sir, you say a few labyrinths?!  You told us you were famous back in the day!”
“Ahem, my dear!  Even so, how can we compare ourselves to Baron Yandel’s associates?”
“May I ask your rank before retirement?”
“It… it was Rank 7.”
“I see.”
Sven Parab slowly nodded. He entrusted the management of the refugees to the retired Rank 7 explorer. It seemed more practical than using him as combat power.
“We need to fortify the place, could you assist with that?”
“Anything you need, Knight!”
“Then please gather things that can block the door. Chairs, desks, wardrobes…”
Sven Parab then locked the front door and erected a barricade, completing the minimum preparations.
“Mr. Parab, setting up defenses is good, but what about an escape route in case things go south?”
“We could escape through the windows, couldn’t we?”
“But the windows are all on the second floor. We could manage, but others would find it difficult—the elderly, the children…”
“That’s…”
Parab trailed off at Marone’s words.  To refute her was impossible, as she was correct; to agree meant accepting the implication.  Furthermore, he was quietly contemplating something else.  If things escalated, the entire area around the temple would be swarming with enemies. Would escaping with thirty-seven combat-ineffective refugees even be possible?
His conclusion was simple.  Within the temple, where the Leathras statue stood.  A former Knight, who once served that goddess in the closest proximity, wouldn't—
That wasn’t possible.  I’m not some monster like Bjorn Yandel. I can’t do it. Yes, therefore…
“There's little need to contemplate escape. It's unlikely that enemies would reach this far… and simply securing this place will resolve the issue.”
“Yes… that’s true. If we can properly secure this place, there’s no need to flee…”
Marone, equally lacking a better answer, didn't object but began inscribing a defensive magic circle in front of the door.
“Whew…”
Watching her, Parab turned and walked aimlessly.
“Where are you going?”
“I’m going to take a look around and familiarize myself with the building’s layout.”
“Ah, I see…!”
That was a pretext; he had no need to assess the building's structure.  Most temples are built according to standard specifications. The location of the first-floor chapel, the staircase leading to the second floor—all were familiar to his eyes. Even the administrative and clerical quarters on the second floor were identical to those of other smaller branches.
Thump, thump.
After a complete circuit of the building, he returned to the first-floor chapel, where all the chairs had been removed for the barricade, and sat on the bare floor. He felt the need for a rest. Did his appearance seem different to the others?
“…….”
“…….”
The refugees, who had previously approached him wherever he went, now cautiously avoided him.  He found this peculiar for a moment.  He opened his eyes and gazed forward. The Leathras statue was directly in front of him.
‘…Do they think I’m praying?’
That’s ironic. Although he held the title of Knight for a long time, he was far from devout.
‘The Star Goddess…’
Looking at the statue, said to govern adventure and fate, he asked.
‘What is it you desire of me?’
No answer came, of course.  Only silence.
“…….”
“…….”
A silence born of the refugees’ consideration for his potential prayer.  Peeking through his lashes, he saw them all with eyes closed, some making the sign of the cross.
Slowly, Sven Parab closed his eyes.  And like making a wish upon a passing comet, he murmured.
‘Please, just let me live.  Okay?’
He was no different from the other refugees.
***
Fifteen clans in total, including Anabada.  Aside from one Rank 7 explorer in a special position, all were at least Rank 6 explorers, totaling exactly 207. Originally there were more, but many explorers whose ranks had dropped died on the way here, leaving only this many. Anyway…
Adding 800 elite barbarian warriors handpicked by Ainar and myself, we assembled a force exceeding a thousand.  It’s not a large army given the circumstances…
‘…Can’t be helped.’
Increasing numbers would only increase casualties. So, I even dissuaded warriors who wanted to partake in the great battle, citing the protection of the sanctuary, and selected only the elite—.
“The preparations are complete.”
“Is that so?  You’ve worked hard.”
Upon hearing Bersil’s report that everything was ready, I stood before the sanctuary gate, where the debris had been cleared.  And…
‘…It’s tedious, but unavoidable.’
Looking at the thousand-strong force awaiting my command, I spoke.
“We will advance to Sector 7.”
I didn't shout, but with everyone attentive, my words carried clearly. I continued in a calm voice.
“Some will surely die, others will survive, fighting the enemy.”
Too realistic, too disheartening for a pre-battle commander’s address.  I knew it, but there was no other way.
“Some will lose husbands, others fathers.”
When did it start? I no longer wanted to deceive people with sweet words, to feed them empty hopes.
“Therefore, you must know!”
“If you kill the enemy, why you kill!”
“If you are killed by the enemy, why you risked your life!”
Overcome with a sudden surge of emotion, I shouted.
“I go to Sector 7 to protect my loved ones! Why are *you* going to Sector 7?”
The answers would vary.
“Because I can’t leave our chieftain alone!”
Some would follow out of respect.
“Because I will become a great warrior!”
Some for glory.
“Ha ha! You said this is my chance to gain merit!”
Some driven by base desire.
“Those bastards need to get out of here so my family can sleep soundly!”
Others, like me, wishing to protect their loved ones—that’s war.
“While your desires differ, our goals are the same. Therefore, we will walk the same path, fighting side-by-side, back-to-back.”
I promised.
“I will lead the charge, ahead of all.”
“I will remember what you fought and died for.”
Yes, therefore…
“Follow me. Entrust your hopes to me.”
No further words were needed. This land demanded combat for survival.
“Behel—raaaaaaaaaaaaa!”
I simply took the first step.
***
Finally entering Sector 7.  Despite the chaos of war, I ran through the familiar streets.
Firmly.  Weapons in hand.
“Behel—raaaaaaaaaaaaa!”
“Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!”
“Protect me!”
“Nia Rapdonia……!!!”
Each one letting out their battle cry in their own way.
“Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!”
As we ran through the deserted streets, we soon spotted a group presumed to be Noirk soldiers in the distance.  About ten of them.  They seemed to be stationed to monitor our sanctuary…
“Emergency! Emergency!  A force of about a thousand has left the sanctuary! Bjorn Yandel is leading!”
Frantically transmitting a message, they fled without daring to stop us.  It wouldn't have helped anyway.  There's a saying, isn’t there? If you see a bear in the wild from afar, it’s already too late.
「Erwin Fornatchi di Tersia has cast [Rupture].」
「James Cala has cast [Piercing Light].」
「Bersil Goulend has cast a Rank 4 offensive magic…”
The snipers on my shoulders utilized the high ground advantage to pick off the fleeing men from afar.  This, I call Barbarian Bunker Mode. Oh, by the way, among the ranged attackers in the bunker was Rothmiller.
Thwack!
Oh, hitting the head with a crossbow from this distance? It didn’t seem to be a skill-based shot either.
“…Your skill has improved, hasn’t it?”
“Crossbow practice was the easiest thing to do in the city.”
It's true, you need an opponent to practice swordsmanship.
“But… am I really supposed to be here?”
Rothmiller seemed to be still struggling to accept his role in Barbarian Bunker Mode. Or rather, worried about it.
“I’ll try my best, but my presence might just be a hindrance.”
“It’s fine. I decided to put you here.”
I was the one who placed Rothmiller there. It couldn’t be helped. He insisted on following, saying he could be useful, and I couldn't refuse.  I just included him in my bunker mode to be safe.  It’s the most dangerous position at the front line…
‘But it's within my line of sight.’
I judged that I could handle any contingency.  And Rothmiller proved to be far more than a mere decoration.
“That way! I have a ‘hunch’ that way is dangerous!”
I had momentarily forgotten, but Rothmiller, having consumed the essence of a mimic, possesses an exceptionally high ‘hunch’ stat.  Therefore, Rothmiller’s navigational skills, which were my first guiding star, remain effective.  Thanks to him, I didn't need to worry about choosing the right path.
“Then we should go that way.”
“…What? You just said that way is dangerous?”
Um…
“…I'm saying we should go that way.”
“……?”
“We came here to fight.”
We need to go to dangerous places to find enemies.
