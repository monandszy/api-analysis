## Chapter 401: Icerock (2)
The investigation revealed that two individuals had changed their names. However, neither of these names was “Meljeri” or “Dick,” names that were far removed from the cursed one. In simpler terms, Hans was not among them.
Yet, what was this strange feeling I was experiencing? “It feels weird that he isn’t here, after all…” While I was relieved to learn Hans was not alive, there was also a sense of disappointment. 
If he had been alive, perhaps the series of incidents would have simply been a chain of coincidences… Or, if not, it would have significantly narrowed the pool of suspects. 
“Wait a minute.” 
“Trolls.” 
“Yes?”
“What are the names of the three trolls you’re using as summonable beasts?”
I asked, just in case. However, this line of questioning also proved fruitless. The tall one was “Pip,” the middle one was “Poppy,” and the shortest one was “Yepy”? 
As a sane person, I couldn’t comprehend this naming sense. “Regardless, this confirms that someone else deliberately caused these incidents.” 
A coincidence? It was impossible to completely rule out that possibility, but I didn’t believe in coincidences, at least not if Hans wasn’t involved.  Furthermore, the ground collapse phenomenon in Icerock was not a common occurrence, especially not during a expedition. And…
“I have a hunch.”
I cautiously tucked the ring, which I had briefly put on and then taken off again, into my pocket. 
“I think the cleanup is almost finished.”
“Yes.” 
“What are the losses?”
“It’s not exactly good news, but the bulk of the loss was food.”
Right, I see. Other expedition supplies were also vital for survival, but they were less important than food. 
“…What are we going to do now?”
“What else? We resume the journey.”
After confirming the extent of the damage, I had the expedition set off again.  After all, time was of the essence.  Sitting here wouldn’t magically reveal the culprit. I needed to keep thinking as we went along. 
“How far can the Ice Trolls be sent?”
“……Anywhere within my sight!”
Was he worried I was going to hold him accountable for this incident?  The Summoner’s immediate response, while keeping his eyes on me, was unnerving.  
‘…Is he acting?’
Actually, he was the most suspicious, but it wasn’t the right time to press him further. 
“We will divide the remaining three sleds into front, center, and rear formations.”
I decided to change our formation to keep the sleds separated as a precaution. 
And…
Thump, thump.
I continued our march into the depths of the translucent ice cave, lost in thought. If there was truly a culprit among us who had sabotaged our supplies, who could it possibly be? There were too many suspects.  But, I should start by considering those who would suffer the most significant losses if there were a traitor. 
For instance, the team leaders…
“…Shwietz, I apologize. This is my fault. I should have separated the sleds long ago.”
First, Titaana Akuraba. There was no need to mention her suspicious behavior. She was responsible for managing supplies, and she was always the closest to them whenever such incidents occurred.  
“Lady Akuraba, while I’m sure you didn’t do this on purpose, it’s already happened twice.  Whether you like it or not, we need to punish you. Otherwise, everyone will underestimate you.”
The same went for Kaislan. His kind advice and self-sacrificing spirit were all very nice, but that made him even more suspicious.  After all, this guy was the one with the most ambition for the leader position.
“I believe it was an unavoidable accident. However… this time, perhaps holding someone accountable is a necessary measure.”
James Kala. He was the least suspicious among them, but there was no lack of motive if we looked for one. After all, he was the least important member of the team. It would have been easy for someone with enough power to manipulate him from behind the scenes.
“…Your wish is my command. It is the duty and right of the leader.”
Finally, the knight, Jun.  His constant, almost obsessive, kindness towards me was starting to make me feel uneasy.
“Shwietz-ssi, the members are exhausted.”
Our march had continued for two hours longer than our usual schedule.
“Camp!”
We set up camp and held a meeting with the team leaders.  The first agenda item was this:
“We’ve lost potions, thermal gear, and other supplies, but the lack of tents and sleeping bags is the biggest problem.”
“They’re already hungry and now they can’t sleep properly?  They’re bound to be furious.”
“We need to find a solution that doesn’t compromise fairness. If some have a comfortable place to sleep while others have to sleep outside without sleeping bags, resentment will only grow.”
There weren’t enough tents and sleeping bags for all thirty members. My solution was simple:
“What do you suggest we do about this?”
“We can increase the number of night guards.”
“…Night guards?”
There aren’t enough sleeping bags either, so we just need to increase the number of guards. The more people on night watch, the more who can sleep inside. 
“…That’s a bit drastic.”
“It will cause further fatigue.”
“What about taking turns using the tents and sleeping bags?”
The team leaders expressed their concerns, but I dismissed them, exercising my authority as the leader. 
“Shwietz, that method will only fuel resentment towards you.”
I understood their concerns. This wasn’t a solution to the problem, it was merely a way to avoid it.  They’ll probably start saying that this barbarian, who knows nothing about strategy, is forcing them to do ridiculous things. They’ll say I’m unfit to be a leader. 
But…
“That’s fine. Tell everyone that we’re increasing the number of night guards. Each team needs to choose a guard and set up a rotation.”
Increasing the number of night guards was unavoidable. If more people are awake at night, it naturally improves security, and I needed to be on guard for traitors within the expedition.
Therefore…
“Ravien.”
I stopped the Dragonborn woman who was heading towards her tent, looking tired. 
“What is it?”
I was a little suspicious of her too.  I was curious about her relationship with the Marquis.
“I’d like to talk for a bit.”
“Is this about what happened earlier today?”
“Yes. What are your thoughts?”
“The way you’re asking makes me think you believe someone did it on purpose.”
“You must always consider every possibility.”
We had been traveling as a team for a long time, so the atmosphere was more relaxed than before, but our conversation didn’t yield any significant results.
“Even if you say that, I have no idea. I’m not good with that sort of thing.”
“Is that so…”
“Is that all?”
“Yes, you must be tired. Go get some rest.”
I wanted to continue the conversation, but I didn’t think it was going anywhere, so I let Ravien go.
And…
“…”
I headed towards the back of the tent where no one could see me and put the ring I had retrieved from my pocket onto my finger.
“The character is wearing the No. 6111 Fate Tracker.”
As it had been for the past few days, as soon as I put on the ring, it began to glow. 
“The ring has sensed the character’s fate.”
A clear, crimson light.  I quickly took the ring off, worried someone might see.
‘Damn it.’
It had been like this ever since we entered the 7th layer. 
***
Some Numbered items cannot be used in the city.  The No. 399 Silent Cage is one example, and so is the Fate Tracker.  Therefore, as soon as we entered the Labyrinth, I put on the ring.
And…
‘It wasn’t red back then.’
It was the same when we encountered other expedition members on the 6th layer. It remained unchanged during our voyage as well. 
However, the moment we arrived in Icerock…
Swoosh—!
The ring emitted a red light.  It meant that there was a negative event, without any positive elements, nearby.
I hadn’t considered a traitor back then.  
But…
‘If the time we were betrayed was set after we reached the 7th layer, it makes sense that it didn’t light up until now.’
Unlikely misfortunes had plagued our journey, yet the ring’s light persisted.  It meant that everything wasn’t over yet and that a more negative event awaited me within my vicinity.  
“Uncle, when are you going to wake up!”
I opened my eyes and saw Elwen.  I had cut down on the supply of warming stones since there was a shortage, and her body had been shivering all night because her temperature was dropping. 
“Where are the Old Man and Ashid?”
“They’re already up and getting ready.”
“Why didn’t you wake me up earlier?”
“You looked tired, Uncle.”
Well, it was nice of her, but as a warrior, it was a bit embarrassing to be worried about by a mage and a Psyker.
“Should I shave you?”
Elwen asked with a bright smile as I sat up.  I unconsciously touched my chin, feeling the thick stubble.  Of course, I didn’t think it was a problem.
“No need. It’s not uncomfortable.”
Actually, a beard was quite useful in this environment.  At least it was still fur, so it provided a little warmth.
“Hing, you look much better without a beard…”
I ignored Elwen’s complaints and headed outside. The cold air enveloped my skin and filled my lungs. 
Well, the biggest problem was hunger. 
Rrrrrooooww! 
The pangs of hunger came back as soon as I woke up.
“You’re awake.”
“Let’s take down the tents and load them onto the sleds.”
Outside, the Old Man, Didi, and Ashid waited for me. Together, we dismantled the tents we had spent the night in and loaded them onto the sleds.
And…
Creak, creak.
I ate the jerky I had been given for breakfast, trying to save as much as possible.  Afterward, we resumed our journey.
Ten days into our entry into Icerock.  The route ahead was straightforward: Explore the ice cave in the shape of a maze, which stretches under the massive mountain range in the center of the continent, and eventually, you’ll find the massive sinkhole known as the Glacier’s Eye, which is the start of the latter half of the route.
The endpoint of the “Glacier’s Eye.” To put it simply, there was a portal at the bottom of the cave leading to the 8th layer.  
“Essence… essence!”
A commotion came from behind us. 
“Meruan, are you sure you saw Meruan’s essence?”
“What? Wait, that means it’s a 3rd-grade essence?!”
To be precise, it wasn’t just any 3rd-grade essence. It was a rare essence that could only be obtained here in Icerock.
“Everyone, move back!”
I pushed everyone back, then had the mage collect the essence in a vial.  The test results confirmed that it was indeed Meruan’s essence. 
Was it good news after yesterday’s bad news?  
Everyone’s eyes gleamed, even though they were top explorers.  A 3rd-grade essence was a coveted item, and its price was much higher.
“Everyone, calm down. If anyone wants to purchase this essence, they will be granted first dibs after deducting the cost of the vial based on the average price. If there are multiple bidders, we will auction it off!”
Kaislan quickly stepped in to control the expedition’s internal discipline before things escalated.
“…”
Some explorers looked disappointed, but most of them were genuinely happy.  Although a few essences had been found during the expedition, they were all lower-grade.  3rd-grade essences were a different league altogether.
Of course, dividing the price among thirty people wouldn’t leave much for each individual. Still, a profit is a profit. 
“…They said they would distribute the spoils from the Noirch loot fairly later.”
“Plus, the royal family will give rewards based on merit, and that’s not something to be underestimated.”
“Anyone who wants that essence will have to earn a lot of merit. Otherwise, they won’t have the money.”
“All this aside, we’ll be well compensated for our hard work.”
“That’s if the expedition succeeds, though.”
Despite the bad news from yesterday, the mood within the expedition was quite bright thanks to this positive development.  Of course, they’d probably talk about me behind my back, but if it helped to keep morale high, there was no reason for me, as the leader, to be unhappy.
‘People always need a bad guy, right?’
Three more days passed.  Thankfully, we didn’t lose more supplies or have any members die in battle.
But…
“The ring has sensed the character’s fate.”
The ring still glowed red.  That’s why I continued investigating the traitor, interrogating the Summoner and constantly checking the expedition members’ information, like I was being chased.
And finally…
“It’s the Glacier’s Eye!”
Thirteen days into our entry into Icerock.  We were on the verge of the 7th layer’s latter half. 
“What’s going on?  It’s too early for a camp setup… ”
I ordered the establishment of a campsite and then summoned all of the leaders.  It was for a simple reason:  We still had a few hours before nightfall, but…
“There’s a traitor among us.”
I think I know who it is.
