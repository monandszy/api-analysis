## The Abandoned City (4)
The nameless Rose Knight, a woman I didn’t even know the name of, vanished before my eyes like a ghost as soon as I finished my question. Needless to say, I didn’t get an answer this time either. 
But…
Thump-thump. 
A warrior’s heart instinctively senses danger, beating rapidly. Was this speculation true? Or was I wrong? I couldn’t tell at this point. However, the King’s plan to completely obliterate Bifron held a huge question mark.
“Noark.”
Did Noark know about this plan? Seeing that they hadn’t deployed any significant forces on the wall connecting to Bifron, they must have known something… But…
“What are they both aiming for?”
My head felt like it would burst. Still, I continued my thoughts without stopping. Time passed, I didn’t know how much. 
“Haah…,” I sighed.
I wondered if a brilliant idea would suddenly pop into my head if I just kept at it.
Swoosh-swoosh-swoosh-!
I turned my back to the howling night wind and descended the wall. Unfortunately, I didn’t have much time left. The Rose Knight had told me that I only had so much time remaining.
“Twelve hours…,” I muttered, disbelief clinging to my voice.
The city block would explode after dawn, when noon passed. Of course, the explosion was just my speculation, but…
Thump.
Time was tight, so I jumped down from the wall at a suitable height.
Kaboom-!
The landing made a rather loud noise, but…
“Well, everyone has to wake up anyway,” I shrugged off the sound.
The landlord told me to move out, what could I do? I had to leave as soon as possible. I’d pack up everything I needed. 
***
No matter how much I thought about it, I knew something was hidden in Bifron, but…
“Let’s just give up.”
I had been investigating for days, but there were no leads. If I had managed to discover something within those walls, things would be different, but as it stood, I had no choice. I had to leave Bifron as instructed by the King.
However, there was one more problem.
“That’s a strange question. They’re not allowed to enter the residential areas,” the Rose Knight stated.
Only those from the 7th district were allowed to evacuate; the residents of Bifron couldn’t be taken along. In other words, this city, already abandoned once, was about to be abandoned by us again…
“This problem is easy.”
Finding a solution was not difficult at all. Therefore…
“B-Boss? What brings you here at this hour…,” a voice stammered.
After descending the wall, I immediately went to the house of the person they called “Whiny”.
“Gather all the residents of Bifron right now. Not a single person left behind,” I commanded.
“Yes…?,” he asked, confused.
“We have no time, so I’ll explain everything later, once everyone’s gathered. Do it now. Tell them to leave behind anything that’s not absolutely necessary.”
He might not understand my words, but I hope he understood that I meant it.
“…Are we leaving?”
“Yes.”
“I’ll gather them right away! H-How much time do we have?”
“Before 9 am. The sooner, the better. I’ll take care of our people, you gather the Bifron residents.”
“Yes!”
The sleepy Whiny, who was still half-awake, got up and immediately put on his coat, then rushed out, having grasped the urgency. And…
“The Rose Knight came to you?”
“Yes. They said they would open the checkpoint at the 4th district around noon, so we should get out quickly.”
“Anything else besides that?”
“Ah, they also said they couldn’t take the residents of Bifron.”
“…………You wouldn’t have just agreed to that, would you?”
“No, I just agreed.”
“…………?”
“Don’t worry. I have a way.”
I shared the conversation with my companions, then asked them to gather the explorers from the 7th district. Time passed, I didn’t know how much.
I waited at the Dimensional Plaza, the designated meeting point. Explorers who had heard the news and Bifron residents began to gather one by one.
“I, I came here because it’s urgent…,” one whispered.
“Does anyone know what’s going on?”
“Feljain said we should leave immediately…,” another added.
The plaza became chaotic, as people began to gather without a proper explanation. However, instead of calmly explaining the situation and calming them down, I continued with the preparations we had to finish before noon. It’s better to try and solve the problem than to waste time worrying and empathizing, right?
“Paper! Get all the clean paper!”
“Anyone who can write, gather here!”
I couldn’t do it all alone, so I gathered anyone I could find and put them to work. Of course, Ainar was an exception, given that she could write…
“Ainar! You’ve been learning to write for three years now, haven’t you?”
“…H-Haha! Misha! There’s no end to learning!”
Ainar still only knows how to read. To be honest, I can’t understand why she can read but not write. 
Anyway…
One hour, two hours, three hours…
Time, which felt incredibly short, flew by, and as dawn gradually broke, all the people in the city had gathered at the plaza. Therefore…
“Everyone gather here! The Baron has something to say!”
It was time to explain the current situation to everyone. I could have told them earlier, but…
Why repeat the same thing twice?
“Ahem.”
I didn’t need a separate platform; I used [Giant Growth] to enlarge my body and looked down at the crowd of over a thousand people.
“I won’t waste your time. The King contacted me last night.”
I started with the essence to increase their focus.
“Oooh!”
“The King contacted us!”
“Can we leave now?”
As expected, the crowd reacted strongly. It’s strange, really. I’ve given so many speeches that it’s easy to manipulate them to react the way I want.
“…Does everyone else do this?”
I don’t know, but right now, I had to focus on my speech.
“Yes! The King said they would open the checkpoint at the 4th district and help us escape the city!”
I’d delivered the main points…
“Ooooooh!”
“W-We’re saved—!”
“But!”
It was time for a twist. You always have to hear bad news first so that the good news sounds better.
“Damn it, the King said we can’t all go together.”
My words, spoken over the crowd’s cheers, instantly silenced the plaza.
“…………?”
Thousands of faces, filled with confusion and bewilderment. 
One of Bifron’s residents, meeting my gaze, asked, “We can’t all go together…? W-What does that mean?”
“Just like that. The King said they would only take the residents of the 7th district.”
“T-Then, that means… we’re excluded!”
“Yes. They said they couldn’t take the residents of Bifron.”
Name tags weren’t necessary at this moment. Just by looking at the faces crowded in the plaza, I could tell who was a resident of Bifron and who was from the 7th district.
“………!!!”
Bifron’s residents’ eyes widened at my answer, which sounded like a death sentence.
“……….”
The explorers from the 7th district couldn’t speak, as if they didn’t know what expression to make. The joy and despair in the crowd were so clear.
And amidst that atmosphere…
“Then! Then why did you call us?!”
Someone in the crowd shouted, filled with anger.
“If you were going to abandon us anyway! Why did you call us!”
They were no longer polite.
I can’t blame them.
It’s only natural for people who have been pushed to the brink to react like that.
So…
“Well, I plan on taking you guys too.”
I smirked, as if it was all a joke. The man who had been yelling in anger blinked, dumbfounded.
“…………Yes?”
“Did you go deaf?”
“N-No… it’s just… The King said they wouldn’t, well, take us…”
Ah, I get it.
From their perspective, it makes no sense.
To defy the King in this strange city is an unthinkable act.
Bifron’s residents have experienced firsthand, for their entire lives, what happens when they oppose the King.
“Yes. And I said I would take you guys with me.”
“…B-But! Aren’t you a Baron?”
“Baron? That’s true. But what are you trying to say?”
The man looked up at me at my question.
And…
“Why…,” he stammered, his eyes trembling.
“Why are you doing all this for us?”
Ironically…
That was a question I’d been asking myself.
After all, what I’m doing is going against the King’s wishes…
This decision could also make it difficult for me to gain a foothold in aristocratic society in the future.
But why did I make this decision?
Why was it so easy for me to make up my mind?
If you think about it, the reason is simple.
“Because I just want to.”
“Yes…?,” he asked again.
“Why can’t I?”
“N-No, that’s not what I meant…”
“Anyway, that’s all for now. Everyone fill out the paperwork as instructed; we need to be ready to leave on time! That’s all!”
I finished my announcement, and then the residents began to sign the paperwork, guided by my companions.
And as that came to an end…
“That was close.”
The checkpoint gates opened as promised.
***
Creak-creak-!
The checkpoint gates, which had been closed for a long time, creaked open slowly.
Gulp-!
The crowd gathered in front of the checkpoint swallowed nervously, focusing their attention.
And in that situation…
Click-click.
The knights of the King’s household, carrying the emblem of the King on their chests, walked out, making a metallic clang. They formed a line at the entrance to the checkpoint, creating a passage.
As if waiting for someone to come out.
“It’s, it’s opening…,” someone murmured.
As if echoing that murmur, a woman emerged from the checkpoint, walking between the knights.
Thump-thump.
The woman wore the same uniform as the knights in front of her. However, it was obvious at a glance that it was a disguise. 
Because it was the Rose Knight I had seen yesterday.
“The number of people…,” she murmured, slowly looking around the crowd.
Finally, her gaze stopped on me. 
“More than expected?”
Her eyes held the meaning, “What kind of trick is this?”
But I had no reason to feel intimidated.
I hadn’t done anything illegal.
“What’s wrong with so many people? Is there a problem?”
The woman shook her head calmly at my teasing question.
“No.”
“……….”
“After all, those who are not permitted will not cross this gate.”
The woman’s composure, despite this unexpected situation, was chilling.
I guess those women are not to be underestimated. 
Although, to be fair, her last words were exactly what I led her to say.
“Then that’s good. Since those who are not permitted will not cross this gate.”
I smirked and asked, and this time, she frowned, as if completely taken aback.
“What does that mean, Baron?”
I showed her one of the prepared documents instead of answering. She trailed off.
“This is…,” she whispered.
Heh, she didn’t expect this—
“What is this?”
She didn’t seem to understand what this document meant yet.
It’s true that I wouldn’t have thought of this solution if I hadn’t been asking around and hearing all kinds of stories about what was hidden in Bifron.
Besides being allowed to leave when they turn fourteen, there was only one other way for Bifron’s residents to obtain an entry permit.
Smirking, I explained what this document meant to her, without hiding the triumphant grin on my face.
“It’s an employment contract.”
“Employment contract…?”
“Simply put, from now on, they’re our 얀델 family’s retainers.”
Oh, just so you know, they don’t get paid.
