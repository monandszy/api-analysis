## Chapter 464: Proof (4)
The reward for defeating Riakis, the Church of Riakis's achievement, was simple.
After the raid, I went to the hut and entered the flames. My mental resistance stat increased significantly, and my character was moved to the Witch's Forest.
Then...
"Achievement Unlocked"
Condition: Defeat the Chaos Lord Riakis.
Reward: Permanently increases your Mental Resistance stat by +50.
When I reopened the achievement window, '???' had changed. It was a truly unique hidden piece in [Dungeon & Stone].
It was an achievement reward, but I had to go to a designated place, and it was a time-limited reward that couldn't be claimed later.
Most importantly...
"Permanently increases your Mental Resistance stat by +50."
The message ending in a single line, without any embellishment, was strange.
There was no mention of an unknown power imbuing my body. No mention of a hidden being bestowing a blessing. 
None of the messages that usually appear when discovering a hidden piece existed. I conducted several experiments, wondering if I had missed something, but the results were the same.
So I thought there was nothing hidden...
"Error Occurred."
Where in the world is this place? This clearly isn't the Witch's Forest.
"Unable to locate the character's position."
"Character log transmission temporarily suspended."
Who is this girl, anyway?
Thud, thud, thud.
A field bathed in the dim light of a burning bonfire. I watched the girl, who didn't answer my first question, "Who are you?", as I scanned my surroundings.
Just then, the girl broke the silence.
[...Alice Graundia.]
A voice resonating not in my ears, but in my mind. The voice itself was surprisingly ordinary.
However...
"...What the hell?"
Chills ran down my spine as the words spilled out of my mouth uncontrollably. 
She was that famous.
"Ah, sorry for the curse word. I'm a barbarian.  I sometimes say things like this when I'm startled."
I took a deep breath and examined the girl. Her expression wasn't playful. But, that didn't mean I could easily accept it.
'Is she really the Earth Witch?'
I couldn't believe it.
But I decided to accept it coolly. After all, there was no reason not to believe it. Didn't I already know that the Witch was alive?
And there was no way a girl I met in this place was an ordinary girl. 
Yes, so...
'This is even better.'
If she was truly the Witch, this was an opportunity to extract information through a long conversation—
[You must not open the Gate of Abyss.]
Huh?
What does that mean?
Just as I was about to respond, filled with questions, I felt it.
Whoosh!
A strangely eerie wind blew, and the space around us twisted like the clearing of fog. 
I reached out urgently towards the fading Witch.
But the only thing that met my fingertips was—
"...Yande, what are you doing?"
Amelia's angry face.
***
"The character's location has been confirmed."
"Resuming character log transmission."
***
The Witch's Forest I had returned to, as if by magic. 
Overtaken by a sense of being possessed by a ghost, I momentarily checked if my companions had experienced a similar phenomenon.
"...A field shrouded in fog? What are you talking about?"
"We just came out and ended up here!"
So, you guys didn't experience that...
"I guess I must have seen something."
I wasn't sure what had happened, so I simply brushed it off. Amelia looked suspicious and glanced at me, but she didn't ask any further questions.
[23:50]
We decided to end our exploration here, checking the time. We spent our time resting freely.
"Hey, Biyo—!"
"Pnelin, leave him alone. He seems to be thinking about something."
"Ah. Okay..."
Although it was only a few minutes, Amelia's presence allowed me to clear my thoughts. 
First, what I just experienced wasn't a dream. 
The girl I met was indeed the Earth Witch.
There was no room for doubt.
But...
'Don't open the Gate of Abyss.'
What does that mean? Why did I experience that alone? 
I felt like everyone had some strange expectations of me, including Auril Gaviss.
'...Is it simply because I'm the Original Clearer?'
Sigh, I think and think every day, but why does there seem to be more to think about?
"The Labyrinth has been closed."
In the end, I didn't find the answer to my questions until the Labyrinth closed.
"The character is being moved to Raphdonia."
The blurry sky of the city as always.
"Wait, is that...?”
"It's Baron Yande..."
Explorers who recognized me whispered among themselves as we returned to the Dimensional Square. It had become a common occurrence, so I didn't pay much attention and scanned my surroundings.
"...It was really dangerous this time."
"Thankfully, none of us died and we're all back. Let's go home and rest."
The explorers who had fought a war on the 7th floor seemed particularly exhausted. Their equipment was in terrible condition.
'Did something happen?'
I'll have to check that later. 
I can now get this kind of information offline, directly from Versil, so there's no need to go to the Round Table anymore.
The need for the Round Table is gradually decreasing as our influence grows.
'But, I have the clown and the GM's aide, so I have to keep participating.'
I slowly started walking toward the checkpoint.  If it had been in the past, I would have rushed to get in line as quickly as possible, but I wasn't in a hurry anymore.
"Bjorn! Here! Here!"
The integrated checkpoint, only available to teams of 4th rank or higher. However, at this rank, most teams were already clans, so there was almost no line.  Teams with 10 people or more had to use a different checkpoint.
'I should raise the clan rank soon. I don't want to waste time at the checkpoint later.'
The line was short, and the income from the stones was negligible, so it didn't take long to leave the checkpoint.
Therefore...
"Ainar, are you going straight to the inn?"
"Of course. See you later!"
After parting ways with Ainar, I went straight home.
'By the way, I have to take care of this house this month...'
Even though I came home, a space for rest, homework came to mind first.
I just got back after capturing Riakis.
"I'm going to go wash up first. Everyone else, do whatever you want and rest."
"You've worked hard."
"Rest, Yande."
I went to the bathroom and washed away the dirt I had accumulated while exploring. After cleaning myself up, I immediately collapsed onto the bed.
"Sigh..."
Let's get some sleep.
I have to get up early tomorrow.
***
The next day, 6 am.
I washed quietly, careful not to wake up Amelia and Erwen, who were still asleep, and went out into the street.
"Yawn."
I'm sleepy as hell.
'I went to bed around 2 pm, so I slept for about 15 hours...'
I was able to hold on a bit longer because it was a 15-day exploration that ended on the 3rd floor, but my body was still tired.
Sigh, the usual rule after an exploration is to simply relax at home. But...
"It is an honor to escort you, Baron Yande."
As I reached the shared shuttle stop, I boarded a noble's carriage and headed towards the Imperial City of Carnon.
It had been a while since I rode a carriage to the Imperial City. The Baron paid for it when I met the Baron, and the royal family paid for it when I participated in the coronation ceremony.
'I should just sleep while I'm on the way.'
Feeling relieved that I saved 700,000 stones with a little inconvenience, I began to doze off.
[13:10]
The carriage arrived at my destination a little after noon.
Crunch, crunch.
I soothed my hungry stomach with jerky and headed towards the mansion's gate, where a guard with rabbit ears approached me.  There was no plot where he couldn't recognize my face.
"I greet Baron Yande."
The guard greeted me, welcoming me to the Baron's house, and let me in.
I was surprised by the extreme hospitality.
'...This is the dignity of a noble house.'
It's like every little detail is imbued with invisible effort. Even if I buy land and build a building and call it Baron Yande's House in the future, it'll take a long time to emulate this level of detail.
"Baron Yande, it's been a while."
As I waited in the room where I was led by the guard, the Rabbit Baron, whom I had met during the coronation ceremony, entered.
"It's been a while, Baron Lirivia. You have a nice home. The people are also friendly."
"Hee hee, thank you for your kind words. But you don't seem nervous at all, do you?"
"Am I supposed to be?"
"No, of course not. I meant it as a compliment. And honestly, I can't even imagine Baron Yande being nervous."
"I do get nervous. In life-or-death situations."
"When you say it like that, I am reminded that you're truly an explorer."
The Rabbit Baron, who has been rolling around in high society for a long time, was a great talker. I just had to answer, and he effortlessly kept the conversation going, as if he knew what I was thinking.
"Oh, it's already time. I have something to do as the host of this meeting, so I'll be going. I have to greet the others from the other houses."
"Where should I go later?"
I asked about the location, and the Rabbit Baron tilted his head slightly and chuckled.
"Baron Yande doesn't need to worry about that. Someone will come and guide you when the time comes. Rest comfortably until then."
"...Alright. See you later."
The guide that the Rabbit Baron mentioned arrived about 30 minutes later.
"The heads of the houses are waiting for you."
The place I arrived at was a large space that looked like a study. I couldn't help but think of the Round Table.
It was unavoidable.
There was indeed a large round table placed there.
'Does this world hold meetings without a round table?'
I wanted to laugh at the sudden thought, but I controlled myself. I couldn't make a bad first impression.
"..."
Without needing to glance around, I could see that everyone in the room was looking at me. They all seemed curious about the new recruit...
'If they were going to do this, they should have dropped by the coronation ceremony for a quick greeting.'
Ah, they said they couldn't come because it would draw attention back then. Hearing what the Rabbit Baron told me earlier and seeing everyone here, I realized that this was truly a group of herbivores.
"Excuse me, Baron Yande. Can you please stand there for a while? It won't take long."
"Alright."
"Well, now that everyone is here, let's start with the first agenda."
The Rabbit Baron, seated at the head of the table, took on the role of moderator and began the meeting.
"The first agenda for today's meeting is Baron Yande's admission. In accordance with the principle of equality pursued by this council, anyone is free to voice their opinions before the vote, and after the agenda is passed by a majority vote, the results must be accepted humbly."
Right, this is roughly the atmosphere.
I see why they're using a round table where everyone can face each other.
"I have something I'd like to ask Baron Yande."
Just as the meeting began, a fairy man with a mustache raised his hand.  His blue hair meant I knew which house he was from.
"Go ahead."
"First, let me introduce myself. I am Baron Heskaira. It is truly an honor to meet such a famous hero in this setting."
"Nice to meet you. I'm Baron Yande. What did you want to ask?"
"I heard you recently became the chief of the barbarians. Is that true?"
"It is."
It wasn't a story I could hide, so I simply nodded.
Everyone seemed to know, so the heads of the houses didn't react much.
They all knew.
They knew the important part was what came next.
"I've heard about Baron Yande, so I'll cut to the chase. Why did you do it? Did you not know the unwritten rules of this place?"
"Of course I knew them."
"Oh..."
Seeing me coolly admit to it, the heads of the houses gleamed with interest.
"You knew, but why did you do such a thing...?"
"Because it was an unwritten rule that didn't benefit me."
"..."
"I can't take that lightly."
"Why?"
"We've been trying our best to avoid antagonizing the existing noble houses. But Baron Yande has undone all that hard work."
"I know. We've been showing everyone that we're as far removed from the sacred grounds as possible and that we're loyal to the royal family."
"Baron Yande, you knew that, yet—"
It was time to make a first impression on these people.
"But so what?"
I cut off the mustache man. This action of mine might have seemed rude to those who were born and raised in noble houses, but...
"What's changed so far?"
After all, I'm a barbarian.
"..."
The fairy man was speechless after I asked what had changed, and I looked around. 
This was the perfect time to imprint my character.
"Honestly, you all know, don't you? No matter how much we distance ourselves from the sacred grounds, they won't accept us."
They didn't even draw a proper line. It's like covering your eyes and pretending nothing is happening.
They may not be sitting on the chief's throne, but every house here has some kind of connection with the sacred grounds.
'They're hanging onto me because they can get the barbarians' support if I'm there.'
Hey, if you're going to bow, bow low, and if you're going to rise, rise with a surprise attack. This is the game, isn't it?
How come these politicians don't know this better than me?
"Well, are you done with your questions?"
"Yes.  At least, we know what kind of person Baron Yande is."
Good. That's exactly what I wanted.
As the mustache man finished his turn, the Rabbit Baron continued to lead the meeting.
"Does anyone have any more questions for Baron Yande, or other opinions?"
"..."
"If not, I will now begin the voting. Those in favor of Baron Yande's admission, please raise your hands."
The vote began, and it was completely different from what I had expected.
I figured they weren't doing a secret vote, but I didn't expect it to be a simple show of hands.
"..."
The heads of the houses began to raise their hands one after another in the silence, oblivious to the outdated method.
Thankfully, the outcome was as I expected.
"Thirty-one houses voted in favor, and therefore, Baron Yande's admission is passed."
Unanimous.
"As of today, the enemies of Baron Yande's House are our enemies, and we will never betray Baron Yande's House under any circumstances."
As the Rabbit Baron finished his statement, the heads of the houses clapped politely, but I wasn't really happy. 
After all, this was a noble house of a different species appearing for the first time in 600 years.
And on top of that, it was the first barbarian house!
Even if I had stripped down and pooped right there, the outcome would have been the same.
They're used to waiting. They finally allowed my admission, hoping my son doesn't have mental deficiencies.
"Baron Yande, you can take your seat now."
I sat down in the only remaining empty seat, and the applause stopped. The Rabbit Baron gave me a few words of advice, and the meeting continued.
"The second agenda is the support for Baron Yande's House."
This one was practically decided already. Supporting Baron Yande's House in Melves was already a done deal.
However, the discussion went on about how much money they would spend to buy what land, and how much support they would provide afterwards.
And...
'I definitely got the maximum support here...'
Thanks to the Rabbit Baron's efforts in representing me, the amount of support was a bit more generous than I expected.
Therefore, the next agenda.
"The third agenda is..."
The Rabbit Baron looked at me nervously, then continued.
"The official support for Baron Yande and Clan Anabada."
"...Clan Anabada? You mean the clan under Baron Yande?"
"Yes, that's right."
As expected, the heads of the houses stirred as soon as he finished speaking.
"We accepted Baron Yande's establishment because it's for our benefit, but this is a whole different matter."
"Support for an individual, not a house! This is unprecedented!"
Questions were flying from everywhere, and they all boiled down to one.
"Why should we do that?"
Is there a justification for such an action?
"That's—"
I stood up, cutting off the Rabbit Baron's response.
'Hell, I can't leave this to others.'
Ultimately, you prove your own worth.
