## Raid (5)
The Layer Lord.
A kind of field boss that appeared when specific summoning conditions were met on each layer of the labyrinth. 
Typically, it was a challenge only attempted by those with the specs to reliably clear the 7th layer, making it an upper-level raid for those who had progressed to higher layers. 
At least, that was the case until the 5th layer lord.
From the 6th layer lord onwards, where the difficulty skyrocketed, Layer Lords were classified as “apex raids.”  It wasn't an exaggeration to consider them end-game content from there. 
‘But a Layer Lord as the first raid, really?’ 
Considering the 4th layer’s "Doppelganger Forest" had been the highest-level raid in terms of clearing standards, it was absurd.  
Especially with only four fighters currently engaged in battle. 
Not even a full party, let alone a raid group.
But…
‘I've got a few Rank 3 essences, I should be able to land the finishing blow, right?’
The moment I spotted Riakis from afar, I had made my judgment. 
It wasn't just a matter of trying to be greedy, it was foolish not to take the chance.  Moreover…
‘There was a promise I made back then.’
It was a promise to myself, as cheesy as it sounded. 
If I ever saw it again—
[Gr-oo-ooo-ooo—!!!!!]
It would be different this time. 
“Yandel, what should we do next?”
“Hey, I'll hold it off, you guys just keep hitting it hard.”
“Is… that all?”
Amelia stared at me like I was crazy after hearing the concise order, but there was no other way. 
Riakis’s 4th phase was always like this. 
There was no clever trick, no cunning strategy. 
Simply, we just had to force it down. 
「The Chaos Lord Riakis senses a source of life.」
The moment I entered its range, the beast stopped its frenzied pacing and turned towards us. 
Then…
[Gr-oo-ooo-ooo—!]
It let out a ferocious howl and charged at us. 
Even the sound of its footsteps was different compared to the 1st phase.
Thud, thud, thud—!
Still heavy, but much lighter and faster than before.
Of course, its speed was incomparable.
The concept of its 4th phase was “agility.”
“Everyone, fall back.”
I sent my comrades back and linked [Transcendence] and [Gigantification].
「Your physique grows in proportion to your Strength stat.」
It wouldn't have worked during the 1st phase when I boasted a massive physique, but now, with my skin practically clinging to bone, the size was about right. 
One of the many advantages of [Gigantification]. 
「The Chaos Lord Riakis feels greatly threatened by the character.」
My “Threat” stat increased significantly, ensuring that I would pull aggro during the raid. 
This was something Riakis had never encountered before.
Prey at its eye level.
“Behel—laaaaaaa—aaaaaa—aaaaaaa!!”
I activated [Primal Surge] to further boost my already high Threat stat and charged forward.
Giant Shield Charge, as I called it. 
Kaboom—!
The giant barbarian with a shield and the giant monster collided at the midway point, creating a deafening roar.
Screech.
Sadly, it was I who lost in the Strength stat.
No surprise there.
These Lord bastards never had any conscience when it came to base stats.
Wham—!
I activated [Swing] and struck it with my hammer, but the beast didn't budge—literally. 
A jaw strike should have caused some kind of stun. 
It instantly retaliated by swinging its front leg.
[Kee-ya-aaaack!]
Its attack speed was terrifying in the 4th phase, and I had no way to dodge.
Well, there was no reason to dodge.
Wham—!
This side was just as tough, you see.
As my hammer strike didn't hurt it, neither did its blow hurt me—.
‘…But why does everything keep spinning?’
I re-evaluated my judgment the moment I finished checking my damage output.
My resistance stats weren't low enough for my head to be ripped off or my body to be shredded by its claws. 
But…
‘…My head won't hold up.’
My body swayed as the impact reached my brain. 
I don't think I felt this much even when my middle school PE teacher slapped me with all his might…
“Bjorn!!”
I quickly tossed aside the memories of my childhood that flashed like a montage and focused on the present.
Whoosh—!
The beast was swinging its front leg again.
Kaboom—!
Luckily, I managed to block it with my shield in time.
Also, the damage dealers had just finished setting up their formation.
「Amelia Rainwells activated [Self-Replication].」
Amelia charged in from both sides with her clones.
Swoosh.
She didn't seem to mind wasting resources, she had activated [Abyssal Power] from the start and focused on targeting Riakis’s lower body, its ankles, thighs, and so on.
And at the same time.
「Einar Frnellin activated [Repeated Slash].」
Einar jumped high and brought his greatsword down on the beast’s shoulder.
The usual explosion was absent.
Because this wasn't a mob farm.
「Einar Frnellin activated [Primal Control].」
[Primal Control].
The essence I had recommended to Einar back when she was agonizing over which Royal reward to choose.
This skill’s effect was simple.
「All the conditional activation effects of your next attack are converted to Cutting Power.」
[Blast Scars], [Slick Oil], [Residual Heat].
The damage output of all three conditional skills is converted to Cutting Power.
Simply put…
Swoosh.
It means she can freely swap between raid mode and hunting mode.
Of course, that didn't mean she landed a critical hit.
She managed to cut through its thick hide, and a few drops of black, oil-like blood flowed out.
[Gr-oo-ooo-ooo—!]
I expected Amelia, the Aura user, to deal decent damage, but Einar was doing better than anticipated.
So now, all that’s left is Erwen…
「Erwen Pornach di Tersia activated [Concentrated Fire].」
「Erwen Pornach di Tersia activated [Elemental Synthesis].」
「Erwen Pornach di Tersia activated [Rupture].」
Needless to say…
“Old Man, dodge!”
I had sparred with Erwen a few times before, so the moment I heard her words, I stepped aside and gave her a clear shot.
And in that instant.
Flash.
A beam of light shot out.
Whiz—!
The sound of something being pierced came next.
Kaboom—!
Beyond the scattering light.
[K-oo-oo-oo-ooo-!!!]
I smirked as I saw the beast writhe in agony.
While Erwen’s attack wasn't a critical hit yet, it was far from being enough.
‘Wow, that took off a chunk of its forehead.’
The damage was enough.
So, in other words…
「The Chaos Lord Riakis activated [Tainted Horn].」
The raid was on. 
***
The Chaos Lord Riakis.
Its 1st phase is simple.
It inflicts continuous damage through [Despair’s Rain], a passive aura, and the chaos elemental’s field contamination. The contaminated ground spawns orbs periodically, restoring Riakis’s health.
The only thing to watch out for is this.
[Vile Rift]
A one-hit kill that it uses after it eats enough orbs.
The countermeasure is easy.
Just run outside the AoE.
The problem is that if you leave the AoE, the designated “prey” will be immobilized.
Riakis will then be aggroed to the “prey,” and if you successfully defeat the “prey,” your base stats will increase, making the next phase harder.
‘Well, at least it’s a simple melee fight aside from that.’
The real raid starts from the 2nd phase. 
Once its health drops below a certain threshold, Riakis feels threatened and opens [The Gate of Chaos], sucking everyone inside.
Permanent contamination of all tiles.
Severe mental contamination.
You have to track down Riakis in this worst-case scenario and fight it with countless battle buffs.
The hardest phase in terms of pure mechanics.
But, it changes if you have “Purification Torch.”
Just keep the torch lit and endure. 
It’s a two-day event in game time, and [The Gate of Chaos] will open again and you’ll return to the original field. 
‘Getting enough torches for everyone is a bit tricky, but it’s still an easier route.’
Of course, there are downsides to this strategy.
If you skip to the 3rd phase by exploiting this, Riakis not only fully recovers its health, but it’s also much stronger.
Well, it’s still more advantageous to use torches, so I used them for the most part.
Anyway.
In the 3rd phase, chaos elementals no longer spawn on the 3rd layer.
Instead, [Despair’s Rain] becomes stronger.
Areas exposed to the rain quickly turn into contaminated areas, rendering all your equipment useless.
Until the labyrinth closes, Numbered items completely lose their effect, and Adamantium armor is reduced to regular iron armor in terms of defense.
‘They probably… started to fall apart here, those Toothed Teeth.’
You can no longer use mental immunity through the torch.
You have to fight against a stronger Riakis in that state.
My guess is that the Toothed Teeth Clan used a rotation strategy here. They probably managed aggro and steadily chipped away at its health.
‘Otherwise, it wouldn’t have started roaming around after 6 hours of the 3rd phase beginning.’
However, I wasn’t really curious about how their raid failed.
Something definitely went wrong.
[Dungeon and Stone] is that kind of game. 
A single mistake, however small, can lead to irreversible consequences.
‘But considering they managed to drag it to the 4th phase, it seems like they prepared quite well…’
Ultimately, it was a good thing for me.
The hardest thing about the 4th phase is that you can't get any gear buffs, but we don't have that penalty, do we?
‘How could I just pass this up.’
It’s almost like it’s being handed to me on a silver platter.
Even if it gives me indigestion later, I have to eat it first.
I don't know if I’ll get an essence or not.
But if it drops, it’ll make things a lot easier for me in the future.
Kaboom—!
The fierce battle had been going on for over 30 minutes.
Erwen’s arrow pierced deep into Riakis’s left eye.
「The Chaos Lord Riakis activated [Tainted Left Eye].」
Okay, so now it’s lost both its eyes?
Whoooosh—!
Ominous black smoke came from its eye socket.
And from within, a terrifying, glowing eye.
[…….]
The beast no longer groaned even when pierced or when its eye exploded.
As if it was becoming less and less like a living being.
‘The time its claws grew back… it was when it had about seven tainted parts, right?’
The concept of the 4th phase is simple.
If you keep hitting it, Riakis regains health by using its tainted parts, becoming slightly stronger each time. 
And…
‘Eleven now.’
Only one more blow left.
The raid ends when 12 out of its 36 possible parts become tainted.
“Everyone, fall back!”
As soon as I sent my teammates back, the beast began its final struggle.
「The power of contamination begins to rampage.」
As a boss, it’s a given that it has an enraged pattern of its own.
Now it's a game of time.
「Blessing for the Pilgrim.」
「The unknown energy hidden within chaos begins to purify the contaminated power.」
It takes about 5 minutes for Riakis to purify its tainted parts and return to its original state.
We must contaminate one more part within that—.
“Old Man!”
Erwen urgently called out to me.
What? There’s nothing urgent that could happen from the back at this point…
“Th, there are over a dozen people headed this way! And they’re coming very fast!”
“What?”
A dozen people? Who the hell is that?
The first possibility that came to mind was that our barbarians from the shelter came here on their own because they were worried about me.
But…
“…It looks like the Toothed Teeth Clan!”
Of course, the world doesn't work that kindly. 
“What?! Didn’t those guys fail?”
Einar exclaimed, unable to hide his surprise. 
I felt the same.
‘What the hell… is going on?’
It makes no sense. 
A dozen people?
If they had that many, why was Riakis wandering around on its own?  Did they maybe not fail their raid after all?
All sorts of questions lingered without being answered. 
But, one thing was for sure.
‘Those bastards are coming here…'
This is a very negative variable for us.
It’s simple, just switch positions.
‘Right when we’re about to land the final blow…’
Those bastards won’t let us land the final blow.
So, that means…
‘…Nothing changes.’
「Purification rate 1%.」
About 10 minutes left until Riakis fully recovers.
Consider that time reduced.
Like a simple and valiant barbarian.
“Behel—laaaaaaa—aaaaaa—aaaaaaa!!”
“Old Man?”
“What are you all doing? Take it down now!!”
We can worry about the rest later.
