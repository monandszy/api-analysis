## The Owner of the Land (2)
The Alminus Count’s family. It wasn’t one of the great houses that had existed since the dawn of the Raphdonia Kingdom.  However, the Alminus Trading Company, which owned the [Alminus Central Exchange] and [Alminus Bank], was a family of influence rivaling the great houses. The Trading Company was a patron of the Tusktooth Clan, a massive clan whose influence stretched even to the Labyrinth.
“I knew they wouldn’t just sit back, but to take it public in Mozzlan… I didn’t expect that.”
Amelia, as if agreeing with my muttered words, chuckled.
“That Count’s family has more guts than I thought. I didn’t expect them to play this card, especially after they were clearly caught trying to conduct an unauthorized subjugation.”
“Emily, it’s not your fault. You don’t need to feel responsible.”
“Responsible? Why should I feel responsible?”
“Well….”
It just felt like the right time to say that… I mean, if not, then so be it. 
I felt a bit awkward, so I quickly changed the subject. 
“More importantly, why didn’t you tell me about this two days ago? The message was dated two days before.”
“I knew you’d be busy, and there were a few things I needed to check beforehand. I was going to come looking for you today if you still hadn’t come home.”
“Check?”
Amelia, as if waiting for this moment, told me about several things she’d checked during the past two days.  It was bad news.
“First of all, rumors have started circulating in the taverns. It seems they’ve already begun their propaganda campaign.”
The Alminus Count’s family had started their public relations offensive. 
“I have a feeling about what they’re saying, but what exactly are they saying?”
“They’re all saying slightly different things, but ultimately, they’re accusing us of stealing the Tiered Monarch we had captured.  And, oh, by the way, some even suggest we might have been the ones to summon him in the first place.”
“That’s what I thought….”
“But there are a lot of people arguing against those rumors.  Fortunately, the path you’ve walked all this time doesn’t seem to have been entirely in vain, does it?”
Yes, thanks to the Fame score I diligently built up. This might be satisfying—
“But we need to hurry.”
“What do you mean?”
“I saw them approaching the explorers who helped you back then. They’re probably trying to persuade them to give favorable testimonies.”
“Persuade? There’s a Verification magic, so they can’t lie.”
“Are you still unaware? In Mozzlan’s trials, you can exercise the right to remain silent. They’ll probably have them skip over any uncomfortable questions and only answer partially, giving a favorable testimony.”
“….well, even so, our side is more credible, isn’t it?”
“No, judging by the precedents, it’s not necessarily true. Usually, when testimonies contradict each other and it’s hard to distinguish, they’re just given less weight in the trial. It’s a common strategy.”
Oh…. I see…
“But… how do you even know all this?”
“I gathered information and studied it over the past two days.”
“….”
Maybe the real genius is not her sister but her. 
While admiring her in my heart, I hurriedly sought Amelia’s advice, feeling uneasy.
“So, what do you think I should do?”
“The trial is a certainty, so the first priority is to find someone from those who helped you back then who’ll testify for you.”
“And then?”
“Ask Melbes for help. As an organization with a long history, they’ve probably experienced these disputes numerous times. They must have a skilled judge somewhere.”
“Okay, and next?”
Amelia avoided my gaze, seemingly overwhelmed by my expectant eyes.
“….my expertise lies in investigation, not in coming up with solutions.”
Right, she has nothing else in mind.
“Uncle, is there anything I can do to help?”
Erwen, who had been listening intently but hadn’t joined the conversation, spoke up.
I was grateful. 
But….
“If anything comes up where I need help, I’ll let you know. Until then, don’t worry about it.”
I’ve fulfilled my duties as the deputy leader. It’s time to fulfill my role as the clan leader. 
***
After four days, I finally got off work. 
My body ached, and I just wanted to lie down and roll around, but I immediately left the house and headed to the Mozzlan headquarters. As the saying goes, “A stitch in time saves nine.” Before I start planning a strategy, I need to gather information.
I had no major complaints so far. 
However, there was one thing that bothered me. 
“….Why did they have to call me to the headquarters?”
The Mozzlan branch, where Dwarki was arrested the other day, was in the 7th district because it was under that jurisdiction. But the Mozzlan headquarters was located in the Imperial Capital, Karnon.
“….Should I just use the military teleportation platform, even if it’s a bit expensive?”
The thought of it crossed my mind, but as the clan leader of the Adabada Clan, I suppressed the temptation.  How much does it cost to use that thing just once? I can minimize time wasted by sleeping during the trip.
“Welcome to the headquarters. This way, Baron Yandel. I’ll show you around.”
As soon as I arrived at the Mozzlan headquarters, I was greeted by a knight, who, without me even needing to mention my identity, bowed respectfully. 
Is this what they call times have changed?
Of course, I wasn’t there for a good reason this time, but I remember when I visited for the Dwarki case, they wouldn’t even let me step foot in the building. Even though it wasn’t the headquarters but the branch.
Anyway, that’s not important right now.
“This is Christina Bealon, the Chairman of Mozzlan.”
The leader of Mozzlan, who greeted me, was a middle-aged woman with an elegant appearance. She was wearing casual clothes, but since she was part of Mozzlan, this woman had to be a knight.
“Bealon? Are you talking about the Bealon Count’s family?”
“Yes. The Count Bealon is my older brother.”
“I see. But does the Chairman usually handle this kind of thing?”
“Actually, it’s not usually like this. However, disputes between titled nobility are very sensitive matters. I decided to greet you personally, just in case I made a mistake.”
“Really? Then hurry up. The letter said you’d tell me all the details once I visited.”
“Yes, there are some limitations to what can be discussed through letters. Ahem, I’m not sure where to begin…”
The woman looked at me cautiously and began to speak in a gentle tone. 
However, as expected of someone from noble lineage, the introduction was long, and it wasn’t until after she went over the details of the contents of the letter that she got to the main point.
“…Usually, we recommend that you reach a settlement in these cases. Count Alminus also promised to reduce the amount he requests, as long as you agree, Baron Yandel. But…”
The woman looked up at me.
“You won’t want that, will you?”
Of course not.
“Of course not.”
“Then there’s nothing else to do but refer the case to the Royal Judgement Court.”
The Chairman then explained the procedure for transferring the case to the Judgement Court and what I had to do. This included writing a statement.
“If you want, I can summon the Archivist right now.”
I postponed writing the statement. 
After all, it’s a statement for the trial.  It’s best to write it strategically after consulting with a lawyer.
So, I left the building and immediately went to the Rabbit Baron’s family.
“Baron Yandel…? I haven’t been informed of your visit.”
The one who greeted me was the Baron’s daughter. Unfortunately, the Rabbit Baron was at the palace for work. Apparently, he’ll be back later today, so I decided to wait.
How much time had passed?
“Baron Yandel, what brings you here? Miniya told me you’ve been waiting for half a day….”
“Rilivia Baron, I need your help.”
“Help… is that right? Tell me everything.”
The Rabbit Baron, who arrived as the day drew to a close, let out a deep sigh after listening to my story.
“I might be stepping out of line, but… you really seem like someone born in the midst of a storm, Baron Yandel.”
“….”
“Don’t worry too much, I know a skilled judge.  I’m not sure if it’s possible today, but you can meet him tomorrow.”
“Thanks for taking care of that.  By the way, do you have an empty room?”
“An empty room, you say…?”
“It would be a hassle to go back home and come back tomorrow.”
“….You’ve been staying at Rabigion, haven’t you? I understand. I’ll tell someone to free up a room for you.”
“Thanks.”
Okay, lodging is settled.
After that, I had dinner with the Rabbit Baron’s family. Then, I borrowed a crystal ball and informed Erwen and Amelia that I’d be staying overnight.
The next morning.
“It’s a pleasure to meet you, Baron Yandel. I’m James Elk.”
I met the judge that Rilivia had recommended for me. 
The judge’s expression wasn’t good after listening to my entire story.
“….This is quite a headache.  Let’s summarize.  The case formally filed against you in Mozzlan is “demanding a share of the loot based on contribution,” correct?”
“That’s right.”
They’re spreading rumors as if I’m some kind of monster, but the gist of the lawsuit is that.
“After all, the Tusktooth Clan undoubtedly made contributions to this hunt, so they’re demanding their share.”
The grounds for the lawsuit were based on the Labyrinth Disaster Law. In the event of a disaster, each explorer had a duty to cooperate and overcome the disaster, and disputes over loot always arose.  As a result, relevant laws were established.
“It’s difficult….”
“…Is it that bad?”
“Yes.  Demanding a share of the loot based on contribution is a legitimate demand according to the Labyrinth Law. And judging by their boldness in making this demand, they undoubtedly have the means to prove their contributions.”
The judge, speaking in a subtle tone, addressed me.
“What do you think about accepting the offer from the Alminus Count’s family? Even if you go to the Judgement Court, you’ll ultimately end up minimizing the share you pay out, but a worse outcome is also possible.”
“….even though there’s evidence that they summoned the Tiered Monarch without permission?”
My voice involuntarily became gruff.
The judge, however, continued to respond in a professional tone.
“That’s irrelevant to this case. It’s still just evidence, isn’t it? It’s difficult to prove, and even if you do, it’ll become a separate case from the loot distribution.”
In other words, they want me to pay the share regardless of whether they’re fined or imprisoned later.
“I’m telling you the truth so you can make the choice you want, so please don’t take offense.”
Huh, fine, I won’t blame him.
“James, isn’t there any way?”
“I’m repeating myself, but I recommend you negotiate.  If you use that “evidence” as a weapon, you can reduce the share you’re required to pay significantly. You’ll take on much less risk.”
“What if I don’t care about the risk? Is there really no way?”
Even with my blunt questioning, James didn’t change his position.
“Yes.  This is the best option.  You won’t be able to stop paying the share.  Unless, of course, the Alminus Count’s family withdraws the mediation request they’ve filed with Mozzlan.”
Right, I see.
I ended my legal consultation. I didn’t really gain anything, but thanks to James, I’ve established a direction for the future. 
‘I need to get them to withdraw.’
The point is to make the Alminus Count back down.  In other words, I need bullets to threaten him. 
***
After the legal consultation.
I immediately visited Mozzlan and, with the help of the judge, completed my statement in a way that would benefit me the most.
Ideally, I’d like to avoid going to trial, but you never know.  I need to prepare for all possibilities.
‘The trial will take two or three months, they said.’
There’s still plenty of time, so I postponed meeting with Count Alminus. After all, what would change if I went now?
So….
Clang-!
On my way back, I visited the Explorer’s Guild. 
I was treated not by a normal guide but by the branch manager, and I filled out a subjugation request form.
[Dreadfear, the Monarch of Fear.]
The subjugation target is the Tiered Monarch on the 1st floor, that very beast.
“…It’s been a while since we’ve had a subjugation request.”
Of course, it has.  A 5th rank clan has various other options when aiming for a 4th rank promotion.  Usually, only those who’ve been established for a short time but have the skills to quickly advance aim to subjugate this beast.
“The subjugation date is right after the next Labyrinth opens… I need to send official documents to each branch immediately.”
Fortunately, there were no problems with the authorization.
“You know, once the official documents are out, it’ll be a complete pandemonium.”
Of course I do.  That’s exactly what I want.
“Five people to participate in subjugation….”
“….”
“If you succeed, it’ll be the tenth feat after the last Great Sage.”
It was the first bullet I was going to use against Count Alminus.
