## Chapter 478: Big Catch (1)
The adult initiation ceremony was being conducted for the second time since I became the chieftain. Having done it once already, I managed to finish the process much faster than before.
“Hmm, were there no new players this time?”
None of the young warriors in this batch showed any behavior that could raise suspicion as a player.
A great relief.
The warriors wouldn’t need to worry about having their bodies taken over, and the players wouldn’t need to live in constant fear of being labeled as evil spirits.
That damned game should disappear.
“Caron.”
“Speak, chieftain.”
I took the opportunity to inquire about the new warrior from the second elder beside me.
“Vekta, the third son of Kiltau? Ah, the one who chose the shield during the last initiation ceremony!”
“Yes. How’s he doing?”
“Hu-hu-hu, seems you’re rather concerned about the one who chose a shield, aren’t you?”
“Just answer my question.”
“He’s doing well. I hear he was quite impressive in the labyrinth… ”
As I pressed for more details, Caron, the social butterfly of the Barbarian tribe, began to spill the latest news.
“He’s somewhat like you, it seems. Like how you reached the second floor in your first exploration, he also made it to the second floor with the warriors in his team.”
“The second floor…?”
The new warrior actively utilized the team system and the starting item that I introduced.
He traded a potion with another explorer to buy a torch, cleared the dark zone with it, and on the second floor, he acted as a tank with his shield, protecting the other warriors.
“Chieftain, he seems to have earned a considerable amount of money in his first exploration and even managed to pass the checkpoint.”
That’s right. He’s quite clever. He’s already adapting well.
Even with game knowledge, it couldn’t have been easy.
However, there was one thing I was concerned about.
“If he continues to be so reckless, he’ll catch the eyes of those Secret Police’s evil spirit hunters…”
Well, it’s his own problem to solve.
If he’s the type to blurt out things like “I’m from America. Where are you from?” to someone he just met, he’s doomed from the start anyway.
“I should include a torch for the next batch as well.”
“Oh, good idea.”
After our conversation ended, I led the young warriors towards the city without any further chatter.
And then it happened.
“Chieftain.”
Caron, who had been following beside me, called my name in a strained voice.
“I… found out something recently.”
“…?”
“I discovered the cause of death for the warriors who died this time. You had asked me to investigate, remember?”
Ah, right, that.
The first thing I did upon returning to the holy ground was to check the casualties from this batch.
Seven warriors had died.
A record-breaking survival rate of almost 90% in the first exploration.
However, I wasn’t satisfied with that number.
I provided potions, shoes, and even cast binding magic, grouping them into teams of three or four. How could three of them die?
“So, what was the cause of death?”
Caron replied in a somber tone.
“It seems they were robbed. I found several reports on the guild about a corpse of a fellow Barbarian being discovered in the Crystal Caverns.”
“… ”
“According to the reports, there were signs of them being attacked by humans, not monsters.”
“I see… so that’s it.”
I had expected it, so I accepted it easily.
However, there was one point that still puzzled me.
“It’s still odd. They were in teams of four, yet they were robbed by raiders. And on the first floor.”
“Actually… that’s what I found strange too. So I looked into it further. And… ”
Caron trailed off, then spoke quietly, so that the young warriors behind us wouldn’t hear.
“The price of our hearts has skyrocketed recently.”
As the chieftain responsible for the Barbarian tribe’s future, those words sent a chill down my spine.
“The price has risen…?”
“Exactly. The standard price announced by the Magic Tower has increased by several fold.”
“Damn it.”
Now I understood the situation.
Since they’re no longer easy prey, the supply has decreased, naturally increasing the scarcity.
The price of hearts would have skyrocketed over time.
“Millions of stones for one heart… those greedy bastards would do anything for it.”
They’d earn more from this than from exploring floors four or five.
No matter how many potions I gave them or how many teams of three or four I made.
If professional raiders with superior specs started operating on the first floor, the young warriors would have no chance of survival.
“The explorers who saw the corpses said most of them had been killed almost instantly.”
Those damn bastards.
“Clack… ”
I’ll need to take drastic measures.
***
After leading the young warriors to the Dimensional Square, I grouped them into teams of three or four and cast binding magic on them with the help of the waiting mage.
By the way, this time it wasn’t a mage from the guild.
Since we have a mage on our team now.
“It’s just a low-level spell… but, with so many people, it’s a bit tiring.”
“Thank you, Bercile Goulhand.”
“Ah… I wasn’t trying to show off…”
“It doesn’t change anything. When you’re grateful, you need to show it properly.”
As I patted Bercile on the shoulder with a grin, Amelia sighed, as if disliking something.
“…Here we go again, that guy.”
I had no clue what she was referring to.
“Yande, let’s go. We should get into the labyrinth.”
Finally, with the warriors properly settled, we entered the labyrinth.
“You’ve entered the Crystal Caverns on the first floor.”
The Crystal Caverns on the first floor, a place that always brought back memories.
We headed straight for the central dark zone.
“…It’s strange, being back here.”
Bercile murmured in a strange voice, staring at the monument.
Was she bothered by the memory?
“What’s so strange? You just opened a dimensional gate and escaped. At least that’s how I remember it.”
Erwen’s subtle jab made Bercile flinch.
Fortunately, she didn’t react sensitively and apologized instead.
“…I’m sorry.”
I jumped in, trying to lighten the mood.
“Why apologize? It’s not your fault.”
But was it that phrase that bothered her?
For the first time in a long time, Erwen countered my words directly.
“It’s my fault. If no one had run away and we had fought together, more people could have survived.”
Right, she lost her sister back then.
“There’s always a price to pay for the wrong choices.”
“…That’s right. That’s why I had to pay the price.”
As if genuinely regretting the incident, Bercile responded to Erwen’s harsh words with a gentle tone.
Erwen didn’t retort further.
Instead, she even apologized to me.
“…I’m sorry, sir. I’m making the atmosphere weird because of me.”
“Ah… no. It’s okay. It’s not weird at all.”
“Then… that’s good.”
What? When did she become so calm?
I was slightly annoyed, but considering that she lost her sister, recovering her composure this quickly…
“Bjorn! So when’s that guy gonna show up? I’ve been waiting for this day!”
Ainar exclaimed in a cheerful tone.
Amelia frowned at him.
“Barbarian, you’re asking me something I told you several times during the last meeting.”
“…I forgot!”
“And?”
“I, I’m sorry…?”
“Much better.”
Ainar cowered at Amelia’s words, having learned his lesson from the last time.
Still, he was curious and asked the same thing again.
“So… when can we fight him? I remember how to fight him, pretty much!”
Amelia finally relented and answered.
“…Day seven.”
“That, that long? We can summon him starting day three, can’t we?!”
“Amazingly, you’re saying the same thing as you did during the meeting.”
The first floor’s floor lord has a chance of appearing starting day three, when five or more people gather in one place.
It’s a matter of chance, but the probability increases exponentially as time passes. Basically, it’s a 100% summon within a day.
Therefore…
“We’ll prepare for the summon from day six in the evening.”
On day seven, when the labyrinth closes, we can summon it for sure.
That’s also how we’re going to do the five-man strategy.
“So… are we just going to wait here for the whole time?”
Ainar looked like he was already bored to death.
I could already see him complaining about being bored every day, but it was no problem.
“Ainar, don’t worry. You’ll be doing something with me while you’re waiting.”
“Oh! Really?!”
Ainar was thrilled to hear my words, but Amelia tilted her head.
“…Yande, what do you mean by ‘doing something’? I haven’t heard anything about that.”
Well, of course.
This was a plan that came up on the way here.
“We shouldn’t stay together as five before day six, right? You three rest here. I’ll be back, and I’ll be on time.”
“…What are you planning?”
Amelia seemed concerned that I might cause trouble again.
Come on, don’t be so suspicious.
“Don’t worry. We’re just going for a stroll, just the two of us.”
Of course, we’ll be removing all our expensive gear first.
Like a newbie who’s just entered the labyrinth.
***
I left the group with Ainar.
Erwen wanted to help, but I gently declined.
Simple reason.
What we’re about to do can only be done by a Barbarian.
Therefore…
Thump, thump.
I’m walking through the cave with Ainar.
No destination, just wherever our feet take us.
“… ”
“… ”
I’ve already stored all our equipment in my subspace and changed into the Barbarian newbie set.
One pair of boots.
A cloth backpack.
A pouch that hangs from the waist.
And one iron weapon left over from the initiation ceremony because no one chose it.
“…Bjorn, do you think they’ll believe us if we do this?”
Ainar was a bit skeptical, despite knowing my plan and agreeing to it.
“We’re both quite famous… ”
“Famous for our names, not our faces.”
“You don’t get it! I might be unknown, but you’ll be recognized for sure!”
I doubt that.
A person’s first impression is determined by the situation they meet, their appearance, and their aura.
“Even so, we’re this old… Everyone will think something’s wrong.”
She worries too much.
Barbarians age slowly, and other races can’t even tell the difference between us.
Ah, based on my own experience.
Everyone gets excited when I approach them with a delicious look—
“Grrrr, grrrr.”
A goblin appeared from a gap between the crystal rocks.
And…
Swoosh-
It was instantly slaughtered by Ainar’s iron sword.
I couldn’t help but shout in surprise.
“Ainar! What are you doing?!”
“Why, why are you yelling? I, I just saw a goblin and swung my sword…”
Ainar was protesting in a voice laced with injustice, his expression filled with surprise.
“That’s the problem! You killed it too easily!”
“…What should I do then?”
“I’ll show you.”
I then showed him how to fight by finding a level 9 monster.
“Grrr, grrrr…!”
The opponent was a single goblin.
“… ”
I gripped the weapon in my hand, staring into the vicious beast’s eyes.
Clank.
My grip tightened, shaking the end of the sword.
“Ba, Ba-hel-laaaa!”
Praying for the ancestor god’s blessing, I swung the greatsword randomly. Naturally, the goblin dodged it.
And…
Crack-!
After swinging it three or four more times, I finally landed a blow, defeating it instantly with my basic stats.
Swoosh-!
I rushed to pick up the fallen magic stones, like someone who hadn’t eaten in days.
“How about that? Can you do it?”
“Bjorn… even for the first exploration, no warrior would fight that badly… Even I— ”
Ah, he’s talking back again?
“So, can you do it or not. Just answer that.”
“I… I’ll try… ”
“And, always shout your battle cry. It’ll make them think we’re fighting seriously.”
Shouting the ancestor god’s name at a level 9 monster. But Ainar followed my instructions, suppressing his shame.
“Ba, Ba-hel-laa… ”
Her enthusiasm was dampened, but that was good enough.
So, the basic training was over.
All that remained was the real deal.
“Okay, now we’ll keep moving like this. Got it?”
“Understood… ”
We then began to roam the Crystal Caverns, engaging in fierce battles with level 9 monsters.
We kept our distance from human explorers, cautious of them. When we got hungry, we ate the rock cakes we used to eat back in the day, filling our empty stomachs.
This is what we call the Barbarian Angler mode.
It took a lot of willpower to maintain this state.
No matter how much I controlled my strength, even a single hit was enough to kill a goblin…
But I got used to it as I gained experience.
Day one, day two.
Time flew by.
Sadly, we still hadn’t gotten a nibble yet.
But there was no reason to doubt myself or feel disappointed.
“Maybe the raiders will be more careful on days one and two because of the heavy foot traffic.”
Day three started. All the explorers leaving the first floor had ascended to higher floors.
Drrrrrrr, Drrrrrrrrrr…
I was on watch duty, keeping Ainar asleep, and just as I was dozing off, I got a nibble, for the first time.
Thump, thump.
Four explorers approached, not even trying to hide their presence.
They had decent equipment.
“At least level four… ”
That wasn’t important.
Thump.
The group, spread out in a circle, stopped their steps as they neared me.
And…
“Seriously, there are only a few of them, yet how much they roam around. How difficult it is to find them?”
One of them grinned at me, a smug look on their face.
Amazingly, it was exactly what I was thinking.
“Finally found them.”
You bet.
Grin.
Finally found them.
