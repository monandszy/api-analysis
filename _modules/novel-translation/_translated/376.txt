## Treasure Hunter (4)
They gripped their weapons, but didn't aim.  Their motives remained unclear.  Unnecessary provocation could easily turn a simple matter into a complex disaster.
"What should we do?"
"Talk to them first."
"I'll be ready."
"Right."
"Erwen, don't make any sudden moves until I give you the signal."
I stepped forward, as if shielding my companions.  How much time had passed?  
Thud, thud.  
A group of fifteen explorers stopped outside our campsite. A man who seemed to be their leader slowly approached.
"Thankfully, we don't need to wake you."
"Introduce yourselves first."
"Ha-ha, don't be afraid. We won't do anything you're thinking."
Who said I was afraid?  I was merely assessing whether I needed to smash his skull.
'Four ranged, two mages, nine melee… no cleric?'  
However, the fact that there were fifteen of them was quite intriguing.  After the six-person bond was established, the basic unit became six.  Perhaps the remaining three were hiding somewhere else.
"Suspicious fellow. Calm down and let's chat. If you have ill intentions, why would you even bother talking to us?"
I still had to see it to believe it.  I casually scanned the waiting group behind him before fixing my gaze on the man.
"Cut the crap. What's your business?  You know it's not a good idea to loiter near someone else's campsite in the dead of night, right?"
The man revealed his identity in response to my question.
"We are from the Huntsmen Clan."
"Never heard of them."
"That's understandable.  To be blunt, we're not a very famous clan.  We've been busy treasure hunting on Pione Island lately, so we rarely engage in external activities."
"Treasure hunting…."
I finally understood why this guy was here.
"I don't know if you're aware of this, but Pione Island is divided into six clans, each operating within their own designated territory. It's a measure to prevent indiscriminate conflict."
"So?"
"The place where you're camping is within the territory of our Huntsmen Clan.  We'd appreciate it if you could leave tomorrow morning."
Sure enough, it was a hunting ground control issue.  It's a situation every explorer experiences from the fifth floor onward, a brutal reminder that the labyrinth is a world of survival of the fittest.  
His first impression wasn't great, and now it was even worse.
"I don't recall ever hearing about the royal family granting specific rights to Pione Island to a particular group."
"Ha-ha, you have a rough exterior but speak like someone who follows rules.  When was the last time an explorer's life went according to plan?"
He didn't say another word after that.  He simply stared at me, waiting.  His next words would likely depend on my decision.
I didn't hesitate.
"Don't worry. We were planning on leaving tomorrow anyway."
We had only come for the night, so I didn't see the point in starting a conflict over hunting ground rights.  But did he think I was dodging the issue?
"Ha-ha, is that so?  I guess we came on a wild goose chase.  Thank you for understanding."
The man, who had been watching us with a hint of suspicion, now smiled with ease.  He seemed to have decided that we weren't much of a threat.  Especially after listening to that drivel.
"By the way, three people is quite unusual.  Did you lose any companions on your way here?"
"That's none of your business."
"Don't be so wary. We're just trying to be helpful.  If a monster suddenly appears, it could be dangerous.  We could offer you a spot in our campsite… but…"
He glanced at Erwen and Amelia behind me.
Ha, this guy really has a talent for pissing people off.
"Appreciate the offer, but we'll pass."
"Hmm, is that so?  But the two ladies might have a different opinion."
He insisted despite our polite refusal, and only after Erwen and Amelia gave a firm rejection did he finally back down.
"We decline."
"We're not incapable of handling things on our own."
"That's a shame. Our clan branch is in the 8th district of Ravigeon. If your team disbands and you have nowhere to go, come visit us."
Ha, he's being a real jerk until the very end.
"Alright, let's head back to the campsite!"
I barely managed to suppress a chuckle as I watched him lead his group away.
"Why did you hold back, Dad?"
"Can't just swing a hammer at someone just because you're a little annoyed."
"Oh, I thought that's what you always did?"
Both Erwen and I ignored Amelia's comment.
"If I had stepped in, those trash wouldn't have been so rude…"
Erwen expressed her frustration openly, but it was an unavoidable decision.  She attracts attention and rumors wherever she goes.  I didn't want to expose our information to outsiders, however small it might be.  But saying that would be tactless.
"Thank you anyway, Erwen."
"…For what?"
"For holding your anger even though you were so upset."
"Well… you told me not to step forward."
"I appreciate that.  It was brave and admirable."
"Is… is that so?  It's nothing.  I could do it every day."
I deflected the topic instead of giving a detailed explanation.  After all, the most important thing is to vent emotions.
"It ended pretty early, huh?"
"What's so strange about that?  Alright, let's get some sleep. We have to go far tomorrow.  You got it, Erwen?"
"Yes!"
We quickly settled the situation and returned to our sleeping bags.  
How much time had passed?
"Schuitz, wake up."
Amelia shook my shoulder urgently.  What the heck, were those guys back already? 
"Calm down. It's not a person this time."
"…What?"
Not a person?  Then what the—
"Could it be…?"
I quickly turned my head and scanned the surroundings.  Then, I saw what I was looking for.
[Gik, gik?]
The only monster that appears on Pione Island.  
A Grade 4 rare species, the Raplemimic.
***
Raplemimic.
This monster is known to drop a numbered item upon defeat, and if it drops essence, you can earn tens of billions of stones.  Although it appears in other fields as well, it's nowhere as common as on Pione Island.  
It's considered a good day if one appears in a month, but that's for the whole island.
"…To think I'd encounter this thing in a place I was just passing through."
Yeah, that's the thrill and romance of exploration.
"Schuitz, what do you think?"
Amelia whispered softly, and I replied.
"What do you think I'm going to do?"
You think I'd give up this guy because of those guys?
"Of course we're catching it."
"…I knew you'd say that. I'll go wake up Erwen."
Amelia headed towards Erwen's sleeping bag to wake her up, and I belatedly noticed something strange.
"Wait, Erwen? When did you two become friends?"
"She's kind of cute, actually."
Huh, you really can't figure out people's hearts.  Is this what they mean by growing attached while fighting?
"…Cute?"
"We didn't even need to wake her up."
"Wake up?  We're… what are you two doing?"
Erwen, who had just woken up, rubbed her eyes and sat up.  She then fixed her gaze on the box calmly rolling around about 20 meters away.
[Gik! Gik, gik?! Gik!]
True to its non-aggressive nature, the Raplemimic just showed curiosity and no hostility even though it saw us.
"Erwen, your role here is crucial.  We don't have a mage in our team."
"I know.  If there's no mage, we have to kill it in one shot, right?"
"That's right, otherwise it'll just hide underground."
If it hides underground, you might as well consider it gone.  So, in this situation, one-shot, one-kill is crucial…
"Erwen, shoot with all your might.  If possible, summon your shadow spirit too.  Oh, you know the box is the main body, right?  Don't shoot the vines if it looks like a body—"
"Don't worry. I'll definitely catch it!"
"Alright, I believe you."
We have no other choice but to believe her.  Erwen is undoubtedly the highest damage dealer among us.
"Then… I'll do it."
Erwen slowly drew her bow.  And at that moment.
「Erwen Fornach Di Tercia used [Elemental Synthesis].」
Fire, water, wind, earth, and even shadow.  The five elements merged into one, emitting an ominous aura.
Of course, the Raplemimic remained calm.
[Gik…?]
The Raplemimic tilted its head as if watching a curious phenomenon.  I felt a kind of biological guilt seeing its innocent form, but that was it.
We are explorers, after all.  Our job is to kill monsters and people to earn money.
"Thuk."
Erwen released the string after concentrating.
"Whiiii-ii-i-i-ing!"
The arrow shot forward at a speed so fast it was hard to see with the naked eye.
[Gi, gik-!]
The Raplemimic finally jumped in alarm, but it was too late.
"Kwaaa-aaa-aa-ng!"
The arrow flew straight into the Raplemimic's open mouth, exploding with a loud roar.  
However…
[Gi, gik…!]
Amazingly, it was still alive.  The box's lid was shattered, and its body was in tatters.
[Gik, gik-!]
The Raplemimic struggled to burrow itself into the ground, but Erwen was one step ahead.
「Erwen Fornach Di Tercia used [Rupture].」
The Raplemimic was shattered into hundreds of pieces as the follow-up attack landed.
"Swaaa-aa-aa-aa!"
Soon, the fragmented pieces turned into rays of light and disappeared.
「You defeated the Raplemimic. EXP +6」
The experience gain was noticeable, as expected of a Grade 4 monster.  The feeling was always satisfying, but I was focusing on something else.
'Essence… it didn't drop, as expected.'
I wasn't expecting it.  To have wished for it would have been greedy.
'Please, just be in the five thousand range.'
Two objects landed where the Raplemimic had been.
One was a magic stone.
And the other was…
"A ring…?"
As I approached and checked the loot, I burst into a chuckle.
"Huh…."
"Schuitz, is it something you know?"
How could I forget?  I almost died because of this thing before.
No. 6111 Fate Tracker.
The ring the Dragon Slayer had been wearing when I met him in Larkaz's maze.
'It's not a bad item, but it's a bit disappointing….'
"What kind of ring is it? Is… is it good for archers?"
Erwen's eyes gleamed with greed.  She rarely showed such desire, but numbered items are tempting, even for her.
"It's not an item that's good for any specific type of explorer."
"Not good for any type?"
"If I have to categorize it, it's a detection-type magical tool.  When something happens around you, the ring will show a color that indicates whether the event is positive or negative."
There are three colors in total.
Green, red, and yellow.
That's why I usually call it the traffic light ring.
"Having one can't hurt, so it's better to keep it than sell it."
"…Then can I wear it?"
"You?  But don't you already have tons of rings you wear?  I'll just wear this one."
"Oh, right. Yeah! Th… that's better, right?  Right?"
After getting Erwen's consent, I slipped the ring on my finger without hesitation.
And at that moment.
「The ring sensed the character's fate.」
The ring lit up.
