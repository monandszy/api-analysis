## Rainbow (3)
Five days had passed since the monsoon began. We escaped the village by our own strength and reached the mainland.
[*Grrrrrrroooow!*] 
[*Keeyeeeek!*]
[*…Kerung! Kung! Kerung!*]
It was worse than just a mess. Monsters swarmed everywhere, clashing with each other, splattering blood and flesh. But there was a clear difference from the first day the monsoon began.
*Crack-*
While monsters still fell from the sky, they had drastically decreased. 
"There were barely any compared to the first day…"
"The rain has gone from a hundred millimeters to a mere millimeter." 
"That damn village headman."
He couldn’t have been unaware of this. He must have known but chose not to tell me. 
*‘He must have thought the monsoon was dangerous, so I would stay in the village, depending on them. That way, he could hold me captive for longer.’*
I felt a renewed sense of unease toward the man. Despite being relieved that I had left the village on time, I deliberately cleared my mind.
*‘As someone who’s responsible for the lives of dozens… I have other things to focus on now.’*
Thankfully, the headman didn't follow me. No matter what scheme he had up his sleeve, for now, my worries had significantly reduced. 
Therefore…
“Form into a moving formation!"
I quickly gave orders. 
“We’re leaving this island now!"
I led the way, presenting a clear objective to my team. 
And…
“Behell—raaaaaaaah!!!"
I used my shield to block the monster’s fangs, then slammed my hammer against its jaw, breaking through. 
At the same time…
“Mages, gather as many magic stones as you can!"
I issued a new command. 
Why wouldn’t I? Magic stones were everywhere, and leaving them behind would be unacceptable for an explorer. It wasn’t like I could do anything about it before because of that headman…
*‘Now, I don’t need to worry about that anymore.’*
I suddenly realized that hammering is truly beneficial in social life. It clarifies relationships, particularly in a way that’s very helpful.
*Swoosh, swoosh, swoosh!*
The mages continuously cast looting magic, collecting mountains of magic stones. Although their contribution to combat had decreased as a result, it wasn’t a big issue. 
The reduced number of monsters falling from the sky had given us ample breathing room.
*‘At this rate, maybe no one will die.’*
As someone who had braced for the worst, I was ecstatic.
I continued to forge the path ahead, standing at the forefront, wrestling with the most dangerous monsters.
About ten minutes later…
*‘You have slain a Steel Spirit. EXP+6.’* 
*‘You have slain a Baphomet.’*
*‘You have slain an Ainicorn. EXP+6.’*
*‘You have slain a Mud Golem.’*
*‘You have slain a Celestial Tree. EXP+5.’*
*‘You have slain a Dakion.’*
*‘…’.’*
Einar delivered good news as I slaughtered diverse species of monsters appearing indiscriminately. 
“Oooo! My soul… My soul… it’s overflowing with energy!!”
I expected her to level up soon, and she finally did. 
"With this, I am even stronger now!!"
While it was only her soul energy that had increased for now, it was still meaningful. Another slot for a Core essence had been added to her already full essence slots.
*‘It seems like the Hekts clan and Armin Expedition group are leveling up in real-time too.’*
Overall, essence slots had increased from +1 to +2.
I took decisive action.
"My… Lord Baron, a Grade 4 essence has appeared…"
"From now on, anyone can absorb the essences that appear. I won't worry about anything below Grade 3!"
While I felt it was a waste to change the distribution ratio I had carefully set, it wasn't a major loss. 
There wasn’t time to put them into vials right now anyway. Any increase in our power was welcome.
"Woooohooo!!"
This measure significantly boosted the morale of the explorers. 
Just as there were different perspectives on a half-full glass of water, the explorers began to view the situation not as a crisis but as an opportunity.
*‘Not bad.’*
The overall atmosphere was positive, but optimism alone could not overcome every obstacle.
[*Keeeyooowwwwooo-*]
A colossal bird blocked our path, roaring from afar. 
Well, I’m not sure if ‘bird’ is the right word.
*Woom-*
Ah, so things were going smoothly, I thought.
*‘…They won’t let us leave so easily, I guess.’*
I took a deep breath and closed my eyes. When I opened them, nothing had changed. I hoped I had been mistaken, but…
White feathers and wide-spread wings, a drake-like body with a giraffe-like, elongated neck. 
And at the end of that neck…
A face with human-like features.
It was such a famous monster that I felt terror before any sense of disgust at its grotesque appearance.
"T, That’s… the Manticore!!"
A Grade 2 flying type, Manticore. 
It was the first obstacle in escaping the island.
***
After flying down from the sky and landing, the Manticore looked us over with a blank expression, its eye corners curving abnormally long.
[*Keehiheeheeheeehee.*]
Ugh, why are there so many monstrous-looking creatures in [Dungeon and Stone]?
The Manticore’s repulsive appearance was different from the Corpse Golem. If someone hadn't experienced fighting monsters firsthand and seen blood splatter, they would have shivered at the sight of that face. 
I couldn’t give orders immediately. 
“Mages! Create a protective barrier!”
Explorers with experience fighting Grade 2 or higher monsters were few and far between even in this city. 
But I had encountered these creatures countless times. Even if it was in the game.
My experience gave me the ability to make instant judgments when facing them.
*Whoosh!*
As soon as the mages raised a translucent shield like an umbrella, the Manticore’s whites turned black.
And…
*‘The Manticore has cast [Song of the Apocalypse].’*
A beam of bright yellow light descended from the sky. Countless beams.
*Kaboom! Ka-Kaboom! Kaaa-booming!*
As if the sky were angry and unleashing its judgment, the light beams rained down for ten seconds, turning the surroundings into ashes.
Despite its impressive visuals, the actual damage wasn’t that high. It didn’t penetrate the barrier. 
However…
[*Keehiheeheehee-*]
Baby Manticores rose from where the light beams had struck the ground.
They were token-type summon monsters.
“Everyone! Take care of those first!”
This was a race against time. Those baby Manticores would fully grow and start using skills after one minute.
In theory, they could multiply endlessly. If those little brats start using [Song of the Apocalypse], then there’d be no turning back…
“Yandel, give orders!”
Ah, I shouldn't be spacing out.
"Erwen…"
I automatically called out to Erwen but shut my mouth.
She was in a state of ‘retirement’ right now. Since she had used all her MP to escape the village, she could not interfere with combat at this moment.
But…
*‘…Since when did I rely on Erwen alone?’*
A barbarian’s spirit is to chew with bone if they lack teeth. 
“Amelia, Misha! Follow me! Einar, you stay with the main force… Versil! Take care of the rearguard, assess the situation and act accordingly!”
I dashed forward, and Amelia and Misha followed closely behind. Amelia on the right, Misha on the left.
*‘Wait a minute.’* 
This position…
“Yandel, I’ll let you know in advance.”
“…Yeah?”
“If you try that again… I swear I’ll kill you.”
Ugh, is this not going to work?
“…That won't happen.” 
“I… I’m okay with it…”
Despite Misha’s agreement, I couldn’t forcibly merge with her while she was recoiling and refusing. 
She wasn’t as massive as the Hiphrama, so there wasn’t much reason to do so.
*Woom!*
The Manticore was roughly the same height as me when I was in [Overlimit] and using [Gigantification]. 
The way she stared at me like she had fallen in love at first sight, I guess it worked to get her attention. 
“Behell—raaaaaaaah!!!"
I charged and landed a Shield Charge.
[*Keeeyaaaaack!*]
The Manticore staggered from the blow, my full body weight behind it.
Without missing a beat, Misha and Amelia scattered to the sides, focusing their attacks on its lower body.
Simultaneously…
*Flash!*
A light burst from the Manticore’s blackened eyes.
*‘The Manticore has cast [Mark of Ruin].’*
Yeah, I knew it would hit me.
*Fwooosh!*
A searing pain like a fire engulfing my heart.
*‘Your character’s life force is decreasing by 1% per second.’*
Well, will I die in one hundred seconds, theoretically? 
*‘This is one messed up skill, no matter how you look at it.’* 
[Mark of Ruin] was a single-target ‘curse’ that couldn’t be dodged or blocked. However, it didn’t have a duration. 
In simple terms, it means that once you are hit, the curse stays active until either the Manticore dies or I die…
There was a simple countermeasure.
"Uaaaaah!!!"
I endured it, relying on my natural regeneration and the Priestess's healing.
“Yandel! Are you alright?” 
“Don’t worry about me! Just swing your swords!”
The Manticore was designed to be impossible to beat in a prolonged battle. I drew aggro and created an environment where the other damage dealers could attack, and it wasn't long before the ranged attackers joined in, launching concentrated barrages.
[*Keehiheehee…*]
As the battle dragged on, the Manticore started using other skills in quick succession.
*‘The Manticore has cast [Mimicry].’*
The monstrous human face on its massive body suddenly transformed into someone else's. 
It was several times larger than the original face, but it wasn’t hard to recognize.
"Ooo! It’s Amelia! The monster turned into Amelia!"
[Mimicry] was a skill that randomly cast one of the skills of the characters within its range. 
*‘The Manticore has cast [Self-Replication].’*
Damn it…
*‘Why that skill?’*
"Ooo! There are two… no, three Amelias!!!"
The boss had doubled in numbers, and one of the clones launched a new skill. 
*‘The Manticore has cast [Song of the Apocalypse].’*
Another beam of light rained down. 
*‘The Manticore has cast [Mark of Ruin].’*
*‘Your character’s life force is decreasing by 2% per second.’*
Ugh, that’s already a double stack. Can the Priestess handle it?
It was a futile worry.
*‘Why does bad news always come in succession?’*
*‘The Manticore has cast [Song of the Apocalypse].’* 
Eventually, one of the fully grown baby Manticores used the skill.
And finally…
*‘The Manticore has cast [Mark of Ruin].’* 
*‘Your character’s life force is decreasing by 3% per second.’*
A triple stack. 
Ugh, at this rate, the Priestess can't cover 100% of the damage.
This was a headache, but I couldn’t escape with [Mark of Ruin] active. 
There was only one answer.
"Die, you freak!"
As a proud K-Barbarian, I channeled the spirit of Admiral Yi Sun-sin and charged at the monster with everything I had.
*‘Your character’s life force is below 50%.’* 
*‘The passive skill [Hero’s Path] increases all resistance and immunity values.’*
I fought even more fiercely as the time I was given dwindled.
*‘The Manticore has cast [Guide].’*
*‘The Manticore has cast [Guardian Spirit].’* 
The Manticore went wild as the battle intensified.
And then, after what seemed like an eternity…
*‘Your character’s life force is below 20%.’*
*‘The passive skill [Hero’s Path] increases all resistance and immunity values to their maximum level.’*
At that moment, I sensed that the battle would soon reach its climax, no matter who won.
*Woom!*
Four messages appeared. 
To summarize, there were two good things and two bad things...
First, the good news was straightforward. 
*‘You have slain the Manticore. +EXP 8.’* 
Yes! The Manticore was finally dead.
And…
*‘No. 9999, Beginner’s Luck has been activated.’* 
Second, she also dropped an essence. It was white.
*‘[Mimicry], it is.’*
While it couldn’t be used as a Core essence like [Song of the Apocalypse], it was still a good essence due to its versatility.
However, the bad news...
"W, What?!”
"A spear… Why a spear suddenly…"
Was that it wasn’t us who delivered the final blow.
*Woom!*
Something emerged from the darkness, impaling the Manticore’s head with a gigantic spear, and then gripping it.
It wasn’t hard to identify.
A smallish (relatively speaking) figure about 3 meters tall. 
A human-shaped creature with smooth, rock-gray skin, like a statue.
“Titanus…! It’s a Titanus!”
Another Grade 2 monster had appeared. 
That was the first bad piece of news.
And the second…
*‘Oh crap.’*
It was the red spear the Titanus held.
No. 7, Millayell’s Verdant Spear.
*‘That… that guy has it…?!’*
I couldn’t make sense of it, but my mind calmly accepted the reality. 
*‘The Celestial Spearkeeper, Millayell, is enraged by discovering a mortal.’*
A Rift Guardian.
