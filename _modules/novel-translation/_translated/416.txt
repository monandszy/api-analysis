## The Storm’s Eye (2)
Huu... Huu... I exhaled, then took a deep breath. Each time, a plume of vapor escaped my mouth, as if I were a cigarette smoker.  
Dripping sweat froze as it fell to the ground. My muscles screamed in protest, and my vision blurred. But what could I do? 
Thud, thud. 
One step, then another.  I focused on my breathing, extending my leg with each stride.  I was at the very front of the two sleds, my grip tight on the rope to ensure I wouldn't be left behind. 
Thud, thud.
I kept pulling the sleds forward. The reason was simple. The Troll Summoner who had been responsible for pulling them, Milburn Naria, had been injured.
“How’s Milburn Naria?”
“...She won't last much longer.”
“...I see.” 
I gritted my teeth, recalling the battle from earlier. It hadn't been so bad initially.
“Character [Gigantism] activated.”
My giant form, hardened like rock, blocked the path. 
“Teirun Shaeardiem.”
The mages cast “Mana Shield.”
“Jun Arshen activated [Guardian Light].”
“Periton Eriaboti activated [Holy Skin].”
“Benjamin Orman activated [Damage Reduction]...”
The priests provided support with various shields and buffs. A strategy of choice and concentration. In other words, all-in.  It had been effective.
“All healing and recovery effects are reversed.” 
With every hit being a mortal blow, the enemy hesitated to attack me directly. In that situation, we leveraged the advantage of the uphill climb to unleash all our firepower.
We bombarded them with skills. 
Even used healing potions as offensive weapons, casting them on their side. 
I grabbed the neck of any enemy that dared to approach me and tossed them off the cliff. 
“Status effect [Whisper of Immortality] applied.”
“Upon death, the character will revive as an undead.”
The slain enemy revived as undead and attacked our allies, but we held our formation strong and continued our assault.  
However…
“Clearly, dealing with you alone was beyond our capabilities, Regal Bagos.” 
The situation changed once they joined the battle.
“Manua Repelles activated [Iron Fist].”
“Ricky Aimond activated [Punishment’s Step].”
“Puru’an Cullin activated [Divine Possession]…”
A dozen explorers armed with top-grade Essences, obtainable from the 8th floor.
The moment they joined the fight, our lines crumbled.
“Schwitz, Rayaders’s magic has run out!”
The mages casting “Mana Shield” on me started falling one by one. Even worse, they bypassed me and infiltrated the heart of our formation.
Three paladins. Two knights acting as auxiliary tanks. And one warrior from the third team.
Amelia and Ravien, along with the other melee damage dealers, fought back, but it was not enough.
“Re- Retreat! We must retreat!”
All the members, including me, felt the defeat.
The reason for our loss was simple. Their forces were far stronger than ours. Even with a last stand, we could inflict significant damage, but that's all. In the end, it would lead to our annihilation. 
Therefore…
“I'll completely give up on wiping them all out here.”
I immediately activated Plan B.
The core of Plan B was Milburn Naria, a summoner from the second team. She specialized in long-range, high-damage summoning. Her primary summons were three Ice Trolls, “Sorcerers.”
“Milburn Naria activated [Harsh Command].”
“Milburn Naria activated [Beast Taming].”
“Milburn Naria activated [Hidden Instinct].”
“Milburn Naria activated [Stability]…”
She cast all the buffs on her summons the moment my orders came through. 
Then…
“Summon Bibbi activated [Avalanche].”
“Summon Pobbi activated [Avalanche].”
“Summon Yebbi activated [Avalanche]…”
The Ice Trolls unleashed their skills, amplified dozens of times, buying us time to retreat.
However…
“Aagh!”
Naria was injured in the process. To maintain [Stability], which tripled her summons’ skill range, she had to move to the front lines, standing close to her Trolls.
Thankfully, she kept her focus even with the injury and continued summoning. We were able to retreat successfully.
Time has passed since then. 
“Schwitz… are you alright?”
“Don’t talk to me.”
“... ”
After Naria lost consciousness, all the members donned their backpacks and shared their rations. Even so, it only filled one sled.
Swoosh, swoosh. 
I pull the sled up the slope. I need to rotate with other warriors once it gets too difficult, but I can still hold on for now. I pushed those thoughts aside and focused on moving.
“Ugh…” 
Naria regained consciousness, lying on the sled. Despite being covered in thick furs and surrounded by heated stones, her first words were, 
“C-Cold… ” 
“Hold on a little longer. It's just because your body isn't doing well. Once we get to the top and you're healed, you'll feel better.”
“I-Is that so…? C-Cough!”
“Yes, it will be alright.”
No reply came.  I could hear her breathing, so she must have fallen unconscious again.
Whumph. 
It felt as if a cannonball had struck my heart. A sensation of suffocation that drove me mad. 
“What will be alright…? ” 
I desperately hoped she would survive. It was the truth.  
But I knew best that it was impossible. 
“No, she probably knows best.”
My body grew as cold as ice. The approach of death. 
“Home… ”
Then I heard another voice from behind.
“Home… I… want… to go… home…” 
It was Naria's voice. 
I gritted my teeth and uttered a lie in response to that powerless murmur. 
“You’ll get there. I promise.”
“Will… I?”
“Yes. If you hold on.”
“... ” 
Naria remained silent.  It wasn't until much later that I heard her voice again.
“Mr. Schwitz… please… leave me here.”
“...What do you mean?”
“I… need… to… be… of… use… This… is… the… place…”
I didn’t answer.  It wasn’t because I didn’t understand.
‘Whisper of Immortality’. 
The insidious field effect that makes the dead revive as undead, multiple times stronger than before.
She was offering to be of use, even in such a way.
“... ” 
“... ”
Silence hung in the air.
“Answer… me…”
Her voice made me admit defeat.  Lying any longer wouldn’t help her. No, it would be an insult.
“Alright. I’ll do as you wish.”
“... ”
“Is there anyone in the city you’d like to deliver a message to?”
Her response came after a long pause.
“...No. Not… anymore.”
“...Not anymore?”
“I… I’m… not… worthy…”
Her voice trembled and her words were scattered. A pattern that often occurs before death. 
“Aaah… I… truly… apologize…”
“I… didn’t… want… to… lie…  I… loved… you… all…”
“I… wish… I… was… the… one…!” 
“Khhukhukhukh…” 
I felt like there was a story behind it, but I didn’t pry further. I just listened to her mournful cries and moved forward.
How long had it been since then?
“Now… please… leave… me… down.”
I heard her voice, pronounced more clearly.
“Damn it.”
The warrior next to me cursed.
“May the warmth of light embrace your soul.”
The paladin closed his eyes and made the sign of the cross. As someone who had seen countless deaths, he had sensed the dying flame. 
“Ms. Naria… you’ve worked so hard.”
Acuraba, her team leader, gently smoothed Naria’s dishevelled hair. Then she carefully lifted Naria from the sled.
“Thank you… Acuraba-nim…”
“Thank you? No, it’s…”
Acuraba bit her lip as if restraining herself.  
The other members placed Naria's body on a pile of furs spread on the ground.
“…Go… Don’t… look… at… me…”
Despite her words, we couldn’t turn away. 
“It’s urgent. It’s alright. I’m fine… ”
“…Go.”
Damn it.
My heart throbbed with heat. 
But I knew better.
“Schwitz, she’s right. We must go now.”
I forced myself to move, pulling the sled again. 
“I… am… not… afraid… ” 
Naria closed her eyes, her voice weak.
“Finally… I’m… going… home… ”
Her murmuring faded as I took each step.
“The coffee… smelled… like… home… in… the… morning… ”
Damn it.
[Well, now I regret it. Could the Archbishop really have killed me? Haha….]
I finally understood the source of that unsettling feeling.
***
24 survivors.
The expedition, which began with thirty members, marched forward.  
Even amidst the precariousness of life, they carried a lingering disquiet.
“Ms. Naria’s ‘home’… ”
“She must be talking about it, right?”
These explorers had spent countless years in the labyrinth, experiencing much. 
Naturally, many knew. 
What dying evil spirits desperately desire.
“So… Ms. Naria was an evil spirit?”
“Shh! Be quiet. It’s not certain yet.”
The whispers spread among the members. 
Some were outraged by the mere suspicion. 
“Have you all lost your minds?! She was injured while saving us and helped us until her last breath! She chose to die alone for us! An evil spirit? Even if she was, what does it matter?!” 
A bad omen.
“No, we’re just… Isn’t it strange?! Why would an evil spirit… ”
“You damn fool! If you really don’t understand that, I’ll show you myself!”
This was getting chaotic.
“E-Enough!”
Kaislan intervened, shouting before a rift formed between the members.
“Have you all lost your minds?! We need to stand as one, even more than ever before!”
I didn’t stop his outburst. 
I’d learned something from this experience.
Sometimes, you need to completely crush others to lead a group.
“From this moment on, anyone who utters another word of nonsense, I will personally execute them under the strict laws of the royal family! Do you understand?!”
A drastic and authoritarian order.
The members seemed to have regained their senses, shutting their mouths and starting to look around nervously. 
Sadly, not everyone.
“...Try it.”
A whisper echoed through the silence.
The speaker was Futa Rickborn, a melee fighter and guide for the second team.
“...Try what?”
“You all know, don’t you? We’re done for!”
“This bastard…!”
“S-Stop! Lord Kaislan!”
Kaislan instantly drew his sword, but the knights around him held him back. 
Rickborn raised his voice even higher.
“You saw them earlier, right? They’re much stronger than us! More numerous too! What’s going to change if we run away? We’re going to be caught soon anyway.”
“...Let him go. It’s an order.”
Kaislan’s orders finally prevailed. The knight who had been holding him back sighed and stepped back. 
Damn it, if this continues, we’re going to be killing each other!
“Kaislan, step aside.”
There was no choice. I stopped the sled and headed towards the source of the commotion.
Then…
Crack.
I strode forward and grabbed the man by the throat. 
“Khh!”
“So, what are you trying to say? You’re going to give up and just die because there’s no hope? Is that what you really want? I could kill you before you can even say anything.”
“Khh, khh—!”
The man coughed but didn’t hide his defiant gaze. 
No, it was even more intense…
“Try it. If you want.”
His gaze, as if he didn’t care if he died, caught me off guard.
“...What?”
I loosened my grip and released the man. 
He screamed out his despair.
“What’s going to change if we miraculously escape them? A future where we return to the city and laugh and celebrate? Do you think that’s possible?!”
I need to shut this bastard’s mouth, even if I have to kill him.
That thought came late, as the man had already spewed out every thought in his mind.
“You know why the main force didn’t come to save us, right? We were abandoned! Not because something happened, but because it was planned from the beginning!”
“...W-What are you saying? Abandoned from the beginning?”
“H-Nonsense! The royal family wouldn’t use such important figures as pawns to be killed!”
“That’s what I thought too! Everyone was so great! That was the trap!”
“...A trap?”
The situation was already too late for me to handle. 
I sighed and observed the situation.
“I’m Futa Rickborn, affiliated with the Duke of Kearlunus’s family! I was heavily indebted to them when I was young, and I spent my later years dealing with their dirty affairs! When I said I wanted to retire, they had one last favor to ask. This expedition!”
“... ”
“Don’t you understand? I was abandoned! They couldn’t kill me directly, so they generously gave me a medal and tossed me into the trash!”
“... ”
“Hahaha! Everyone’s looking like I’m not the only one, huh? Everyone’s feeling a bit guilty, aren’t they?”
The man’s words ended there. A heavy silence descended upon the expedition. 
The calm before the storm.
“T-The guild abandoned me? No, no, that can’t be right. They said they’d forgive the embezzlement case if we succeeded in this mission… ”
Someone mumbled in panic.
Their gazes turned to each other.
‘Is that what you did too?’
Their gazes, filled with that question, focused most intensely on the team leaders. 
They hoped those with the highest reputations would step forward and assure them that it couldn’t be true.
But…
“...Perhaps… we were truly abandoned.”
Reality was cruel.
“Titana Acuraba constantly questioned the royal family about the dimensional collapse and demanded stricter management. Perhaps they resented that.”
It began with Acuraba.
“My clan leader has been showing a lot of signs of wanting to control me lately. But, just because of that… ”
The second was James Kala, vice-captain of the Tooth-Tooth clan.
“H-If I had to choose, I’d say I’m similar to Kala. I don’t care about my family’s title, but my older brother might have felt a sense of crisis. That’s why I joined the army when I was young.”
Kaislan.
And…
“I was an Inquisitor for the Tobera Church. Officially, my job was to hunt down and execute believers infected with Karui teachings. But… I was disillusioned when I saw them falsely accusing innocent rivals who had nothing to do with the Karui. There are quite a few bishops who want to hide their dirty secrets.”
Finally, Jun confessed.
With each team leader’s admission, despair crept into the expedition.
Despite that, some still held onto hope.
“Schwitz, what about you?”
“You received the Duke’s recommendation and got the captaincy of this expedition.”
“Are you really the same as the rest of us!”
Their gazes turned to me.
‘There’s no point hiding it now.’
I hesitated for a moment, then spoke. 
There was no need to explain at length like the previous examples.
“...I’m Bjorn Yandell.”
One sentence was enough.
