## The Pending Death (2)
The person I knew… well, calling him “someone I knew” might be an exaggeration. I only saw him once, during the raid on the Rift on the first basement floor. And even then, it was just a copy.
[Ah, since there are some who haven’t met me yet, I should introduce myself. I am Ravigeon Commelby Lapdonia.]
The founding king of Lapdonia, encountered within the Rift. A wise and tyrannical ruler who reigned over this city for millennia, known to the people as the “Immortal King.” We were shocked when we saw him in the Rift. Not only was it difficult to believe we were face to face with such a historical giant, but… 
“The king of Lapdonia always wears a mask when he appears…”
Whether it’s the royal palace, the heart of the nation, or the pamphlets distributed for propaganda, the king always appears wearing a mask. There were many rumors about it, like it was for security or to prevent assassination attempts, but no one knows the real reason.  
Only one thing is certain: Lapdonia’s kings always masked their faces when they appeared in public, as if it were a tradition.
“Why? Because he’s younger than you expected?”
The Overlord’s words snapped me out of my thoughts, and I quickly chose a response.
“Y-yes, I suppose.”
I decided not to mention the “Immortal King” I had seen in the Rift. There was no reason to, and it felt like I might be opening a can of worms.
“Haha! Even so, my voice shouldn’t have sounded like a shriveled old man, should it?”
Thankfully, the Overlord didn’t say anything more when I agreed. He simply laughed like a 40-year-old man who had been called young. 
And then…
“Well, before we go… let’s enjoy some fresh air.”
“As you wish, Your Highness.”
A knight immediately began to guide us, and I followed behind the Overlord.
Thump, thump…
As we walked slowly, a path leading to the garden appeared, and for the first time in a long time, I saw the sky.
‘How long has it been?’
It had been days since I was trapped inside, without even a glimpse of the sky. Ah, of course, the sky was cloudy, as usual.
“How much longer do you think I can live?”
A completely unexpected question, asked at a completely unexpected time.
“What do you mean, Your Highness?”
“What I said. Is it strange to talk about this? Even the Immortal King couldn’t achieve eternity in the end.”
Well, there’s no arguing with that.
He lived a life close to immortality, but he was still a mortal who ultimately couldn’t achieve eternal life.
“…Well, you seem quite healthy still, despite what people say.”
“People say… huh.”
His reaction to my comment, which I had casually thrown out without any expectations.
The Overlord then asked me a question in a soft voice.
“Curious, aren’t you? Why I’m cooped up in the royal palace without ever going outside.”
Agreeing here was a rookie move.
“I am curious… but it’s not something I need to know for sure.”
“Why not? Even though I am the king of this nation?”
“It’s none of my business, is it?”
“…What?”
The Overlord laughed heartily, surprised by my unexpected answer. I just stood there awkwardly.
While I apologize for being so rude, I really didn’t mean it. I never thought it was any of my business, and…
‘There’s definitely a reason why he’s staying put…‘
I also desperately wanted to know the reason.
‘I’m curious.’
Just as that thought crossed my mind…
Flash-!
For a moment, the entire world flickered.
And then…
Boom, boom, boom-!
It took a few seconds for the sound of thunder to register, before I fully understood the situation.
“…What?”
Lightning had struck. Right where we were standing.
“Your Highness, are you alright?”
Of course, no one was hurt by the lightning strike. A translucent shield had appeared around the Overlord.
“Don’t worry about me. Tsk, but it’s already starting… just after I came out.”
However, I couldn’t help but tilt my head at the Overlord’s mutterings. Something about what he said felt off.
‘Suddenly lightning strikes from a clear sky… yet he’s acting like nothing happened?’
Well, nobody got hurt thanks to the shield. But even so…
“Is… this… something that happens often?”
I cautiously asked, and the Overlord laughed heartily, playfully replying.
“I guess even the sky wants me dead.”
“…”
“Don’t worry. It’ll be quiet for a while from now on.”
…He says that, but it makes me even more curious. Is this related to what he said before about sleeping a lot?
“It’s been quite a while since I’ve been here.”
We walked through the garden for a long time, arriving at a clearing with a table and chairs set up. It was just a normal place, nothing special except that it looked perfect for a picnic.
“Is this the place you mentioned earlier?”
“What? Ah! No way. Were you thinking that while we were walking here?”
“…”
“The years have passed, but this place remains the same. Perhaps eternity is what they say, regarding this place.”
“It seems like a place with many memories for you?”
“…Well, yes. Many things happened here. Let’s take a break now that we’re here.”
“Yes…”
I replied and sat down on the grass. My first concern was whether I might damage the chair, which held the king’s memories, and my second was that we would be at eye level if I sat.
“…”
“…”
Even after we had taken our seats, the Overlord simply stared into the distance, lost in thought. We continued to sit in silence.
About five minutes passed.
“The Prime Minister is the one who started this war.”
“…Yes?”
“He pretended to be against the Noarkans, but secretly conspired with them to swallow this country. Are you really so surprised?”
No, how could I not be surprised?
He suddenly dropped that information, without any build-up whatsoever. It would have been nice if he had at least turned his signal lights on.
“Hm, really? The Intelligence Department thought you had a hunch.”
“W-well, to be honest, I didn’t completely ignore the possibility… but I wouldn’t say I predicted it. It’s closer to simply not dismissing the possibility.”
“It’s so strange to see someone like you talking so logically with that body. What kind of person were you?”
“…I was just a regular office worker.”
“Oh, a slave like you? The rulers in that world must have been blind.”
“I-I… office workers aren’t slaves…”
“Hm? You definitely explained it to me that way.”
The person who explained the job of an “office worker” to the Overlord must have been a very pessimistic person. It’s not important though.
“By the way, Your Highness, do you know why the Prime Minister did all that?”
“There’s nothing I don’t know in this world.”
…Should I add +7 to his ego stat?
The thought suddenly came to mind, but on second thought, it was probably not ego, but more like a lack of luck. 
After all, I really feel like he knows everything.
“So… why did he do it? The Prime Minister didn’t suddenly go insane.”
“Do you have a guess?”
“I have no idea. Even when the Noarkans suddenly appeared from the Prime Minister’s house, I couldn’t believe he was really behind it.”
“Why not?”
“Because I couldn’t think of a motive. If I had to pick one, it would be that he was greedy for power… but even that felt a bit off. The Prime Minister I knew wasn’t someone who would be that greedy.”
“Haha! That’s true. I also think the Prime Minister is timid and easygoing. But…”
The Overlord, who was continuing his playful tone, spoke seriously.
“It’s something that sometimes happens to people. There’s something they can’t give up, even if they lose everything in the world.”
A line that somehow stuck deep in my heart.
The first thing that came to mind was the mirror.
Beyond that mirror was me, and further beyond were the comrades who had become so precious to me.
That’s why I was even more curious. What was it that was in the Marquess’s mirror?
“…What was it for the Marquess?”
I asked, my throat tightening with nervousness, but his reply was less than underwhelming.
“Well, I’ve already said, it’s best to hear that story from him.”
Darn it.
Even though I swore under my breath…
It wasn’t completely without gain…
“So… is it true that the “Fox with a Tiger on its Back” is also referring to the Prime Minister?”
I asked, confirming it in a roundabout way, and a positive response came back.
“Of course. Are there any other foxes in this country besides the Prime Minister?”
“Well, I wouldn’t know. To be honest, we weren’t really close.”
“Not close? Haha! What an interesting guy, aren’t you?”
The Overlord didn’t stop smiling even as he said that. What’s so funny about this conversation, I wonder? Is it just that he hasn’t had a conversation with a person in so long?
‘For now… the atmosphere doesn’t seem bad?’
I don’t know for sure, but I think I can continue this conversation in a similar way. 
Just as that thought crossed my mind…
“Let’s talk about it properly inside.”
“Are we going to see ‘that’ again?”
“Yes.”
The Overlord gestured, and a knight walked ahead to guide us. We followed behind them towards the Overlord’s Palace.
‘Why did we even go out if we’re coming back in?’
We didn’t even go somewhere else in the Overlord’s Palace. We went back to the audience chamber where he had been cooped up. And we took the same elevator we had used the first time we came here, heading back down to the lower floors.
Ding-!
When the elevator doors opened, I saw a gigantic test tube, similar to the one I saw in Pantelion’s laboratory.
So, that’s what he was going to show me?
‘…So that’s it.’
I thought it was a big deal, but this time I kept my mouth shut. If he brought us this far, I thought there was a high chance he would explain what it was without being asked.
“So… what is this?”
“A life support system.”
“…Yes?”
“Even if someone is at the end of their life, as long as they’re inside here, they can stay alive, hidden from the eyes of the world.”
“I see.”
“Ah, by the way, this is also how the Immortal King was able to live a near-immortal life. In the past, it was possible to extend one’s lifespan using this device. It was lost forever because he didn’t tell us everything before leaving.”
“…”
“You know? I never thought I would use this device. The moment I sat on that throne, which I thought would never change hands, I made a resolution: to be different from that man. To live as a human and die as a human.”
“…That means you’re not going to do that now.”
“Didn’t you see it earlier? The lightning strike that felt like a divine judgment. I’ve been at the end of my lifespan for a long time, and this world is going insane, wanting to eliminate me for defying the natural order.”
“So, that’s why you couldn’t go out and were hiding in here?”
“That’s one way to put it. Why? Does it make me look pathetic?”
“Well, not really. It’s more like a cliche, I guess.”
“Cliche?”
“Yes. No one in this world wants to die, right? Even those who make extreme choices want to live at heart. They just choose to do that because they aren’t living as well as they imagined.”
“Interesting. Continue.”
“Even though you ask, there’s really nothing more to tell. I just wondered how much someone who has everything would want to live.”
Even on Earth, those who reached the pinnacle of power ultimately sought immortality. I didn’t think it was pathetic. As a living creature born to live, why should they be criticized for trying to live?
Well, the inhumane events that happened in the process are beyond reproach.
“Actually, I think that desire in itself is the most human thing.”
“…Curious. It’s not something you’re saying to curry favor.”
“So, are you going to withdraw your decision to keep me imprisoned for a week?”
“Well, that depends on your answer later.”
“Then tell me straight. We’re both people who value every day, aren’t we?”
Seeing me becoming more and more comfortable with the conversation, the Overlord stared at me for a moment.
Fortunately, he didn’t seem to dislike my audacious attitude, and soon his lips curled up again.
“It’s been a long time. Someone appeared who I wanted to talk to again, and it’s you, no less.”
“…”
It sounds like a compliment…
‘…Why does his gaze feel so sinister?’
Whether I got chills down my spine or not, the Overlord continued without a care.
“From now on, you can leave the royal palace and act freely. Save those who should die or kill those who should live, do whatever you want.”
Of course, it wasn’t free.
“What do I have to do in return?”
I asked about the conditions before signing the contract. The Overlord replied with a single word.
“Kill the Prime Minister.”
Because I had heard all the things he said before, the condition itself wasn’t surprising. I simply nodded, thinking ‘so that’s it.’
‘He could do it himself, why ask me…‘
There must be something dirty hidden in there.
