## Outsider (3)
Of course, Baekho had his own team. 
And I knew them pretty well, given that Misha had once been a member before I returned.
“Ah! Baron Yandell! By the way, how is Miss Carlstain doing? Such a kind beast-kin! She was a little cold towards us, though!” 
It was Rex Aures, the former Noark gatekeeper. 
He was a tank like me, and we had some connection beyond just encountering each other once in the past. 
He was the one who ate the 'Abyssal Giant' Essence Baekho took from me during my time undercover as Rihon Shweitz. 
And…
'The Annihilator.'
Belveb Ruinzenes. 
The first mage to join Baekho's team and someone I would have to repay someday.
My hand instinctively grasped Erwen's wrist, fearing she might act rashly. 
It was natural, considering…
“That man… he… my sister…”
Erwen's sister, Daria, was dead. 
She died protecting Erwen from a spell The Annihilator had cast on her.
“It's not time yet. Don't act rashly.”
I muttered, releasing her wrist. Erwen took a step back after a brief pause. 
To regain her composure after seeing the man who was essentially her sworn enemy… 
“Hmm, impressive. To lose your light so completely in this time.”
The Annihilator, who had been observing Erwen from afar, muttered something incomprehensible.
“Perhaps there’s someone with a greater destiny around you?”
His muttering was unsettling, like a cult fanatic standing before me.
Shifting my gaze, I saw two figures.
‘That must be the archer Misha mentioned… based on his appearance.’
The other was completely covered in a robe. 
Judging by his physique, he was a man, but… 
Regardless, he seemed to be the new teammate Baekho had mentioned, someone who shouldn’t be revealed to the outside world yet.
‘Based on their combination, it’s likely he’s a healer…’
It wasn’t something to worry about right now. 
Thankfully, the guy seemed to have come to his senses.
“Ahem, ahem! It’s been a while, Baron Yandell!”
The awkward “Baron” made my ears prickle, but I understood. 
We weren’t alone here. 
My stillness was simply a reflection of the time needed to gather my thoughts. 
However, the reactions of his companions were rather intriguing.
“…Baekho, what’s gotten into you?”
The gatekeeper questioned directly, while the archer looked genuinely surprised.
“You… are capable of using that kind of tone…?”
How arrogant had he been living his life to react like this to a touch of respect? 
It was ridiculous, but recalling his past self made sense. 
Or maybe it didn’t?
“Ah, and you too! You’re, what, Emily Raines now?”
“….”
“It’s strange, really. Nyong-i and you… why do my teammates all go towards Baron Yandell? Seems like there’s a lack of morals, right?”
Morals? Please. 
Misha was my teammate in the first place. 
Apparently, Amelia wasn’t a teammate either, but a spy infiltrating due to a mission.
“Mr. Yandell, be careful. Baekho is a very dangerous person.”
Versil advised me with a tiny voice as we maintained our standoff. 
Did he hear that from that distance?
“Huh? You know me? I don’t think we’ve met.”
“…We haven’t.”
“Why are you saying such bad things?”
“….”
“Oh, tsk… that’s why preconceptions are scary. You judge someone you’ve never met…”
Versil avoided eye contact and didn’t respond to Baekho’s rude words. 
Clearly, he was terrified. 
“What, am I going to kill you? Cheer up —”
“Enough.”
As a leader of a group, I couldn’t stand idly by and intervened. 
The sudden encounter was confusing, but I had to confirm things first.
“Baekho.”
“Yes, speak.”
“Are you… following us?”
What were Baekho’s intentions? 
We were outnumbered and outmatched, so this was the first thing I had to verify. 
If we had brought all our clan members with us, we might regret it.
“Following us? That’s a little egotistical, don’t you think?”
“Then it’s just a coincidence?”
“Yes. It’s a big surprise for me, too. Why would Baron Yandell be here? In such a secluded place, with no witnesses or anyone to help?”
“….”
Though his words sounded almost like a joke, they were ultimately a detail to gain dominance in our conversation. 
I ignored it and judged based on the given information. 
Honestly, it was a high possibility that it was truly a coincidence, judging by the situation.
So, the second question.
“What about you? Why did you come to this secluded place?”
Why did this guy come here?
Baekho’s response was something I couldn’t have imagined.
“I was going to the convenience store.”
…Huh?
“…What?”
“Ah! Right. Baron Yandell probably doesn’t know what a convenience store is! My mistake! My mistake!”
Is this guy really crazy? 
Baekho, seeing my serious expression, continued awkwardly.
“Just kidding… I guess it’s probably the same reason, right?”
“The same reason…?”
“Huh? You’re not here to go out, Baron?”
Yes, you came here for this, too. 
“But I’m a little curious. Why are you suddenly going out, Baron? Can’t you just tell me? I’ll keep it a secret. Okay?”
Perhaps it was because we weren’t alone? 
Talking to him was tiring today. 
He always did what he wanted, without considering others, but I couldn’t.
“Enough with the jokes. If it’s truly a coincidence, then pass by first.”
“Hmm… okay.”
Baekho then led his companions away from the door and entered Noark through the side door. 
And…
“But is she up to it?”
He asked me nonchalantly as he passed by. 
I remained silent, not knowing what he meant, nor who he was referring to. Baekho chuckled.
“What? Was this the first time for you? I knew it…”
…Knew it?
His words left a bad taste, but I didn’t want to talk to him anymore.
“…Just get out of here.”
“Okay. Have fun!”
…Could there be anyone more annoying in the world?
***
Baekho didn’t warn me not to follow him, nor did he do anything like that.
He walked straight ahead, as if it didn’t matter, and from this, I could confirm that what was written in the letter he sent me in Korean was not a lie. 
Honestly, I had my doubts.
That’s why I double-checked by asking Amelia to look into it…
‘Amelia said the place was the square, too.’
The place where Baekho’s team stopped was indeed the square where they had been heading.
“They stopped.”
The square of Noark, once bustling with raiders.
Flash!
A brief flash of light erupted, and Amelia and Erwen simultaneously lost their sense of them.
“…They’re gone.”
We hurried towards the square. 
Erwen quickly scanned the empty square and asked Versil.
“That was… magic, wasn’t it?”
“Yes. It’s a multi-instantaneous teleportation spell. The magic residue tells me it’s below… the magic circle hidden below this square… activated it.”
“Don’t worry. I know the activation spell.”
“Huh? You know it?”
How?
Seeing Versil’s questioning eyes, I awkwardly smiled.
“You’re a noble. There’s a way to find out everything.”
“Oh… yeah.”
I couldn’t honestly tell him I heard it from Baekho.
“Well, then, let’s begin.”
I stood in the middle of the square and gathered my companions nearby, just in case. 
Slowly, I chanted the activation spell.
Actually, it was more like a poem, so I was a little embarrassed to be chanting it alone…
What could I do? 
It was just the old mage’s style.
“My body is made of iron. My blood is steel, and my heart is glass… ”
But I still had questions. 
Why did the spell involve iron?
It was incomprehensible, but I chanted the spell clearly. 
And…
“…His body is certainly made of iron.”
I finished chanting the spell, pushing aside my embarrassment. 
Flash!
But there was no sound or burst of light.
“…?”
“…?”
My companions looked at me, filled with questions.
Actually, I was the most confused.
‘What? Why isn’t anything happening?’
I didn’t take long to understand the situation.
No, I realized…
[What? Was this the first time for you? I knew it…]
What Baekho said earlier, which I hadn’t heard.
‘I knew it, he wouldn’t get angry…’
…I’ve been tricked.
***
The moment I realized I’d been tricked, a fierce rage rose from the depths of my heart.
But, even though I was furious, there was nothing I could do.
“Uh… I guess it was some wrong information! It happens.”
“…Don’t beat yourself up too much. Even nobles don’t always get the right information.”
“….”
It didn’t matter how my companions comforted me. 
I quickly regained my composure and searched for a solution.
“Versil, maybe you —”
“It’s impossible right now. These ancient magic circles require many conditions to activate.”
“How long do you think it will take?”
“…I don’t have any knowledge in this field. I have no idea. Even how long it will take.”
This damn Baekho bastard.
[But is she up to it?]
Now I know who he was talking about earlier, when he was testing me. 
Versil seems to have figured it out, too.
“It’s been a… frustrating day.”
He said he was frustrated, but his voice conveyed more resignation than anger. 
I understood how he felt. 
Realistically, only a few people in an age could become top-tier mages like The Annihilator.
‘…This is something I have to overcome alone.’
I had been through the same thing with Lothmiller. 
This kind of emotion, regardless of what anyone said, could only be overcome by yourself.
“…Can I look around a little by myself?”
“Go ahead. We’ll stay far away.”
“Yes. Thank you.”
Following Versil’s request, we moved aside, and in the remaining time, we took a big stroll through Noark.
Versil wasn’t the only one with a troubled mind. 
He was actually worse.
“…Erwen.”
“Yes?”
“Are you okay?”
“…Yes, I’m okay. It’s just not the right time yet. Not yet.”
Why couldn’t I feel reassured even with her forced smile?
Amelia, silently walking beside me, seemed to share the same thought. She brought up a new topic.
“Speaking of which, Yandell, I was curious about this since before… What’s a convenience store?”
“Oh, that…?”
Knowing it was her intention to change the mood, I tried to answer with a bright voice.
And how much time had passed?
“…It’s kind of nice, being on a trip.”
Thankfully, Erwen seemed to have cheered up a bit.
It was difficult to understand her sentiment of calling a dark underground city without natural light a trip.
“Come to think of it, the place we reunited with you was here too…”
“Yes, I was surprised back then. Did you know?”
“…I’m sorry. I was too preoccupied back then.”
“It’s not like I’m blaming you, so no need to apologize.”
Anyway, when we returned to the square, Versil was still diligently examining the floor. 
“Why don’t we take a break? We can stay here a few more days. We came with plenty of time to spare.”
“Oh… yes.”
“…Did you find anything?”
I asked cautiously. Versil remained silent for a while, then answered with a voice as soft as an ant crawling.
“………Yes.”
“Oh, so you found something. That’s good—”
“I wouldn’t be able to find anything even if you gave me a few years.”
Oh…
I was speechless for a moment, but his subsequent words reassured me. He didn’t seem to have lost it completely.
“It’s only natural. I’ve never properly studied this field. All I’ve ever done is practice combat magic.”
Hearing his explanation, it was more than just a rationalization.
It was more accurate to say he had simply accepted reality. 
“So, I’m just giving up. Don’t call me spineless.”
“I never thought about it in the first place.”
“It’s embarrassing, but what can I do. I’m sorry. I think we need a much more skilled and specialized mage to investigate further than me.”
A specialized mage…
“Do you have anyone to recommend?”
“I do. If it’s that person, we might be able to shorten the time even more than The Annihilator.”
“More than The Annihilator? Who is it?”
I tilted my head and asked. An unexpected name came from Versil’s lips.
“Yurben Havelinon.”
Yurben Havelinon.
“He’s known as the Magitechnician, the head of a school of magic, and an idol to all manufacturing mages.”
Versil’s explanation was accurate, but there was one crucial piece of information missing.
Yurben Havelinon.
GM of ‘Ghostbusters’, the Evil Spirit community.
‘…Maybe it wouldn’t be bad to meet him this time.’
