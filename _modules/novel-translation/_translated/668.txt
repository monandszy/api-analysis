## Chapter 668: The New World (Part 3)
Beyond the city walls, where not even a single hair could be found, save for our own, a human presence was detected. 
"It seems to be just one person, and surprisingly, they appear to be asleep," Erwin said.
Ironically, I felt a deeper sense of unease at the prospect of a solitary figure. It seemed even more illogical than encountering a group. How could anyone be alone in this perilous land, teeming with third-tier monsters?
“We should… check it out,” I suggested.
“Yes, it’s always best to account for all variables,” Misha agreed.
With a swift exchange of opinions, Baekho and the archer dashed off. 
“I’ll go first, you guys can catch up,” Baekho barked.
He launched himself forward like a cannonball. Did this guy even have an ounce of fear? If it were me, I would have approached cautiously, discreetly, and with the rest of our team. 
That unyielding confidence… it might be Baekho’s greatest weakness.
“Baekho?!” Ainar’s voice echoed in the air.
"Aures, let's hurry,” Erwin urged. "It’s unlikely he’ll be in danger, but it’s always better to be safe.”
The rest of us quickly followed Baekho, rushing towards the source of the human presence.
After a short while, we heard a man's desperate plea.
"W-who are you? Please, have mercy! Don't hurt me!"
The voice was coming from directly below.
"It’s down there,” Raven said.
We peered into a fissure in the ground that appeared to have split open like an earthquake. Baekho’s voice rose from the depths.
“Ah, everyone’s here? I’ll go, you guys wait. It’s too narrow for all of us to fit.”
After a brief wait, Baekho’s head popped out from below the cliff. From our vantage point, the space below was obscured, but it seemed to be hidden within the cliff…
“Heave ho!”
Baekho leapt up with a resounding thud, landing on solid ground.  In his right hand, held high like a trophy, a middle-aged man struggled in vain. The man’s appearance was decidedly unkempt, as if he hadn't washed in months.
“Wh-what?! You… let go! Let me go—!”
The man, flailing wildly at Baekho’s grasp, froze, his eyes widening as they landed on someone in particular.
“Aures? Is that you, Aures? It’s really you, Aures!!!”
“You are…”
Wait, did they know each other?
“Who are you?” I inquired.
“It’s me! I’m the third squad leader of Noirarc’s direct guard, Red Eye!”
"Red Eye? Never heard of that moniker…"
Aures’ brows furrowed, and Baekho narrowed his eyes, his grip on the man’s collar loosening slightly.
“Oh, you’re just throwing out a random name and claiming to know her?”
“No, no! You know me! Red Eye! Red Eye, Daelan!”
The man hurriedly added his full name, and Aures seemed to recall something. 
“Daelan? Daelan… that’s the name of the old man who owns the Merun tavern. Ah, you must be his son, right?”
"Yes, that's me!"
“Ah, I remember him now! Haha, good to see you again!"
The two finally recognized each other. Baekho, seemingly deflated by this revelation, dropped the man like a sack of potatoes. However, he hadn’t completely lost interest.
“Daelan, right?”
"Yes, yes…! That’s me!"
"Tell me, what were you doing here all alone?”
“Well…," the man stammered.
"Tell the truth, or you're dead," Baekho warned.
That intimidating tone was one of Baekho’s most frightening aspects.  He always demanded answers with force, disregarding any semblance of justice. And he had an uncanny ability to detect lies.
“I… I deserted!"
"Deserted?" I questioned.
"The plan to invade Rafdonia seemed utterly preposterous to me. People like us would be thrown into the fray and die pointlessly."
"Hee… so you slipped away when everyone else was returning.”
"I wasn’t the only one! Initially, many others thought the same as me."
"Yeah? But why are you alone now?”
"Well… we were scattered because of the monsters…"
The man explained that over a hundred people had initially stayed behind, believing they could live happily ever after. 
Their promise of unity shattered the moment they encountered powerful monsters.  No wonder, they had only been looking out for themselves when they fled the group in the first place. 
“So, after we scattered, I searched for a safe place to hide, and eventually settled here…," he explained.
"In that rabbit hole of a cave below the cliff?”
“Yes.”
“How long have you been living there?”
"I don’t know the exact time, but it's been about two months…"
“Wow, that’s pretty impressive.  But where did you go to the bathroom?” Baekho asked, snickering.
"Well… I actually… went to the edge of the cliff and squatted—"
“Stop it! That's disgusting,” Jeina, the healer, interrupted, scowling.
Baekho, despite the reprimand, let out a chuckle and didn’t continue the conversation. 
Seizing the opportunity, the man boldly posed a question to Baekho.
"But... who are you, sir?"
“Me? Why are you curious?"
“W-well… I was wondering… since you’re from the city, you might know… whether the Lord’s plan was successful…”
Was he finally regretting his decision to not follow the group? If he found out that the man was from the city, he would probably beg to be taken back. Of course, Baekho would never grant such a request.
"That’s none of your business, be quiet," Baekho said, dismissing him.
“…”
"Hm, what should I do with this guy? He’ll probably die soon anyway…"
The man’s face paled at those words.  It wasn't entirely surprising.  Baekho was acting as if he were contemplating what to have for dinner, sending shivers down my spine.
"Wait, please! I have a proposal to make!”
"Huh?"
"Please take me back to the city! I’ll offer you valuable information in exchange!”
The man’s plea was desperate, though Baekho remained unimpressed.
“Hm, I’m not really interested…"
His voice seemed genuinely uncaring, but I knew it was an act. Or perhaps a natural negotiation tactic. It was Baekho’s habit to take the lead when the other party showed deference.
"Well, tell me anyway. If it’s truly valuable, I’ll consider it."
Baekho, firmly in the position of dominance, remained unyielding, and the man began to spill a secret we never could have anticipated. 
"Dimensional Stone…! I know where another Dimensional Stone is…!"
Hmm…? 
*** 
The man’s story was short and concise. While searching for a safe place to hide after separating from the group, he stumbled upon something. 
A Dimensional Stone, identical to the one in Noirarc.
"What… it’s real?”
Baekho, with his lie detector, confirmed the stone’s authenticity.
"It was hidden in a dangerous place, a place no ordinary person would dare to venture. No one but me would have found it!"
Indeed, coming from someone who lived in a cave beneath the cliff, it seemed plausible that the stone was hidden in a truly extraordinary location.
"So, where is it?"
Baekho’s nonchalant facade completely crumbled, his interest piqued. The man, sensing his change in attitude, quickly seized the opportunity.
“It’s not hard to tell you… but…," he started.
"Fine, you want a promise? I promise. If you behave yourself and follow us, I’ll take you back to the city," Baekho said.
The man, carefully studying Baekho’s face for any sign of deceit, eventually nodded.
“I trust you…"
“Alright, done.  Now, tell me where it is.”
Baekho's question prompted the man to approach the edge of the cliff where his hiding place was located.
“It’s right below this spot," he said.
"Down here?”
“Yes…," the man confirmed.
Ha, no wonder he was so eager to tell us.  He knew we would easily discover the stone if we searched the area, so he wanted to close the deal quickly.
“I’ll go first, you guys can go down after me.  Understood?"
Once again, Baekho, without a moment’s hesitation, leaped off the cliff, and we followed suit, each utilizing our own methods to descend.
Woosh-!
The mage used levitation magic.
Thump, thud, thump-!
The archer, using a series of short leaps.
[Heeeeee-!]
The priest, riding a flying summoned creature.
And me?
"Gotta use my body, I guess.”
Kaboom-!
The landing was a bit rough, sending a jolt of electricity through my feet due to the depth of the ravine, but my diligently cultivated strength and physical resistance stats allowed me to endure the shock.
"Wow, Baron, you're bold!”
“Don’t even. Anyway, is this the Dimensional Stone?”
"Yes. Looks like it really was there. But we’ll have to ask Grandpa if we can activate it."
The ravine was a staggering seventy meters deep, a dark, desolate pit where barely any sunlight could penetrate. In the shadows, the Dimensional Stone, as promised, lay exposed.
"Oh, Grandpa!  Over here!  Come and check it out!”
“Habeliion, come and examine it with us.”
Once the mages arrived, they meticulously examined the stone. Both reached the same conclusion.
“It has the exact same properties as the Dimensional Stone we used before."
“If we pour enough mana into it, it will likely open a portal.”
"Wow, really? We couldn’t find it no matter how hard we looked, but we found it here."
Baekho, beaming with pride, clapped the man on the shoulder.  
If he was going to compliment the guy, he should have slapped him harder.  
But it’s all about style, I guess.
"Let’s pour some mana into it and check it out."
“What if it works?” the GM asked, his voice laced with apprehension.
"Well, just do it first. We’ll figure it out later.  Why are you so nervous?"
“…”
The GM, having been reprimanded for his question, approached the stone with a melancholic expression.
"We’ll begin," he said, beginning the activation process alongside the doom mage.
The concentrated mana erupted in a brilliant light, growing larger and taking shape before our eyes.
“It’s really opening a portal,” Raven said, mesmerized.
"Baekho, what do we do now?”
"Hmm, I'll have to think about that.  We really need to plan this next move carefully,” Baekho replied, lost in contemplation.
“Let’s finish this quickly. The portal can only stay open for about five minutes,” Misha warned.
"Okay."
Baekho, finally emerging from his reverie, spoke up.
"Still, I'm curious where this leads. It feels like a real adventure, for once.”
"Don't forget our purpose. We’re here to get the materials to repair the magic circle.”
"But what if, we take this portal and reach the other side faster?"
"…"
"Well, if it doesn't work, we can just open the portal again and come back.  Right?"
This guy’s P-value is probably through the roof.  His line of thinking is something I can’t even fathom. But I had to agree with him on one point.
“I’m curious too...,” I admitted.
It felt like a real adventure.  For once.
As if he had reached a decision, Baekho spoke up.
"Alright, I’m done thinking."
"What’s the verdict?"
"Let’s go through it.  It’ll be more trouble getting back here later. Baron, you alright with this?”
Hmm…
"What if I say no? Will you still go through?"
"No. We’re going through as a team, you stay here, Baron."
"I’ll go with you.”
It might be a hidden opportunity, but I couldn’t leave Baekho alone.  Once I reached my decision, things moved quickly.
"Hey, you go first."
“M-me?"
"Any reason why you can’t go?"
“But… what if something dangerous is on the other side? Ah, I’ll go first.”
“About time."
Baekho sent the man through the portal first, and each of us followed in turn. It was my turn last...
Flash-!
My vision blurred white, slowly returning. As usual, I scanned my surroundings. 
The terrain was a dark cave. No monsters were in sight.  But the problem was…
"Baekho? Did we get here properly? I can’t see the Dimensional Stone anywhere.”
The portal vanished the moment we arrived, and there was no sign of the stone that would allow us to reopen it.  
And…
“One, two, three, four, five…," I counted, noticing something amiss.
Someone was missing.
More precisely…
“What the hell, that guy,” Baekho muttered.
The man who had told us about the stone’s location was nowhere to be found.
"He really just vanished? We didn't give him enough time to escape!  What the hell, that guy?"
Baekho’s voice echoed with confusion.  I swallowed, a shiver running down my spine.
This felt like a trap.  A deep sense of unease washed over me.  
"Aures."
"Why do you call me?"
"That guy, remember? Daelan."
"Yes?"
"Daelan is his last name… what's his first name?”
It was an odd question for Aures.  But she thought for a moment before responding.
“Well… I don’t remember very well.”
“…”
A disappointing answer, but perhaps it was better not to know.
“I think it’s better not to know."
As I dismissed my thoughts, Aures spoke up.
“However…”
"However?" I asked, intrigued.
"It seems to be a very common name."
…Come on, it can’t be.
