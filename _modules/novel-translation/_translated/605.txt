## Chapter 605: Legion Commander (2)
Silence in a gathering of many people always has a reason. Everyone might be focused on something. Perhaps there's a somber atmosphere for mourning. Or perhaps they're stunned to the point of being speechless. 
“…! ”
“…! ”
This silence was the latter. Everyone in the command staff was visibly taken aback by my actions and words. However, they didn't utter a word, their gazes fixed on one particular person.
“...”
Zillen Evost. The lawful successor to the command, our exploration force’s vice-commander in the commander’s absence. Truthfully, I hold this man in high regard. Even with an unknown monstrosity inhabiting the body of Commander Jerome Saintred, this exploration force functioned flawlessly. He was the lubricant and engine of this force.
‘Perhaps he planned to announce his succession right after this meeting.’
The plan would have undoubtedly proceeded without any opposition if not for my sudden intrusion.
“...”
Everyone was waiting for his response, but the vice-commander remained silent. He seemed to be calmly collecting his thoughts.
‘I shouldn’t give him too much time.’
I looked at the vice-commander and spoke again.
“You don’t understand what this is all about, do you?”
My voice, laced with a hint of provocation, finally elicited a response.
“I do understand, my lord. I comprehend precisely why you took that seat and am contemplating how to convince you.”
“Convince, you say… You mean to say you don't accept me sitting here?”
My question, even more provocative than the previous one, caused all the command staff to widen their eyes.
‘What kind of insolence is this? You barbarian?’
They probably wanted to yell that, but they seemed hesitant due to my title and reputation. This applied to my comrades as well, unfortunately. 
“...”
Even Amelia, who I considered my right hand, stood far away, eyes questioning, ‘Is this man truly insane?’
“Naturally.”
The vice-commander responded to my question.
“You are not qualified to be the commander of this exploration force, my lord.”
“Why not?”
“You are merely the temporary leader of the fourth unit.”
Temporary leader of the fourth unit, not even the leader of a formally recognized unit.
“According to the military law established by the royal family, if the highest-ranking person dies or becomes incapable of performing their duty, the next highest ranking person assumes their responsibilities.”
The vice-commander then appealed to military law, invoking the name of the royal family. 
As if I didn’t know that?
“Then there's no issue, is there? The next highest ranking person after the count is me, a baron.”
The exploration force was a gathering of elites, but only the count and I held titles. Why would a titled nobleman descend into the maze, especially to the first floor, where even proper exploration was incomplete? Even the original Count Saintred was reluctantly dragged here because someone needed to take the role of overall commander.
“My lord, you need to understand the difference between rank and title.”
The vice-commander sighed, looking at me. His response was far calmer than expected. I would have already picked up a hammer and rejected his nonsense if I were him. 
“Rank, title, it all boils down to status, doesn’t it? Out of everyone here, I have the highest status after the count.”
I pushed my point further, but the vice-commander explained, as calmly as before. He elaborated on the difference between rank and title, spoke about combat tactics, the political issues my stubbornness could cause, and even lectured extensively on military law. However…
“So?”
“Excuse me?”
“So, why can’t I do it?”
Even the wisest of sages would feel a sense of self-deprecation when preaching to a deaf ear. 
“...”
The vice-commander, who had been trying to persuade me for a long time, finally clamped his mouth shut, realizing he couldn’t convince me.
“Zillen Evost.”
I spoke, seizing the moment. It might seem a bit ridiculous for a barbarian who had just established his family to speak this way, but…
“I have no intention of following the orders of someone without a title.”
I had almost completely gauged the vice-commander. This approach would work better with him.
“And to begin with.”
I spoke again.
“Can you give me orders?”
“...”
“Can you truly treat me like your other subordinates?”
The vice-commander didn’t reply.  His integrity and honesty, refusing to say anything, even as a mere formality, were quite impressive, but such traits were not suitable for someone aiming for the commander’s role. Perhaps if he were an advisor, but not as a commander.
“...”
“...”
The vice-commander’s continued silence. Finally, I tore my gaze from him and looked around. 
Surprisingly, their faces held no fear or anxiety. They were simply holding their breaths, curious about how this would end.
‘It’s not like they care who sits in the commander’s seat, right?’
From the vice-commander’s perspective, it was a forced justification, but for them, it probably wasn’t as forced. A baron with a title recognized by the royal family. The weight of that fact in the city of Raphdonia was immense.
Well, even so, the real reason for their reaction would be something else.
“Everyone, listen up.”
I abandoned the playful tone, speaking to everyone, sensing the right moment.
“We are at a crossroads.”
The crossroads weren’t about choosing a commander. 
“We can either fulfill the mission entrusted to us by the royal family and return gloriously to the city, or we can be trapped here forever.”
The longer we spent here, the more they would have thought this, but they had never shown it. I made them acknowledge it before continuing.
“But if you trust me and follow me…”
I didn’t need to say much more.
“I will surely return you all home.”
I had already proven myself with my actions. In the Crystal Cave where the abyssal lord appeared, in the Goblin Forest, in the Ice Rock expedition. And here on the first floor. I was the one who fought most fiercely against the Rank 1 monsters on Library Island. I was also the one who broke through all the guardian statues and opened the rift, and the one who actually entered the rift. What did the vice-commander do? He kept the exploration force in good shape, but that was all. 
Therefore…
‘How long will we be trapped here?’
The members, starting to feel such anxiety, would clearly know who to view as the ‘reliable commander.’
“Everyone, including me, knows that the baron is a smart person. What do you want, my lord? How can we convince you?”
The vice-commander asked bluntly, and I replied with a smirk.
“Let’s have all the members vote.”
Democratic procedures are always right. 
***
The vote. A democratic process that never fit with the hierarchical structure of the military. But the vice-commander readily accepted it.
‘He probably judged that a vote was the only way to stop my stubbornness.’
He would have been confident, of course. Even without a title, he was a member of a noble family and a respected superior to the knights.
‘Fifty-fifty, maybe…?’
His subordinates would all vote for him. On the other hand, our temporary fourth unit would vote for me. Both sides had similar numbers, so there would be no clear superiority.
Therefore, what mattered was the overall sentiment of the exploration force members…
“The results are in.”
The results of the vote among all the exploration force members were announced.
“It was a close one.”
I won with a slight majority of votes. Everyone probably thought that a strong leader was needed to escape this layer…
This was fortunate for both me and the vice-commander.  I didn't have to use Plan B in case I lost.
“Well, with the results in…”
I naturally took the commander’s seat and issued my first order.
“Zillen Evost, you are the vice-commander. You’ll be doing the same things as before, so I’m sure you’ll do well.”
“Yes.”
A formal order to show the hierarchy to everyone. After that, I led the meeting smoothly.
“It seems we’re only just getting to talking about the rift now.”
Finally, I spoke about what happened within the rift. I didn’t give a detailed account, focusing on the ‘archbishop’s’ end, the main thing everyone was curious about.
“He… really became a priest of Karui?”
“Wait a minute, does that mean the count’s death was because of the archbishop?”
The religious figures participating in the command staff meeting couldn’t hide their agitation. The archbishop’s end was an end, but the real reason for their unease was that the mastermind behind the commander’s death was the archbishop. However…
“Don’t worry, I won’t hold the Samsin Church responsible for this. It was a natural disaster. It was such a dangerous mission, and the archbishop just happened to die in the process.”
I calmed their anxiety, worried about potential repercussions.
“And if Count Saintred were truly dead, then it would be different. But he’s not, right? Nothing bad will happen because of this when we return to the city.”
“That’s a relief, but…”
These aren't ordinary priests. They are all high-ranking figures within the Samsin Church. That’s why they are a bit more worldly, even for priests.
“Anyway, let's get down to business. Vice-commander, are you done investigating the room behind the stone gate?”
“Not the statues, no.”
“I heard you’ve figured out the portal.”
“I need to investigate further, but the majority opinion is that it's a portal to the outside.”
“I see.”
“However, it might be wiser to postpone using the portal.”
“Why?”
“Because it’ll be the rainy season outside.”
I hadn’t calculated the time, but it seems another rainy season was coming outside.
“Then we’ll stay here until the rainy season ends and do some investigations.”
With those words, today’s meeting was over.
“I’m hungry, so everyone go out.”
I finally uttered a line I always wanted to say, and everyone left the barracks like a receding tide. 
Except for one person.
“Vice-commander, do you have something to say to me?”
To be precise, I meant to say that he could speak if he had any complaints.
But the vice-commander chuckled upon hearing my words.
“You know, my lord? I’m one of the people who is truly grateful to have you as our commander.”
“...What?”
It wasn’t a typical flattery, not even from someone trying to curry favor with the new power holder.
“In fact… I voted for you in the election.”
“...Why?”
“Because I know my place. A position where I have to be responsible for hundreds of people is not for me.”
“...You were the one who opposed me the most, though?”
“Well, I need to have an excuse, don’t I? If I don’t, I’ll be socially ostracized when I return to the city, right?”
The vice-commander then gave me a polite salute.
“So please take good care of the exploration force. The better you lead the exploration force, the less responsibility I’ll have, wouldn’t you say?”
The vice-commander had finished his business and left, leaving a pouch of jerky in front of me.
“Ah, because you said you were hungry.”
I had a feeling I had been played, but I put the jerky in my mouth and chewed it.
‘It’s delicious.’
This exploration force is mine now. 
***
(True) Barbarian Legion Commander mode was very convenient. Honestly, it was such a hassle to relay orders through the village chief, who was basically a figurehead. That process is completely gone now.
No, that's not all.
“You mean to say you’re going to reorganize the organization chart?”
“Yeah. It’s clearly inefficient to just divide it into four units and let the unit leaders handle everything.”
I can issue radical orders that the village chief, who had to pretend to be Count Saintred, would never have dared to issue.
“Inefficient… you say?”
“Yeah, you know I’ll be making changes to the command staff members, too.”
“Yes…”
The vice-commander was still a very useful asset. He always thinks about how to carry out my orders, no matter what I tell him. This could be seen as a disadvantage, though. He never speaks up to his superiors.
“You really… took over as commander.”
“Are you jealous that you couldn’t become vice-commander?”
“….I wouldn’t even want it if it was given to me.”
Amelia really needs some sweet talk from time to time.
“Be careful. This might be fine here, but who knows what kind of trouble the royal family might cause us when we return to the city for this whole thing?”
She always has a critical remark to make, no matter what I say. 
Well, that's why I like her. 
“Do you want anything? I can give you anything as a commander’s order…”
“I’m going now.”
“Oh, and find Raven and call her for me!”
“...”
Amelia left without a word, but Raven came into the barracks soon after.
“You called me, commander?”
“Commander, my ass. Have a seat.”
Raven looked at me, seated in the commander’s chair, with a disbelieving expression, then walked quickly over and sat next to me.
“So, what did you call me for? Is it because of the investigation?”
“Not really. It’s about something else, but I’m curious about that too.  I have a favor to ask.”
“Can I just go back like this?”
“Of course not. It’s a commander’s order.”
“Ugh… I should have written Evost’s name on a slip of paper and put it in a box.”
It’s too late to regret now.
This exploration force is mine.
“Tell me. What’s the favor?”
I took out the item I was secretly keeping, looking at Raven, resigned to her fate.
“A wreath? What is this?”
“I don’t know. But it appeared when the village chief killed the archbishop.”
“It wasn’t from a monster?”
“No, that’s why it’s even more suspicious and special.”
Raven picked up the wreath with curious eyes and examined it from every angle.
“It’s not a Numbers item… I’ve never heard of such a wreath. Can I have this? You probably called me here to ask me to investigate this.”
“Yeah, that’s true… but don’t tell anyone about it. You can research it, but do it alone.”
“What? Why?”
“It’s secret research.  No one else can know. You’re the only one who knows about this wreath.”
I’m telling you this because I trust you.
I deliberately added that nuance to my words, as Raven especially likes that.
But…
“The only one who knows, you say…?”
Raven, known for her intelligence and intuition, quickly caught on.
“This… is embezzlement!!”
She quickly pulled her hand away from the wreath, terrified, worried that she might be implicated.
Of course, that wasn’t a big issue.
“Embezzlement, you say? It’s the commander’s decision.”
“Don’t be ridiculous!”
“So, you won’t do it? It’s a mysterious treasure I acquired from the first floor rift?”
“………I didn’t say I wouldn’t.”
Raven, glancing around, quickly stored the wreath in her subspace.
