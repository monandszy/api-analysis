## Chapter 446: The Party (3)
The banquet, which began just after noon, ended before sunset. 
All the attendees were the heads of their respective families, representing their clans. Unlike the carefree nobles, they had mountains of work piled up.
“Once about two hours had passed, people started to leave in droves.”
Most of them, forced to attend by tradition, lingered only long enough to avoid suspicion before departing the palace without a second thought.
Of course, with so many rarely seen clan heads gathered, many seized the opportunity for social interaction. Even they, however, began to leave by nightfall, citing fatigue.
“Is this why they say old people become like children?”
As if they were children in a new country with strict curfews.
Clang, clang.
Watching the royal palace recede from view as I rode in my carriage, various thoughts flitted through my mind.
From trivial musings about how convenient it would be to have a home in the Imperial Capital, to contemplations about my future.
“I never got to have a proper conversation with the Marquess.”
Sadly, my quest for this banquet – to sound out the Marquess – failed. I had approached him, intending to greet him and sit at his table, but there were simply too many people around.  He didn’t seem keen on dismissing the crowd either.
In the end, I had to settle for a perfunctory greeting and leave. It was a frustrating disappointment.
“In truth, now that I think about it, the Marquess’s intentions don’t matter much anymore…”
What matters is balance, moving forward.
Regardless of the Marquess’s feelings towards me, once I grow larger, he’ll be hesitant to provoke me. Therefore, I must navigate this delicately, ensuring I’m formidable enough to deter casual attacks, yet not intimidating enough to warrant a full-fledged assault.
“At any rate, joining Melbes went smoothly…”
The formal joining ceremony would be held on a separate day, but for now, there were no issues. 
However, I still wasn’t sure what would become of Laguna, who had contacted me through a note.  If things went well, she could play the role of a wildcard in the future power struggle with the Marquess.
“Sigh…”
It’s rather disheartening to find myself burdened with these kinds of thoughts. If I had remained the library's librarian, I could have simply reunited with him warmly and happily.
“Why did it have to be the Marquess’s daughter?”
To make matters worse, Hyun-byeol is also involved in this mess. The more I think about it, the more my head spins.
“…Well, I’ll know when I see him.”
As I dozed off, the carriage soon reached the military transport platform. After a brief teleportation trip back to Rabigeon, I boarded another carriage and headed home.
“You’re back early.”
“The banquet ended sooner than expected. Where’s Erwen?”
“She just came in and is showering now.”
Oh, so I can see her today, then.
After showering and changing clothes, I went downstairs to the living room where Amelia and Erwen were deep in conversation.
They seemed surprisingly close. I guess their time together in Ice Rock…
“Uncle!!”
Erwen spotted me and rushed towards me. I extended my hand to stop her.
“Erwen, I’m not your uncle.”
“…Eh?”
Erwen looked at me like a deflated doll.
“I’m Baron Bjorn Yandell!”
As I finished my sentence, Erwen let out an awkward gasp.
“Ah…”
Well, a barbarian’s been put in his place.
She’s not accepting it. Ainar would have cheered and been thrilled.
“Bjorn, stop your nonsense and sit down.”
“…Alright.”
I sat down on the sofa with a sulk. Right away, our family meeting began. We had several things to discuss since we hadn’t met in a while, but the first issue on the agenda was, as expected, Erwen.
“…Thankfully, it’s all sorted out. The Sacred Tree Palace has been returned, and the money we borrowed for buying this house… we agreed to pay it back within a month.”
Erwen spoke as if she had committed a crime. I asked her why she was so apologetic, and she confessed that she felt guilty for not being able to keep the house, which held so many precious memories.
“It’s fine. Why are you apologizing?”
Frankly, I’m still not entirely convinced that the elves would let Erwen go for a measly house. 
Pure bloods are only born once per generation.
I had feared they might even demand her life.
“This outcome is practically the best of the best…”
I questioned her about the details. Everything seemed too convenient. Erwen explained the situation:
“While everyone was arguing with the elders, my uncle stepped in and helped. I think that’s what turned things around.”
Uncle, huh?
Come to think of it, I’d heard that her uncle held a heroic status among the elves. I’d like to meet him sometime.
“Still, a month is quite a tight deadline.”
Amelia brought up the more practical issues once Erwen’s report ended.
“We can pay off the debt by selling this house, but we’ll have to find a new place to live.”
“…Perhaps we should buy this house back? We could afford it if we sell some of our spoils…”
“I don’t know. Bjorn, what do you think?”
“Hm…”
After a moment of deliberation, I gave my opinion.
“I think it’d be better to live in an inn for a while. Or maybe rent a place. Of course, it’ll be much smaller than our current house.”
“…I see. I guess so…”
Erwen seemed reluctant to sell this house, but she didn’t disagree with my suggestion. 
Geez, you can be honest in a place like this.
“Don’t worry too much. This house and the next one are just temporary places we’ll be staying.”
When I mentioned that Melbes would cover the costs of buying land and building a new house, Erwen’s expression brightened noticeably.
“So, we’ll actually have a Yandell Baron’s House…!”
“Yes, so tell me everything you need when we design it. 
“…?”
“It’ll be your house too.”
“!!!!”
Her reaction confirmed that her regret about selling the current house had vanished.
“Of course, Amelia, you too.”
Just in case she felt left out, I mentioned Amelia’s needs as well. For some reason, Amelia sighed at me.
Oh, by the way, she did state her wish, though.
“…I’d like our navigator’s room to be a bit bigger than the current one. With a window that gets sunlight.”
Our navigator seemed quite down lately. 
Maybe some sea breeze will cheer him up?
***
“We’ve settled the housing issue… what about the Labyrinth exploration?”
Amelia brought up the next item on the agenda after the housing matter was resolved.
Of course, our party is still incomplete.
Ainar, Erwen, Amelia, me, and our navigator.
We’re missing one member to complete our six-person party.
The problem is that there’s nobody immediately available to join.
I plan to eventually bring all my expedition team members into my clan, but I’m trying to be cautious because I think moving too hastily could lead to trouble.
If we were to recruit someone right now, it’d be safe to bring in either Rabiyen or Bersil Goul랜드, the mage…
“Bersil said it would take a month to definitively settle his past grievances with the Temple, and Rabiyen said she’d be taking a break from exploring for the time being…”
One way or another, we have a spot open.
It would be a shame to waste a month just resting.
I made my decision.
“I think it’d be better to go in just us this time.”
“Five of us?”
“It’s not really unusual, is it? Five of us were the norm for several years.”
“Well… that’s true.”
“We’re only planning to stay on the sixth floor and not ascend to the seventh, so there shouldn’t be any serious risks.”
“The sixth floor… I see. I’ll tell Rocklob as well.”
So, that settles the Labyrinth exploration issue.
After a light dinner and some casual chatter, I went to sleep.
The next morning, we all went to the Guild branch and finished registering our clan membership.
“He… thank you, Uncle.”
She should have thanked Amelia, who’s right next to her…
Seeing her hold a second copy of the registration paper and treasure it made me feel a pang of guilt.
“Ugh, we still need to fill the Vice-Captain position.”
I had casually broached the topic of Amelia filling that role when we first established the clan, but she flatly refused.
She didn’t want to be in the spotlight?
Well, for one, her current name, ‘Emily Rains’, is a pseudonym.
“So who should I make Vice-Captain…”
It’s a crucial position. 
It’s especially important because by registering a Power of Attorney, the Vice-Captain can handle administrative procedures that require the Captain’s authorization.
“…Raven would have been perfect. She’s meticulous and efficient, handling all those tedious tasks.”
After finishing our clan registration, we went to a nearby restaurant for a quick bite.
“Bjorn, are you going to Commelby now?”
“No, I’m going to the Temple first.”
“…Temple?”
Amelia frowned in confusion for a moment, but she soon understood.
“You’re going to remove the Gachabon Essence.”
“There’s no need to hide anymore.”
I said that, but in truth, I had been agonizing over this decision until today.
The Gachabon Essence is a decent essence, after all.
I thought it’d be better to keep it until we started farming the next essence for real.
However…
“There must be more to it.”
“Of course. I recently got my old equipment back from Ainar and Avman, and I can use it again with my original physique. It’d be a waste not to use it. Plus, I might find a better essence while exploring the sixth floor. I also need to visit my tribe sometime, and I definitely don’t want to go in this body.”
“Hm…?”
Amelia let out a curious snort, while Erwen expressed her disappointment.
“Oh… so you’re going back to your old size…?”
“Yes.”
“I like the way you are now…”
What an incomprehensible sense of aesthetics. I don’t get why she likes this skinny body.
“I’ll be back later.”
After arriving at the Temple, I entered alone and underwent the essence removal process.
「The [Gachabon Essence] infused into your character’s soul has been removed.」
「Your Sixth Sense has decreased by -40.」
「Your Physical Resistance has decreased by -15.」
「Your Darkness Resistance has decreased by -30.」
「Your Accuracy has decreased by -45… 」
Decreasing stats.
「Your Bone Density has decreased by -110.」
Increased height.
「Your Control has increased by +30.」
My mind feels sharper.
「Your Luck has increased by +50.」
My most crucial stat, luck, should be slightly better now.
Whoosh.
After a moment to adjust to my changed height, I pulled out the clothes I brought and looked at myself in the mirror.
“Ugh, I’m finally back to my original body.”
It’s almost surreal, but I really am huge.
I had the urge to shout out my ancestral deity’s name, but I managed to suppress it with superhuman control.
This is the Temple, after all.

The two of them reacted in stark contrast to my changed appearance.
“He, Uncle! You look amazing on this side too! Just like the first time we met!”
Erwen, who had been disappointed, showered me with praise as if she had never thought such a thing.
“…Definitely prefer the previous one.”
Amelia, on the other hand, didn’t say a word. She hammered a nail right into a warrior’s heart.
With a peculiar murmur, she said, “But… from a certain perspective, this side might be better.”
“Huh? What are you talking about?”
“I mean, you’re better off being ugly.”
“I’m not ugly, I’m just manly.”
“Pfft…”
“…You just laughed at me, didn’t you?”
“Home education.”
The phrase swelled up in my throat, but I managed to swallow it down. 
She’s a valuable teammate after all. 
Plus, this girl really didn’t have proper home education.
As clan leader, I should let this slide.
“…If I hadn’t regained my Control, it might have been dangerous.”
Anyways, I headed to Commelby as planned. 
Not all of our expedition team members live in the seventh district. We had agreed to meet in Commelby, the heart of the city.
“This is it.”
As we entered the building Bersil had booked for the day, familiar faces appeared one after another.
“Huf, you’re finally here. Yandell Junior Baron… No, I suppose it’s Baron now.”
Meland Kaislan.
“…My, you’ve changed.”
Lis 마ro*ne*, James Kala, Sven Parab, etc.
Our team members, who had survived the bitter cold and hunger of Ice Rock together, gathered around in awe of my changed appearance.
“Bersil. Where are Akulaba and Rabiyen?”
“They said they couldn’t come because of personal reasons.”
“Still, everyone else is here.”
“They were all quite curious, I’m sure.”
Well, I was curious, and I’m sure they were even more so.
“How’s the perimeter?”
“Don’t worry about surveillance. I deliberately chose a place without windows, and the Sound Control magic is active. Just in case, I also have the Magic Detection spell running in real-time.”
…This mage definitely knows his stuff.
I’ll have to casually ask him if he’s interested in the Vice-Captain position when he joins the clan.
“Yandell Baron!”
“Baron, my ass. Just call me Captain.”
We reunited, happily sharing stories about what we had been up to.
And then, the time came.
“Um… but when are we doing that?”
The opening ceremony for the extradimensional space we looted from the Rose Knights.
“We opened it and found nothing but the backpacks we’d put in, so we assumed that’s all there was.”
That’s what I thought too.
But I recently learned that was wrong. There were hidden items, and we needed to adjust the extradimensional space’s magic formula to retrieve them?
Apparently, this discovery was made by Bersil, the mage…
“Alright, come one by one. I’ve prepared plenty of reagents.”
I was a little nervous, as I haven’t mastered the magic formula adjustment yet.
“I wonder… what’s inside?”
“I was a bit disappointed at first, but now I’m even more excited.”
“Ugh… everyone else must have opened theirs already. I was too worried about having surveillance nearby to even think about opening it.”
What exactly was so important that they needed double security to keep it hidden?
I don’t know. 
That’s why I decided to remove the Gachabon Essence today, even though I could have waited a bit longer.
“Well… now that we’re done…?”
“Alright, let’s open it!”
I hope we get a bit of luck today.
