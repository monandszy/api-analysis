## The Expedition (3)
To put it simply, the speedrun was a failure. When we arrived at our destination, the portal connected to the second floor was already open, meaning we wouldn't be the first to claim credit for its discovery.  Darn it, I thought this time would be different.
"How far behind are we from the front team?"
"About ten minutes."
Ten minutes? Seriously? Even our arrival time would have been enough to complete a speedrun in the game. The overall level of players seems to have increased.
'Still, ten minutes… I just need to increase my movement speed a little more and it should be possible.'
A stable speedrun would allow us to accumulate free experience with each expedition, making it crucial for efficient leveling. That dragonkin woman likely requested our involvement for the same reason.
'I wonder if Ravien succeeded in her speedrun?'
Ravien, the last member of our team, the dragonkin. She left after attending the founding ceremony, skipping the banquet altogether and entering the Labyrinth independently. She claimed moving alone would be faster and that we'd meet on the sixth floor anyway.  
'If it weren't for the Viscount back then……' 
That was a questionable way of thinking, a sure sign of a troubled mind. I felt the need to correct her, but the Viscount's intervention unfortunately prevented it. He argued that we should grant her some freedom since she had a personal agreement with him. I agreed to allow her to operate independently, but also pleaded that we should avoid any kind of forceful control. In other words, don't just beat her up. 
'It's not like we're adding a princess to our team.' 
Of course, the fact that an easy and convenient method was blocked doesn't mean I'm giving up on controlling her. I need to straighten her out for our future convenience.  
Any way I can.
“Entering the Goblin Forest on the second floor.”
“Entering the Pilgrim’s Path on the third floor.”
“Entering the Sky Tower on the fourth floor……”
Regardless of that woman, our expedition progressed smoothly as planned. We quickly made our way to the fourth floor. Since combat avoidance was impossible there, we practiced together, enhancing our mutual understanding. As a result, we naturally ended up talking more often.
"Hmm, so it's true that the three of you live together."
We shared personal stories during our conversations, but nobody crossed the line. For example, nobody asked if the rumors about Erwin and me were true, or inquired about my relationship with the Viscount. Nobody asked why people like us weren't known until now.  Old Man Diddy occasionally expressed curiosity about these things, but Magician Ashid would cut him off before he could say anything.
"But, by any chance—"
"Mr. Rains, while observing the fight, a question came to mind. Can your duplicates use Aura?"
"No, it's impossible."
"Is that so? It seems other abilities can be used by duplicates. This rare essence is making me so eager to learn more."
At first, I thought it was a coincidence. But now I’m certain. This magician deliberately changes the topic whenever Old Man Diddy tries to ask anything uncomfortable.
'He's a truly smart man.'
I don't know why, but maybe it's because he's a male magician? Whenever I see Riard Ashid, I always think of Dwarki. Of course, unlike that guy, Ashid speaks his mind with a gentle voice and his social skills are far superior.
Perhaps it’s just a difference in temperament. He's quick-witted and much more mature. But, that’s exactly why…
"Why are you looking at me like that, Mr. Shuitz?"
"Nothing."
Whenever I look at him, that thought keeps popping up in my mind.
Rioll Werb Dwarki. If he also grew up with time, would he have given me this same feeling?

“Entering the Great Sea on the sixth floor.”

Eighteen days into the Labyrinth. 
We arrived at Raimia, the starting island, after rushing through the Labyrinth, skipping all floors except the fourth. It was incredibly tranquil.  
That's only natural. We just arrived after rushing here, so how many others would have reached this point at this time?  
The military reconnaissance team consisting of the fastest individuals.
The elite of a large clan awaiting their main force.
And…
“….” 
Other teams from our expedition, who only sent a brief wave from afar, mindful of the other people's gazes.  
Wow, there are two teams who arrived before us.  The Dwarf woman's team was expected, as they are composed of veteran explorers. But, I never thought the fourth team, led by the paladin Jun, would be faster than us.
"… Ah, there you are."
In any case, it was easy to find one specific person thanks to the peace and quiet.  The dragonkin Ravien. The woman we included in the team through a deal with the Viscount, a business colleague whose full name I haven't even heard yet.
"You guys can rest here for now."
I asked my team members to wait, then approached the woman who was sitting on a chair in the shade, staring blankly at the beach.
"Eighteen days… you came early, didn't you?"
Ravien didn't even turn her head when she replied.
What the heck? Does she have eyes on the back of her head?
"I thought the meeting point was in the east of the island?"
"The actual departure is on the twentieth, right? I saw that the other teams who arrived earlier are just resting nearby."
Well, that's true.  And I didn’t plan to say anything anyway.
"When did you arrive?"
"Two days ago."
"Two days ago……?"
… That means she arrived on the sixteenth?  Did she go from the first floor to the sixth floor in almost two weeks?
Although I dislike her individualism as a team member, I had to acknowledge one thing.
"… I can see why you want to move independently."
At that speed, she must have successfully speedrunned all floors, from the first to the sixth. I understand why she didn’t enter with us.  If she’d stayed with us, she would have missed out on twelve free experience points.
'If she keeps this up, it'll be even harder to convince her.'
This is becoming more complicated. Forcing her to move with us from the first floor just because we’re on the same team feels like a power trip.
"Whatever, get up."
"Why?"
"We couldn’t really chat in the city because you were so busy."
"Okay."
I was worried she’d just say she’d stay here until the gathering, but Ravien readily accepted the proposal and headed to the east of the island, where the gathering point was located.
"Nice to meet you. It’s been a while since we met at the founding ceremony, right?"
"I’m sorry about that. I had some family matters to attend to. From now on, I’ll try to make time even when I’m in the city."
"That would be appreciated. Ravien will do, right?"
"Yes. Call me whatever you like. Mr. Ashid."
The conversation was going a lot smoother than I expected.
"May I call you Ravien-yang?"
Old Man Diddy cautiously asked, knowing the dragonkin's age is different from humans. Ravien didn't hesitate and told him to go ahead.
And…
"What about the two of you? How should I address you?"
Ravien turned her head towards Amelia and Erwin.
"Call me Emilia, or Rains, whatever you prefer."
"Mr. Rains will do."
"Call me Tercia."
Erwin’s voice was sharp and clear.  Ravien met her gaze with strange eyes and smiled brightly.
"Okay, Tercia."
Okay, so the name thing is done…
'...But why are we sorting this out on the sixth floor?'
Can we even call this a team? 
Despite my doubts, I got straight to the point.
"We practiced together in the city and got to know each other on the way here."
"I get it. You want to know about me too, right?"
"We need to know who we can trust."
"I understand."
After that, Ravien drew the sword she was wearing around her waist and showcased some of her skills, explaining what role she could play during battle.  Well, she left a few things unsaid…
But it’s not uncommon for magicians, priests, or ability users to do so in restricted professions. It wasn’t anything new.
"So, where should I stand during movement?"
"The rear."
"And during combat?"
"Emilia will be behind my left, and you’ll be behind my right."
"That’s pretty classic."
"There’s no point in complicating things when we don’t know each other well enough."
Ravien chuckled, seemingly understanding the underlying meaning behind my words.
"Are you going to keep this up?"
"I didn’t say anything wrong."
Well, let's just assume the tension is out of the way for now. 
Next, the magician and the ability user also explained their positions to Ravien. It didn't take long, but I found myself getting annoyed. Why do we have to do this twice? We could have done it once in the city. Maybe individualism is just another word for inefficiency.
"Here they come."
"The expedition leader is here, so we can’t be slacking on the beach, can we?"
Soon after, the teams of Akuraba and the paladin arrived at the gathering point in the eastern part of the island.
And then, what felt like a few more moments later…
“The third team arrived as well.”
The eastern part of the island, which was slightly higher, allowed us to see the expedition members entering the sixth floor in real-time. It was the team led by James Kara, the vice-leader of the Sharptooth clan...
“They look pretty messed up.”
“Seems like they prioritized speed even at the cost of their health.”
I understand their psychology.  The gathering date was the twentieth, but arriving last might be seen as a measure of their skills. This is also a kind of competition.
‘This is like the Tang Dynasty army.’
Internal competition? It’s a good tool for leadership, but it only works when a sense of belonging to the group has already been established.  In this current situation, making them compete with each other will only lead to internal strife.
‘How can I make them work as one?’
As a leader, it’s a question I’m destined to ask. While pondering this, night fell.  That’s when the fifth team, led by the knight Kaislan, finally arrived.
“Damn it…!”
Even though they arrived two days earlier than the designated date, he clenched his fist in anger upon realizing he was last.  
Ugh, is he malfunctioning again?
"What are you doing there? Come over here."
"… Yes, I understand."
He flinched at my gesture and came over.  See, getting angry will only give you wrinkles! 
Pat, pat.  I patted his shoulder in encouragement and stood up.
"We have two more days before the designated date, but now that everyone is here, there’s no point in wasting time."
"Oh, so are we going to hear about our mission now?"
"Well, it’s better to keep the other members in the dark for now."
"That’s fine, there’s nothing to hide anyway. It's not like they could tell anyone else even if they did hear it."
My words prompted the members who were awkwardly watching to move closer to the center. They decided to listen openly, as they had my permission.
"So, tell us. What’s going on?  Why are you keeping this mission a secret? Only you, the expedition leader, know about this mission.”
I saw Akuraba’s curious gaze across the flickering fire. Please, can the dwarves avoid sitting on the chairs?  Look, you can’t even see their faces properly because of the fire.  I’m not even making a big fire! 
Anyway, that’s not important.  
"Ahem."
I cleared my throat, mindful of my leadership image.
"You’re all probably curious. If the Noarks are entering the Dark Continent through a portal, where is that location?"
"Yes. If it's like the Crystal Cave and has a starting point, that place would be their base."
"So, did the Royal Family finally find out where it is?"
“Yes." 
I revealed the top-secret information I’d received from the Viscount, causing a commotion among the members.  Ugh, it’s not time to freak out yet.
"Our mission is to attack their base." 
If this were a military analogy, we would be a mobile strike force. While the main force draws attention on the battlefield, we would destroy the enemy’s core force or facilities.
"… I have a question. If our mission is this, then why is the schedule so tight?”
“Are you planning to make us break through the Gorge of the Dead?”
“… That’s crazy! It’s impossible to cross that gorge with a single ship unless we join the main force! ”
Ugh, he’s still interrupting me.  It's another Tang Dynasty army trait that they interrupt as soon as someone starts speaking.
I spoke before the misunderstanding grew any further.
"We are not crossing the Gorge of the Dead."
"What? You said we’re attacking the Dark Continent base, but what the hell…."
"That’s your last warning. Stop interrupting.”
… Okay, finally some peace and quiet.
I explained our mission in detail amidst the calm atmosphere. 
"There’s more than one path to the Dark Continent, right?”
“Ah, so you’re saying…!”
Yes, have you figured it out?  What’s the point of me calling you to the eastern part of the island?
“We are heading to Ice Rock in the east."
The Goblin Forest, the Beast’s Lair, the Rock Desert, the Land of the Dead. Just like the four fields classified as the second floor are connected to the Pilgrim’s Path on the third floor, the seventh floor also has more than just the Dark Continent. 
In other words…
"We’re going to enter the Dark Continent through the eighth floor, catch those bastards off guard, and strike.”
It’s like eating a cake frozen solid.  Hard to chew, and sometimes even makes your teeth hurt. You’ll be constantly wondering why you have to go through all this trouble to eat it. 
“Anyone who doesn’t understand, speak up.”
…
"Good, seems like there aren't any cowards."
The aftertaste, though, will be sweet.
