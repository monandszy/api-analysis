## Chapter 434: The Lion's Return (5)
The reunion with Ainar was as I expected. Tearful reunions didn't quite suit barbarians.  This, however, was more like it.
"Bjöööörn!"
"Ainar, it's been a while—"
"BehelaaaaAAAAAAAAAA!!"
Ainar shoved me back towards the courtyard the moment I stepped through the gate.  Then…
"You tricked meeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!"
The brawl commenced without delay.  He must have been furious about my faked death, which stretched over two years, and the fact I'd pretended to be a Lihen Schweiz after our meeting in the library.  Given the torment he must have endured, I wasn't going to begrudge him a few punches. 
But he wasn't looking for a fair fight. 
"BehelaaaaAAAAAAAAAA!!"
He roared the name of the ancestral spirit as we grappled. 
Whack!
A fist connected with my face.
"AAAAAAARGH!!"
Our brawl devolved into a wrestling match on the lawn. 
How long had it been?  I'd grabbed the greatsword Ainar had flung to the ground, and was just about to shout for Erwen to bring my hammer, when…
"Both of you, stop it!"
Erwen intervened, bringing our reunion fight to an end.  Her meticulously cared-for garden was now in shambles.  Erwen looked close to tears, but I pretended not to notice.  Ainar came first, after all.
"Tsk!"
Ainar spat a mouthful of blood onto the grass, then grinned.
"What, is it really you, Bjorn...?"
Natural barbarian?
He really just let it go so easily.  Misha would have berated me for a good while, then slammed a frost attack into my gut.
"Ainar, you haven't changed a bit."
"Oh, yeah? I feel like I've changed a lot."
Ainar shrugged, then walked over to me and gave me a couple of pats on the chest.
"I'm sure I wouldn't understand whatever you've been through, even if you explained it. You've always been like that. But even so..."
"Even so?"
"I'm just glad you're alive, Bjorn."
"Ah..."
I was speechless for a moment.  It was his sincerity, hidden within his stoic voice.  Perhaps he felt awkward about the situation too.
"But... what's with that scrawny body?"
Ainar looked down at me, and I felt a pang of shame.  A blow to my barbarian pride, you might say.  My mouth, for some reason, was opening faster than ever.
"It's because of the essence!  The kind you ate, the Bonnite Essence!  Don't worry, I'll get rid of it soon!  I've got my name back, so it'll be gone before you know it!"
"Hmm, is that so? Do it as soon as possible. A Bjorn shorter than me is an eyesore, you know."
It felt like a dagger pierced my heart.
"And... I guess I'll have to hold off on taking you to the holy ground.  If our people saw you like this... they'd be disappointed."
...My heart ached.  He might as well have said I couldn't play the game properly.
'Ugh, I've got to get rid of this gacha essence soon.'
"So... is that the end of the reunion?"
Raven finally chimed in on the conversation.  Ainar acknowledged her presence.
"Oh! Aruru! You too, long time no see!"
"We saw each other half a year ago, is that all you've got?"
"Hahaha! You worry too much! If you keep doing that, you won't grow tall."
"It doesn't matter if I worry, I'm not going to grow tall anyway!"
"Don't lose hope. Look, I'm tall, right?"
"That's because you ate that essence!"
Raven yelled back, and Ainar chuckled, scratching his ear.  Raven, in response, held her head in her hands.
It was a scene that somehow filled my chest with a warm feeling.
'Long time no see...'
This feeling of nostalgia.  It wasn't just me.  Raven was smiling despite her irritated tone as she followed Ainar into the house.
"...I'm glad."
"What?"
"That you're back to your old self."
"...What are you talking about, let's go in."
"Yes."
The reunion in the garden concluded, and we moved the conversation indoors.  After Raven, Ainar exchanged awkward greetings with Erwen, and then it was Amelia's turn.
"Barbarian, long time no—"
What are you trying to pretend you know me?
I quickly cut Amelia off.
"You know each other, right?"
"Know each other... ?"
Ainar tilted his head.
To be honest, I was speechless.  He had been so depressed about losing his warrior's honor because of her, and yet…
Well, I suppose he didn't recognize her in Parune Island either. 
"Ah, ah... I remember now!  The Noirark woman who was the last one left with Bjorn!"
Ainar nodded in confirmation, having apparently retained some memories of Parune Island.
"So, her name is..."
"Emily Rains."
"Ah, that's right, that was it!"
What name is that?
We never even exchanged names back then.  We just called each other ‘looter’ or ‘that woman’ back then, no one cared about names.
'Should I just ignore the fact she trampled my honor back in the second floor?'
I was deep in thought when...
"Emily Rains, is it?"
"So?"
Ainar, with an unexpected friendly tone, addressed Amelia.
"First of all, let me express my gratitude."
"...Huh?"
"I may not know much about you, but Bjorn wouldn't have stayed with you unless you were a dependable person."
Ainar, with an uncharacteristic seriousness, expressed his gratitude to Amelia.
"Thank you for being by Bjorn's side during his most difficult time."
"...It's not something I need to be thanked for."
"Hahaha! It's my job! I'm a little upset that you weren't the one Bjorn leaned on, but I can't help it, given my current state!"
"..."
"I'm not as smart as Aruru, and I'm not as blindly devoted as that elf to betray my tribe."
"...Are you saying you're insulting me right now?"
After a long pause, Erwen frowned and spoke up.  Ainar slipped out of the situation like a snake.
"Hahaha, did it sound like that?"
Wow, he's denying it, but not entirely.  Whatever happened, Ainar's verbal skills have definitely improved.
"Anyway, that's enough of that, let's talk. I heard about you at the tavern and came rushing here, but what exactly happened to you?"
We then spent a while recounting my past adventures.  Of course, it wasn't a completely honest account, but a somewhat filtered story…
"Oh!"
"Ah!"
"Uh!"
"I see."
Ainar repeated these four interjections throughout my explanation.  Unlike Erwen or Raven, my story was over quickly.  It was a clear advantage of the barbarian tribe: they never dragged things out. 
But…
"...That concludes my story."
"Oh!"
That was also a major flaw when conversing with barbarians. It's impossible to tell whether they actually understood, unless you ask directly.
"Did you understand?"
"To some degree!"
"...Then that's good enough."
End of story.
I moved on to the next topic without hesitation.
"You must have been shocked too, Ainar."
"Huh?"
"I was declared a demon by the royal family. You must have been shocked, not just you, but all of our people."
"Ah, that? It wasn't that big of a deal."
"...It wasn't that big of a deal?"
"What kind of nonsense is that? How could you be a demon? No one in our tribe believed it. We just thought the royal family made a mistake again."
Oh, I see...
It was a completely different answer than I expected, but I had to continue anyway.
"But, you know, just out of curiosity, and with no ill intentions, what if... "
I cautiously tested Ainar.
"What if I was a demon?"
This was crucial for dealing with him going forward.  Depending on his answer, I could either retract my entire story and reveal the truth, or...
Ainar's response would be everything.
Not just me, Erwen, Amelia, and Raven all swallowed nervously.
"Hahaha! Bjorn, you, a demon? What a funny thing to say!"
"Don't dismiss it as a joke, give it some thought. I want to know your answer."
In that strange atmosphere, Ainar couldn't hold back any longer.
"Hmm, you, Bjorn, a demon... Well, I guess there's only one answer."
"One answer... ?"
"Would that mean you'd accept it, that you're a demon?  A comrade we shared time and affection with?"
Erwen and Raven chimed in with their own questions, and Ainar tilted his head.
"What are you two talking about?  Of course, we should kill him!"
"Kill... him...?"
"The tribal leader said so! Demons are beings that must be killed!"
Ugh, I see...
This is going to be tough...
***
Raven and Ainar's visit continued until late that night.  We had tea, and then dinner with a bit of wine.  Naturally, the dinner turned into a drinking session.
"It's getting late... I should get going."
Late into the night, Raven gathered her coat and prepared to leave.  Ainar, who had been downing drinks from the start, had already passed out.  He even had a hangover cure the next morning before he departed.
"I have things to do from today, right? Let me know when you're done with everything. Stop by the holy ground too. I said it yesterday, but everyone will be happy to see you."
"Alright..."
After Ainar left, Erwen prepared to go out as well.  Given what happened in the labyrinth, she had to show her face at the holy ground, right?
"I'll watch the house."
After Erwen left, I entrusted the house to Amelia and went out alone. As I told Ainar yesterday, I had a lot to do from today.
"Lord Yandell is here..."
As Erwen warned, there was a large crowd gathered in front of my house.  Of course, everyone in the city would have heard my story by now.  There were people who acted like reporters in this world, and those who were simply there to gawk at me.
"Lord Yandell! Just a word, please!"
"Wooooo!"
"Shake my hand!"
Wow, so Ainar managed to slip through this crowd?  Well, it wouldn't have been too difficult.
"BehelaaaaAAAAAAAAAA!!"
Roaring the name of the ancestral spirit, I bulldozed through the crowd.
"Ah! H-he's running!"
"Follow him!!"
He's running?
I was just charging forward.
Thud, thud, thud-
Overpowering their resistance with brute strength, I blasted through the crowd and sprinted down the empty morning streets.  A few chased after me, but I soon left them behind.
'Well, let's go then...'
Donning a large robe in the dim alley, I followed the map to my destination.
The closest one was…
'Here it is.'
A small, modest house with a striking red door.  I confirmed the name on the plaque, took a deep breath, and gently knocked.
Knock, knock.
After a moment, a woman with a haggard face opened the door.
"You are...!"
She couldn't hide her shock at seeing my face.
Well, it wasn't surprising.
"May I enter, Mrs. Ashde?"
She chewed her lip, then turned aside, allowing me to enter.
"I, I haven't prepared anything... would you like some tea at least?"
"It's fine. I'm not here for a reception. I'm here to return something."
"Return something...?"
Instead of answering, I pulled an object from my dimensional space.
The woman carefully untied the cloth and confirmed the ash-colored remains in the box.  Then she collapsed.
"Ah, ah, ah..."
"I'm sorry. It was a messy situation back then. I wish I could have brought it back in a better condition."
"Ah, ah..."
"Here, these are the items Ashde owned. I've organized them in my dimensional space, so check them out later. Let me know if anything is missing."
"..."
"Even if it's not about that, feel free to visit if you have any requests or if I can be of any help. I've written my address down here."
"Hhhhuuu..."
"If you'd rather I leave, I will."
No answer came.
But I took her silence as agreement and slowly stood up.
Just then…
"Wait...!"
"..."
"Wait, please... don't leave..."
She said that and went towards the kitchen, then returned with a cup of tea with a strong aroma.
"He... always brought out this tea whenever he had a guest."
"Is that so... I'm not much of a tea connoisseur, but it smells nice. It's light and mellow, just like him."
"Tell me... about him... what was he like... ?"
"I guess I'll need another cup of tea."
I then began my story, sipping tea to moisten my throat.  Most of it was trivial.
I couldn't reveal the truth after all.
Little incidents during our expedition.
Conversation I shared with him in passing.
His subtle attentiveness and actions, barely noticeable to the dull-witted…
"That's why everyone on the expedition team loved him. You know, he wasn't flashy, but it was somehow comforting and reassuring to have him around..."
"Y-yes... Truly."
"He was always a good listener, yet strangely, he never spoke much about himself.  So everyone was so surprised when he first spoke about his wife..."
"Did... he mention me... ?"
"Yes."
"What... did he say...?"
"He said she was strong."
"..."
"But he also said she would definitely cry if he was gone."
"Hhhuuu, hhhhuuu..."
The woman, who had been diligently holding back tears since receiving the remains, hung her head.
I stared blankly ahead and waited for her to calm down.
And after a while...
"Thank you... for coming... like this..."
"Don't thank me. I learned about a good tea thanks to you."
"...Are you going to the others?"
I nodded slightly.
"That's all the survivors can do."
After leaving Ashde's home, I visited the homes of the rest of the expedition members.
Those who had returned with remains, I gave them back.  If they didn't, I gave them back some of their possessions.  If they didn't have even that, I bowed my head and apologized.
Their reactions were all different.
"Hmph, isn't this the great hero, Lord Yandell? What brings you to such a humble place?"
Some scoffed.
Others simply accepted the items and turned me away.
Some doubted the contents of the expedition report, while others were touched that the great hero had remembered them.
But one thing was certain.
"Come on, Maylin... let's go say hi to Mom... "
"Is... this Mom?  Why?"
I was a sinner in their eyes, no matter how they reacted.  I would probably continue to carry this burden until the day I could proudly tell them the truth of what happened. 
Day one, day two, day three…
Time flowed.
Visiting the homes of the fallen expedition members took longer than a few days.
Day four, day five, day six...
The days turned into weeks, and then into months.
And then…
[Your character's soul resonates and is drawn to a specific world.]
That day finally came.
