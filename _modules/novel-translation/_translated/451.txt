## The Barbarian's Road (Chapter 451)
As I emerged from the pit after my duel with the chieftain, the warriors, who had been roaring with excitement, suddenly fell silent and turned to stare at me. Their gazes seemed to be awaiting some kind of proclamation.
“BE-HELLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL!!” 
I let loose a crude battle cry, and the warriors responded in kind, their voices echoing through the forest. 
My ears rang.
With a swift motion, I turned my gaze down into the pit and watched as the elders carried the fallen chieftain away, their movements a testament to the finality of defeat. No warrior lingered to witness the chieftain’s departure, his fading figure a mere footnote in the grand narrative of victory. This, though seemingly ruthless, was simply the natural order of things in this culture. The victor and the vanquished—it was all part of the cosmic dance, nothing more, nothing less. 
“KOOONG! KOOONG! KOOONG! KOOONG!”
With no preparations made, the celebration began in earnest. Warriors who possessed some musical talent pounded on drums, while those lacking such skills simply beat their chests with their fists. All danced freely, their voices merging into a symphony of revelry, their goblets raised high in a toast to victory. 
A large fire was hastily built from felled trees, and meat, its origins a mystery, was roasted and distributed amongst the warriors. The celebration continued as the sun dipped below the horizon.
“Great Warrior! Where are you going?!”
“Hush.”
I slipped away from the center of the raucous festival, heading towards the residential area. Warriors I encountered along the way attempted to engage me in conversation, but their excitement seemed to have waned, giving way to their own revelry. 
“THUD, THUD.”
The further I walked away from the heart of the celebration, the darker and quieter the surrounding forest became.
“KOOONG! KOOONG!” 
The sound of drums resonated faintly through the woods, a distant echo of the festivities.  Emerging from the shadows, I saw Einar walking towards me. She had been absent from the celebration since its early stages.
“Bjorn? What brings you here?”
Einar seemed puzzled by my absence from the celebrations. 
“I was going to check on the chieftain. Where is he?”
“He’s in his tent.”
“Is he awake?”
“I’m not sure, but he was asleep a little while ago.”
“You were just coming from there?”
“Yes… I was a little worried about him.”
“Oh?”
I didn’t press her on the source of her worry. After all, hadn’t Einar been glued to the chieftain’s side, eager to learn from him ever since I was presumed dead?  She must have been feeling a mixture of emotions.  She surely had plenty to say. 
“Congratulations, Bjorn! I found out later that you are the first. There has never been a warrior who became chieftain at such a young age!”
“In other words, I’m the youngest, right?”
“Y, yes! That’s it! The youngest! Isn’t that amazing?”
While it was news to me, it didn’t feel particularly real.
“Anyway, if you’re going to see the chieftain, why don’t you come with me?”
“But weren’t you just coming from there?”
“Ha! What does it matter? I was on my way to see you anyway!”
“Then, in that case.”
As I walked towards the chieftain’s tent with Einar, we exchanged a few words.  Most of it revolved around the duel and the chieftain’s current state.  His wounds were almost healed.
“Those elders are such cheapskates! They insisted he’d heal without potions, so I had to pour all my potions on him! Is that even logical?!”
“...?”
“It was the same with the coming-of-age ceremony! I said I wanted to at least give him proper shoes! The stubborn elders kept going on about tradition. I told them I was being reasonable!”
“Einar.”
“Yes?”
“In that case, you should say, ‘It’s unreasonable’ instead.”
“Ah… Really?”
Einar scratched the back of her head, looking sheepish after I corrected her wording. 
And…
“THUD, THUD.”
We walked in silence for a while, the sound of our footsteps echoing through the forest.
Einar finally spoke again as the chieftain’s tent came into view. 
“Bjorn.”
Einar slowed her pace, falling behind me and lightly hitting my shoulder. “I really think you’re better than me. You’re smarter, stronger, and the warriors follow you even when you don’t have to do anything.”
So, you weren’t unaffected after all. 
“Einar—”
I turned back to say something, but Einar cut me off.
“So, please take care of the tribe.”
“...?”
“You’re a hundred and fifty times better than me! All the other warriors think so too!”
I had no idea where the number one hundred and fifty came from, but I just nodded. 
“Okay.”
“Really? That’s all I needed to hear. Go on. You’ve reached your destination. I’m going to go back and join the warriors. I need some fun and rest.”
“Okay. See you later.”
Einar turned and walked back towards the forest, and I entered the chieftain’s tent.
“You’ve arrived.”
To my surprise, the chieftain was awake. He looked quite well, actually. Was it Einar’s potions? He had some swelling, but that was all. 
“CREAK.”
I pulled out a barbarian-style chair and sat down without asking for permission.
“How are you feeling?”
“I’m fine enough that you don’t have to worry about me.”
“Oh?”
I had simply asked out of politeness.
Having covered the necessary pleasantries, I moved directly to the point.
“When are you going to give me the chieftain’s position?”
“Tomorrow. As soon as the sun rises.”
I hadn’t anticipated that answer. 
“I thought it would take a while since you’d need to contact the other warriors.”
“Everyone in the city has heard about you by now. Anyone who wants to come will come on their own.”
Well, he’s not wrong about that.
The number of warriors who came seeking news of the festival increased exponentially.
“But… you seem surprisingly relaxed for someone who fought so hard.”
My second question was prompted by personal curiosity.
“I’ve always thought this position wasn’t right for me.  Of course, it stings to lose.”
“I see.”
“So, why did you come looking for me?”
The chieftain, certain that I had another reason for visiting, asked this, and I let out a chuckle before revealing my true purpose.
“I want to hear about the King.”
“…The King?”
“Yes, what kind of person is he?”
Tomorrow, I would be the chieftain. 
It was time to uncover the dark secrets of the kingdom, shrouded by its fortified walls.
***
“The King…”
The chieftain leaned against the wall and chuckled wryly.
“Only once.”
“What?”
“I’ve only met him once.”
That was unexpected. I had assumed he knew a lot about the king from his earlier description of him as an intimidating figure.
“It was towards the end of the relic war… over 13 years ago. I had just become chieftain.  I participated in the Interracial Summit with the ambition to rebuild our tribe that had fallen into decline, and that’s where I first saw him.”
The chieftain’s breath hitched as he stared into empty space.  It was as if the memory of that day had returned to him.
“What… happened there?”
“At first, it was just a normal summit. The dwarf and the beastmen were rambling on about something, and I was busy arguing with the ear-elongated ones, and the old mage who was representing the humans. You know, the usual.”
“A mage? Shouldn’t the human representative be the king?”
“You’d think so, but that’s how it’s always been since I became chieftain.  Someone else always represented the humans at the summits in place of the king.”
“...I see.”
This was news to me.
As a mere warrior, I had no access to information regarding the Interracial Summit, where representatives of each race would gather.
“Anyway, that’s why that day was special.”
A meeting with the king, a rare occurrence.
However, the chieftain still wasn’t sure why the King had appeared during the summit.
“I was in the middle of a heated debate with the old mage when I realized he was there. No one, including myself, knew who he was. One of us even shouted at him to get out. But…”
“…But?”
“He only said one thing.”
Kneel, my servants.
The moment those words left the king’s lips, the chieftains forgot their questions and their retorts. They rose to their feet and knelt before him. 
And…
“Even though we didn’t know who he was, the words just came out of our mouths.”
“What did you say?”
“We greet our King.”
It was a truly chilling experience, the chieftain added. He described the absolute helplessness he felt, the moment those words left his lips, the King’s presence eradicating even the will to resist.
Of course, I was interested in a different aspect.
‘Manipulation ability… could he be a mage?’
What was the source of the King’s power?
For starters, there’s no essence in the Labyrinth that allows you to manipulate a target without any form of contact.
So, it could be magic.
However, the chieftain shook his head firmly when I suggested this possibility.
“It wasn’t like magic or essence. It was like his voice had power. It felt like it was engraved in my blood and soul from birth. He is my king, my master.”
I was becoming increasingly confused as I listened to his tale, but I decided to hear him out.
“What happened next?”
“Nothing much. He just looked around at us, like he was searching for someone, and said, ‘He’s not here,’ and left. We finally exhaled the breath we’d been holding.”
And that was the entirety of the chieftain’s encounter with the King.  Before launching into my investigation, I needed to check a few things.
“How strong were the chieftains at the time? Well… Most of them were around my level.”
The King’s ‘manipulation ability’ was beyond extraordinary.
He had manipulated five high-ranking explorers, all above Level 8, with a single sentence.
Moreover, there seemed to be no limitations on his range.
“You mean they couldn’t resist because it was a simple command? That’s ridiculous. They’d rather die than kneel before a stranger.”
The chieftain was certain.
He was certain that if the King had ordered them to die, they would have died right then and there.
‘If it’s not essence or magic… what kind of sorcery is the King using?’
I don’t know.
But luckily, I had a glimmer of hope left.
“Oh, by the way, the old mage from the Tower, he realized who the King was after we knelt, and he followed suit.”
Perhaps, it doesn’t work on humans.
It’s a possibility, but it’s not confirmed.
The King might have only targeted the chieftains.
‘…Anyway, it’s clear the King has that ability.’
Feeling that this was a decent haul of information, I asked one final question.
“What did the King look like? Did he look sick?”
“….I don’t remember. How old he was, if he was male or female, even the voice that pierced my ears… everything is blurry.”
Hmmm… Could it be that the King can manipulate memories?
Or maybe he used some magic or an item that had that effect. Unlike his manipulation ability, there were several ways to achieve similar effects.
“Well, have I satisfied your curiosity about the King?”
“Somewhat.”
“Is that so? Good.”
The chieftain waved his hands dismissively, as if he wanted me to leave now that we’d finished our business.
And…
‘Something’s off.’
His demeanor held me back.
“Chieftain, can I ask just one more thing?”
“Hurry up.”
“Why do you seem so indifferent? You know I’m going to be chieftain, don’t you?”
In the past, the chieftain had told me that if we hated humans, we’d have nowhere to live.  That we had to endure their injustices. While it seemed frustrating from my perspective, it was logical from his standpoint.
But…
“Why should I care? I’m not the chieftain anymore, nor anything else.”
The chieftain chuckled, as if I’d just made a ridiculous statement.
“From tomorrow, I am a barbarian.”
No longer a chieftain, but a warrior. 
“And…”
As a warrior, he told me,
“From the ancient times, we’ve always been on the side of the clash. So, how is that for an answer?”
“…It’s enough.”
“Good. I’m hungry, so get out.”
Following the chieftain’s dismissal, I exited the tent and went to sleep in a random one.
The next morning.
“WA-AAAAAA-!!!”
Before over ten thousand warriors.
“Warriors, I, Bjorn, son of Yandell, swear on my warrior’s name!”
It wouldn’t make sense to speak in complex language, anyway.
Short and simple.
“We will grow stronger. We will reclaim everything we lost. And we will forge ahead!”
I declared, gazing towards the wall beyond the forest.
And…
“Character’s tribal rank changed from ‘Regular Warrior’ to ‘Chieftain.’”
“Character’s special stat ‘Support’ created.”
And thus, I became the Barbarian Road.
