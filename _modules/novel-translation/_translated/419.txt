## The Eye of the Glacier (5)
The Glacier Mage, Kariadea.
Its species name is Elder Lich, categorized as Rank 3, and it is a superior variant species called a Named.
This special boss only appears for a certain period, between ten days and five days before the closure of the seventh floor.
"That was about 10% of it."
This is why I had to live as an atheist.
The condition for this thing to be summoned is purely luck.
But it appeared at this moment, with eight days left.
"Why today of all days, when there's still tomorrow. Or maybe I should say thanks for coming out at least three days late…"
It's like a glass half full.
Both positive and negative perspectives are possible.
"...Damn it."
No matter how you look at it, the situation is undeniably negative.
Of course, the worst-case scenario was avoided.
After all, there was only one day left before I could leave the Eye of the Glacier.
I wouldn't encounter the boss monster.
Its nature was to appear at the bottom and slowly ascend.
But the problem was...
"What are you all doing! Snap out of it and block these guys!"
"...Be careful! These are stronger than normal skeletons!"
It was an army of skeletons that began to crawl up the cliff from the moment this thing was summoned.
Even if the monsters weren't coming from the front but climbing up from below, the ones trailing behind would easily break through the area we had cleared.
"The distance will keep closing in."
I was definitely awake, but my head felt foggy.
Damn it, why does this shitty situation have to happen right now?
And Hans wasn't even among us?
Could there be another Hans I didn't notice?  Maybe on the pursuing team, not ours?
That was when the thought dawned on me.
Slap-!
I slapped both of my cheeks.
Not too hard, just enough to wake myself up.
"Lee Hansoo, don't be ridiculous."
It was a kind of avoidance psychology.
Searching for Hans when something unfortunate happened.
"It's just that things happened that way."
What happened in the Larkaz Labyrinth?
When I coincidentally encountered the Dragon Slayer, went through all that suffering, and lost precious companions.
Was Hans there then?
Or in the Crystal Cave on the first floor, where the Lord of the Abyss appeared?
There was a miracle of Hans not being there out of nearly a thousand people, but when did things ever go smoothly?
Looking back, that's how it was.
Hans wasn't there when I went through really shitty situations.
It was as if the heavens wouldn't give me any loopholes to blame.
"...Then was Hans actually a lucky charm?"
The thought suddenly came to mind, but well, it seemed that wasn't the case.
Still, thanks to my pointless thinking, my head was much clearer.
A smirk.
Hans or whatever, what difference does it make.
I only have to do what I have to do.
So, in that sense...
"Yandel! The soldiers are in disarray. Do you have any orders?"
I heard Kaislan's voice approaching and opened my eyes that had been closed.
"Form a breakthrough formation."
"Are you planning to break through?"
"It's pointless to block them."
After giving Kaislan instructions, I moved to the front of the formation.
"Old man, don't overdo it."
"What? Aren't you going to stop me this time?"
"But... you have the same eyes as you did in the Crystal Cave back then..."
Well, I didn't see myself in the mirror back then, so I don't know.
I hope the outcome will be similar to that time.
"The character has cast [Enlargement]."
I activated the now standard battle mode and raised my shield and hammer.  But without armor, just a fur coat over my bare body, huh?
"Wow, a real barbarian."
The Barbarian Barbarian Mode, as it's called.
"Yandel, everyone is ready!"
The news of the formation's completion arrived, and I hesitated, looking at the skeletons blocking our path.
"Ah, I don't have to hold back anymore?"
Good, that's one positive thing.
Let's go.
"Behel—laaaaaaaaaa!!!"
With the blessing of my ancestral god, I believe I shall prevail.
***
Kuung-! Kuung-!
I run forward, with my shield covering my entire upper body like a shield charge.
Kwaaang-!
I put my weight on the shield with my shoulder and push the bony brats aside.
Ah, by the way, I am the only one at the very front.
The rest of the vanguard, including the melee units, have been moved back to defend the flanks and rear.
"Push them back!"
The soldiers following behind, joining the attack and dealing with the skeletons climbing up from the cliffs on our sides.
"Aaaagh!"
"Get lost, you little bastards!"
"Ugh, ugh..."
Among the deafening roar of the fierce battle, groans were occasionally heard instead of shouts.
It was inevitable.
The vanguard had all discarded their armor.
Swoosh-!
A skeleton's rib thrust cut through someone's skin and grazed them.
"The character, Riard Ashid, has cast the Rank 5 cursed magic [Regeneration Inhibition]."
The mages kept casting cursed magic on their allies, fearing the inverse effect of their natural regeneration, but it was like peeing on frozen feet.
It merely slowed down the time it took for the wounds to worsen.
The injuries weren't healing.
Screech-!
Torn wounds would open wider with every violent movement, and the unhealed wounds would lead to endless bleeding.
In the meantime, the wounds festered and rotted.
Even if they kept casting cursed magic, they couldn't reduce natural regeneration to zero. The guys who usually ate regeneration essences were the vanguard, so would they not have any resistance?
"Damn it, I didn't expect discarding equipment to come back to haunt us like this."
One hour, two hours, three hours.
The longer the expedition moved forward, piercing through the monsters, the more casualties arose in the expedition.
Even a small wound would hamper movement and lead to more injuries, a vicious cycle.
If they had cast mana shields, they wouldn't be getting hurt like this.
But...
"It's not like peeing on frozen feet, it's like drinking seawater because you're thirsty."
How can you cast mana shields for this many people?
Mana would run out in three hours, for sure—
Kwaaang-!
Damn it, I can't even take my eyes off things.
The situation was critical at the rear, but mine wasn't any better.
"Behel—laaaaaaaaaaa!!!"
I was pushing through the monsters with all my strength, carving a path through them.
The energy expenditure from that was intense.
No, it wasn't even a matter of energy, if it weren't for [Primal Cells] and [Soul Dive], my MP would have drained out long ago, and [Enlargement] would have deactivated.
"Ugh, this is a pain."
Not only that, I was accumulating wounds.
My physical resistance would effectively make me immune to damage from these trash mobs, but...
Skeletons don't just use physical attacks.
If I got hit by a bone explosion, which applies cold damage, at close range, even I would inevitably shed a drop of blood.
"Yandel! That guy's in front again!"
How long had it been since I'd taken down one?  A huge skeleton appeared.
With its four heads taller than me, even in my [Enlargement] state, it would be classified as a large, but this one was a medium.
There are separate large skeletons.
Kuung-! Kuung-!
A super-large skeleton emerged from the darkness, its red eyes glowing as it crawled up the cliff.
"Underneath! That thing is coming up again!"
"Divine—!!!"
Once again, before it could climb all the way up, the priests unleashed divine spells and sent it falling.
"Grrrrrr—!!!!!"
The super-large skeleton, roaring with a fierce cry that echoed through the entire area, fled.
Damn it, it will be back in a few minutes, looking for something to eat.
It's obvious.
Kwak-!
First, I crushed the skull of the medium skeleton that had blocked my path with a [Swing].
No time to catch my breath.
Again, I push aside the bony brats with my shield, carving a path forward.
"Kkkkkk."
As I repeated the process, I kept laughing.
Not out of joy, but because I felt like I would go crazy if I didn't laugh.
Kwak-!
My muscles screamed.
Kwak-!
My head was numb.
"Aaaaargh!!!"
Despite my condition, my body continued to repeat what it had been doing.
Holding on to the most positive thoughts I could.
"At least it's a good thing they aren't catching up yet."
It had been almost four hours since the monster wave began.
I couldn't even use detection magic to estimate the distance because of the monsters, but the pursuing team hadn't caught up to us yet.
They seemed to be moving cautiously.
Well, those bastards don't like getting hurt either, do they?
"They're probably moving defensively."
On the other hand, we're pushing forward like charcoal briquettes about to turn to ash, burning ourselves completely.
Even if I get hurt more, the expedition has to move forward.
I'm carving a path forward with that mindset, if I get caught, it'll be a shame.
Wobble-!
Without realizing, I lost strength in my legs and barely managed to regain my balance.
"...Did I bleed too much?"
Well, it seems so.
My body right now is like a punctured water bag.
Wounds that would have scabbed over in a matter of seconds were all over my body, spewing blood.
Therefore...
"I'm going to be in danger if I keep going like this..."
I made a decision.
Survival is about making choices, after all.
Choosing the lesser of two evils.
"Marone, cauterize my wounds with fire."
"...What did you say?"
"It's time to stop the bleeding."
"Cauterize? What kind of crazy... No, how can you say that without changing your expression!  How can you say that at all?"
The mage, hearing my request, was horrified.
It's not just the pain, but if the burned area rots, it could become irreversible, right?
It's not an unusual statement.
My wounds are already rotting, and...
"It will all heal once we reach the top."
Getting to the destination is priority.
"It could lead to a situation even divine power cannot fix. You could have permanent damage to your body..."
Marone, seeing my resolve, muttered a disclaimer as if she knew I wouldn't back down.
It's like a doctor telling you not to drink or smoke for three days.
I disregarded her words, like a true barbarian.
"It's better than dying here."
"I'll do it. I'll do it. But I don't understand. Why would you do that...!"
She clenched her fists, not understanding.
Does she have memory issues, even though she's a mage?
Why doesn't she understand?
"Didn't we make a promise before we set out?"
"..."
"I'll handle the most difficult things, you just follow me."
"Ah..."
Marone opened her mouth, speechless, and then clenched her lips as if she had made a decision, pulling flame magic towards her hand.
And...
"Kkkkkkkk..."
I laughed, barely able to contain it, and tried to think of a positive aspect.
Yeah, at least I'm not cold anymore.
***
One hour, two hours, three hours...
As the arduous journey continued, I witnessed another side of the soldiers.
Huh, I thought they were just pufferfish.
Now I see they're little birds.
Tough little birds.
"Can you cauterize my wound with fire too?"
"Use ice magic for me. It'll probably hurt less."
They were the ones who called me a crazy bastard for cauterizing myself without potions, but they soon began mimicking my actions.
Some were even more extreme than me.
"Can you just cut this arm off?"
"...What?"
"I'm not a fool. If it rots this much, even divine power won't fix it, right? I've had no feeling in it since before."
"There, that's... Even if that's true, you should reconsider..."
"Hahaha, don't make that face. Where's the one-armed man in this world without a story? I've seen a lot of guys missing an arm, but a loss of an arm for this kind of story? That's a bargain, my friend."
Even the barbarian next to me was shocked by this cost-benefit analysis.
But maybe that was exactly why he did the math.
Finally, we were able to reach the top of the Eye of the Glacier.
"Field effect - The Eye of the Glacier is deactivated."
The moment I'd been longing for all this time.
Thud-!
The warriors, exhausted and on the verge of collapse, all fell to the ground after climbing the last hill.
Their appearance was beyond description, but their faces held the most sincere smiles they'd ever had.
"We made it…"
"Damn it, damn it, damn it… We made it, we made it…"
"What are you all doing!  Mages!  Unleash the cursed magic!  We need to heal them right now!"
The priests, who had helplessly watched their struggles to reach this point, mustered all their strength, their faces pale as if they were going to collapse themselves.
"...You've worked hard. Really."
"This arm… I don't think it's salvageable.  I'm sorry."
The priest looked apologetic at the vanguard.
"Hahaha, is that so? Don't worry about it."
"It's tough, but could you do one thing for us?"
The vanguard, laughing boisterously, asked the priests for one thing.
"Can you pray sincerely, even if it's just once? For those who couldn't make it here."
"Pray... for them?"
"Yeah, for those who died on the way."
"...Of course."
The priests knelt and clasped their hands in prayer.
The other soldiers, too busy collapsing, briefly rose and made the sign of the cross.  The dwarves, the beastfolk, the elves, and even I, who don't believe in the human god, did the same.
Even if I didn't make the sign of the cross over my chest like them.
"..."
"..."
I close my eyes, praying silently and sincerely.
My ancestral god, my guardian deity, the World Tree.
It doesn't matter who hears my voice...
"...May you rest in peace."
Please guide them to their desired resting place.
***
The expedition's current survival count is twenty-two.
Two more people died besides the summoner, Milbon Naria, while we were traversing the Eye of the Glacier.
It's a harsh environment you can't survive just by being willing to get burned or have your arm cut off.
"Matt Highbrigham."
One was a paladin, who was part of the fourth team.
"Pasible Eric Colson."
The other was a knight, who was part of the fifth team.
Wasn't he a friend and subordinate of Kaislan, who had been in the same unit for over ten years?
"Kaislan..."
"Hahaha, don't make that face. He did his duty as a soldier. It's not like he's too upset about it."
"...He's not upset?  How can you say that?"
"At least you were there, right?  So you took a step forward to survive to the very end.  That's… not a meaningless death."
"..."
"He didn't die for that royal family that abandoned us.  He died for me… and for you, as he followed in your footsteps."
"I see..."
"I'm okay, but you, you have to do what you have to do."
After the short prayer ended, we returned to what we had to do.
The priests continued to heal the warriors.
The mages were drawing magic circles on the ground.
And me...
"Wait a minute!  You can't move yet!"
"I'm fine, heal the others first."
What are you talking about? If you were really in a serious condition, you wouldn't be able to move at all.
Ignoring the priest's shout, I checked the expedition's condition.  I hadn't had time to pay attention to the rear while I was frantically carving a path forward.
"Acuraba."
I glanced around and went to where Acuraba was.
"How much food do we have left?"
"We're out."
"You must have been eating jerky well even while fighting."
"...You're the one who forced us to eat it, though?"
She's giving me some lip.
"I meant everyone did a good job."
I changed the subject.
"Where do you think those guys are now?"
"I don't know...  I'm curious too.  They were following us relentlessly, so I don't think they'd give up easily."
"I see..."
"I'll keep an eye on the Eye of the Glacier.  So rest.  If you collapse, this expedition is over..."
"Yeah..."
After talking to Acuraba, I received further healing from the priest and lay down near the entrance to the Eye of the Glacier.
"You've worked hard... old man."
The hellish time we had just experienced felt like a lie now.
Even the cold snow beneath my back felt warm.
But as always, the sweet time passed in an instant.
"Yandel! They're here!"
At the same time as Acuraba's shout, the resting soldiers all got up and stood in formation.
Pewwwwwwwww!  Booom!
A flare was fired into the space below the Eye of the Glacier.
The dark space below the cliff lit up, revealing twelve pursuers climbing the slope.
They were in better shape than I expected.
They had maintained their formation without haste while fighting the skeletons.
And they didn't have any noticeable injuries.
They must have eaten well, as they didn't seem to be gaunt either.
Unlike us, who had managed to get here with our rotten legs.
Well, it's not like I don't understand.
"Yeah, they must have arrived now because they came so comfortably."
I clenched my teeth, staring down at them.
They were looking up at us too.
With an inquisitive look.
"..."
It's obvious what they're thinking.
They must have thought it was strange that we were blocking the path in the front, but weren't wearing armor.
A smirk.
The Dragon Slayer, who was among the pursuing team, whispered something to his companions, then slightly raised the corner of his mouth and looked at me.
Is he mocking me?
If so, that's a bit funny.
"Don't they know their situation yet?"
Why did I even try to escape, to the point of discarding my equipment?
It was a decision made after carefully considering the future.
The field advantage here is greater than the equipment advantage.
"The character has entered a special area."
"Field effect - The Eye of the Glacier is bestowed."
Okay, the field effect kicks in right here.
Thud.
I stepped back, stopping at the boundary line, and smirked before shouting.
"Battle stations!!!"
Now, it's your turn to suffer.
