## Snowball (1)
A chill crept up my spine. When I opened my eyes, the surroundings were pitch black. Then, I heard it.
Beep!
A sound like a bleep emanated from somewhere. Had I heard wrong? I couldn't be sure.
I pushed myself up. It was extremely dark, but not to the point where I couldn't see anything.  The white glow emanating from a gem lying near where I had been resting illuminated the space. 
"A fragment of the record?" 
The thought crossed my mind, and I quickly picked it up. However...
"What is this? It's just a Light Gem."
It was disappointingly a common magical artifact. A simple tool that emitted light, a common replacement for torches, something any explorer would be familiar with.
Why was it here?
Despite my confusion, I raised the Light Gem high, allowing its light to spread further.
Swoosh!
As the illuminated area expanded, the surroundings became clearer.
"Character location confirmed."
A stone building with no real character. 
Unpaved streets, unlike in Raphdonia.
Every structural element was identical to the place where I had been just moments before. The only difference was that time seemed to have passed significantly.
Well, this seems to confirm that I'm back in the right place...
"But Amelia, where is she?"
Amelia wasn't here, unlike when I first arrived in the past.
Could she have woken up before me? 
Of course, I did wake up earlier than her on Parune Island.
Perhaps Amelia found this artifact and switched it on before leaving. 
If so, she would likely be close by.
"Ahem."
I cleared my throat with a few dry coughs and yelled as loudly as I could.
"Amelia!"
A barbarian's voice, blessed with steel vocal cords, would be enough to echo throughout the entire city.
However, even after waiting for several minutes, there was no response.
"..."
A silence that felt ominously heavy.
Had I returned to the original timeline alone, using the Fragment of the Record?
That possibility suddenly crossed my mind.
But…
"I should wait first."
I decided not to move recklessly and stay where I had woken up.
But waiting around was rather boring...
"Let me check my status."
I initiated a self-check.
"Information compatibility: 83%."
"Character information requires updating."
"Updating and synchronizing..."
As expected, the Essences I had consumed in the past were still intact. 
I continued to check my stats. 
I had consumed Essences but had spent most of my time at the inn.  After a day of exploring the city, I had rushed down to Noark without taking time to properly organize myself.
"Essence of the Corpse Golem has been removed from the character's soul."
"Pain Resistance decreased by -70."
"Strength decreased by -15."
"Bone Strength..."
With the decrease in Pain Resistance, my dulled senses were partially restored. 
Thanks to the +30 from the essence of the Bayon, my resistance hadn't completely vanished. Still, the absence of 70 stats was noticeable even during normal activities.
It wasn't a big issue though. My stats were substantially improved overall, excluding Pain Resistance. 
To summarize:
"Essence of Ball-Herchan has permeated the character's soul."
"Physical Resistance increased by +70."
"Natural Regeneration increased by +40."
"Poison Resistance increased by +120..."
Physical Resistance, Natural Regeneration. 
Two essential stats for a tank, along with Poison Resistance.
Although Strength hadn't been boosted, I had a superior stat that could compensate for it.
"Muscle Mass increased by +15."
Muscle Mass.
An ultra-rare stat that could only be obtained from a few monsters ranked 3rd grade or higher. 
Its effect is simple.
For every point of Muscle Mass, the total Strength value increases by 1%.
"With my current stats, that's 20%, which means my Strength is slightly over 60..."
Coupled with Stamina +30, Vision +20, and Bone Strength +80,  I had gained a significant boost in my total stats just from one Essence.
Conversely, I had some stats that were reduced.
"Agility decreased by -30."
"Flexibility decreased by -50."
"Synchronization complete."
"Resuming character log transmission."
Surprisingly, the decrease in Flexibility was more noticeable than the decrease in Agility. 
Should I say my body had become much stiffer?
The reduction in Flexibility alone had restricted some movements that were previously possible.
My Agility had also decreased, making my actions slower.
"Well, considering what I gained, this level of penalty is insignificant."
While stats are important, the biggest advantage of Ball-Herchan's essence lies in its skills.
(P) Evolving Carapace —  Gains a constant bonus status proportional to the Physical Resistance stat.
First, the passive skill, Evolving Carapace.
This skill grants additional effects when the Physical Resistance stat reaches 70, 350, 750, or 1,500.
The first level effect is as follows:
"Character's Physical Resistance stat is 70 or higher."
"Gain a 50% resistance to swords."
That's what I call Swordproof.
This is also why this essence is specifically for countering Aura.
Aura is always classified as a sword.
With just this one skill, the insane 90% physical penetration is reduced to 45%.
"Anyway, the second level requires activating 'Gigantification'..."
The third level should be unlocked by consuming just one more essence when I'm fully boosted.  As for the fourth level, it's best for my mental well-being to forget about it for now.
Most multiplier buffs have limits.
For example, [Rapture], the Orc Shaman's skill that increases Physical Resistance by 3 times for 10 seconds, doesn't increase above 300, even when your Physical Resistance is over 300.
"But… is she really not around?"
I checked my character's status and spent some time, but I was starting to feel anxious about waiting for Amelia.
It had been almost two hours, although I couldn't tell the exact time.  But I still couldn't hear a single sign of life around me.
"Tsk, this can't be right..."
There was no logical explanation.
When I opened my eyes, this Light Gem was already emitting light. 
Whether it was Amelia or someone else, the person who activated this artifact should be nearby.
"... I should have a look around."
Staying put was foolish, considering the possibility of us missing each other.  I used the Light Gem to illuminate the area and slowly began to walk.
Thinking about it, I had another question.
"This city being completely empty is also odd, isn't it?"
In the past, Noark's residents escaped outside the city walls to avoid the Royal family's invasion. And the Royal army took over the city.
But what about now?
It's so quiet that I can't even hear ants crawling.
"Could it be..."
An ominous thought crossed my mind.  But it wasn't the time to jump to conclusions.
I decided to focus on what I could do immediately.
For instance, finding something to cover myself with.
Kwang!
I entered the nearest inn and dusted off a tablecloth. Then, I wrapped it around my waist.
There's no way I'd find clothes that fit me.
"At least I look a bit more civilized now."
I felt a bit more human, but as they say, human greed has no limits.
"... Is there any food around?"
After taking care of shelter, I felt a pang of hunger. I checked every room, searching through drawers and cabinets. 
These inns are often used by explorers, so I was sure to find some preserved food to satisfy my hunger.
"This isn't even a post-apocalyptic setting."
It was strange to find food in a building that was practically an abandoned house.
"Well… I should have a look around again."
I had eaten something, so I left the building and wandered around the eerily silent city.
How much time had passed?
I arrived at the empty Dimensional Plaza and saw a tent in my field of vision.
"Royal…?"
A military tent with the Royal family's crest prominently displayed. 
It was probably set up by the army that occupied Noark...
Swoosh.
There was no sign of life anywhere. I cautiously pushed aside the canvas and peeked inside.
Could it be that they took everything with them as they retreated?
The tent was filled with dust except for a large desk. And…
"This is messed up…"
That was my biggest problem.
I had already discarded the possibility that time had stopped in this place after I traveled to the past, the moment I saw the city had become a ghost town.
"But I never thought the ratio wasn't 1:1."
I used my index finger to dust the dusty desk.
Almost two centimeters of dust came off.
Considering the environment here, that's not the amount of dust that would accumulate in just six months.
"... What year is it even?"
Just as an ominous feeling was becoming a reality and sending shivers down my spine, I heard it.
"Finally…"
A familiar voice came from behind me.
I instinctively turned around, and there she was—the face I had been longing to see.
"Amelia!"
Amelia Rainwailz. 
The SSR-level companion I had managed to recruit by traveling back 20 years.
Thank goodness. I wasn't the only one who had returned.
Did she really wake up first and go somewhere?
"Where have you been? I thought you were gone…"
I was trying to talk to her out of pure joy, but I froze.
I had to.
"What is this…? What are those gears?"
Amelia was completely different from me, who had just woken up with nothing but my bare body. She was fully equipped with what looked like custom-made armor.
"Is it possible to farm this kind of gear just because you woke up a little earlier?"
Just as I was feeling a sense of alienation, she grabbed my wrist roughly. 
"... Let's talk while we walk, but follow me!"
***
What if…
The door of a car that suddenly drifted into your lane opened, and someone yelled for you to get in?
What would you do?
My answer was 'YES'.
"There's a reason for this."
Even if it were an unknown person, I would hesitate.  But this was a companion.
Of course, it's wise to follow what they say.
Therefore…
"Huff, huff…!"
It's a bit abrupt, but we're sprinting through the dark streets. 
And I'm using all my strength to keep up with Amelia's pace.
I can't lie, I'm curious.
But I can ask while I run.
"Amelia…! What's going on? Give me an explanation, even a short one!"
Amelia replied very briefly to my question.
"There's a pursuer."
"A pursuer?"
"One of the Seven Strong, the Blood Spirit Lord."
"What?"
"I'm sorry. This is my fault. I never thought she would grow strong enough to sense me and track me this quickly..."
My mind was in chaos.
I didn't understand a single thing.
What are the Seven Strong, anyway? 
And who's the Blood Spirit Lord?
There were many questions, but time was limited.
So I checked the most important thing first.
"Is she that strong, that even we can't beat her?"
"Yes. If we clash directly, it would be my defeat."
"What?  What kind of a person—" 
"... You wouldn't know, of course. It was before she made a contract with the Spirit King and ran wild."
Then Amelia turned to me while running.
"Erwen Fornachi Di Tercia."
"... Huh?"
"She is the owner of the current pure blood and the contractor of the Ninth Spirit King.  That's her name."
My mind went blank.
Pure blood? Spirit King?
"... Erwen?"
She's become that strong?
No, but…
"How much time has passed—?" 
The question slipped out of my mouth.
Did she hear my quiet mutter even while running?
Amelia answered in a sad voice.
"Two years and six months."
"..."
"It's been two years and six months since you were declared dead."
This is insane…
