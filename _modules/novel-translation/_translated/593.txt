## The Third Record (1)
We entered the boss room by riding the Guardian Statues. I called it a rift, since I didn’t have a better word, but technically, it wasn’t a rift. The mages said that the rift portal lacked any of its characteristic properties, and I just shrugged it off. After all, the other side of the portal was just a boss room, unlike normal rifts. However…
“This is a real rift…,” I thought. Beyond the stone door that had opened after conquering all the Guardian Statues, a rift portal appeared. “Well, the first basement floor is also a stage by itself,” I rationalized. Perhaps the rift portal was inherent to this floor? That wasn’t unheard of. Although the village chief had advised me not to get my hopes up, since he hadn't witnessed the formation of a rift in his long life…
“There’s no way it doesn’t exist,” I thought, dismissing his skepticism.  It’s not uncommon for rifts to open only in certain locations rather than randomly. This seemed like another such case.
"Be careful! If you get sucked in, there's no turning back!"
"Any readings on the portal's energy fluctuations?"
While the mages huddled around the portal, gathering data, I moved away and organized my thoughts. “I thought there might be rifts on the sixth floor or above…,” I mused. My expectations, which I had been quietly nurturing, had been spectacularly dashed. “No, it’s too early to say that?” Perhaps this portal would randomly transport us to one of the higher rifts. “I doubt it, though,” I conceded, my gamer’s intuition contradicting my rational thoughts. My gut told me that this portal led to a unique rift, a one-of-a-kind rift specific to the first basement floor.
“Ugh…,” I sighed. Rather than curiosity or anticipation, I felt a deep sense of unease. This wasn’t a game. There were no retries here. We had to succeed on our first try in an unknown rift, with no information about the Guardians, the monsters, or the terrain. 
“…Yandell?" 
“Ah… Emily.”
Amelia, sensing my anxiety, sent me a worried glance.  But she merely handed me a water pouch instead of speaking.
How much time had passed? The mages gathered for a briefing, sharing their findings. Excluding the trivial details, there were two main points.
"We didn't observe any decrease in magic density from the rift portal. The possibility of it naturally disappearing over time appears extremely low."
We had ample time to consider our options before entering the rift. This meant we didn’t need to rush into forming teams. It was an expected outcome, but hearing it confirmed still provided some relief. However…
“Based on our observations, we believe the rift can only accommodate a maximum of five people.” 
This part was a surprise. I was surprised by the limit, but even more surprised by how they reached that conclusion. Could they determine such a thing through investigation? That wasn’t the case in the game.
I pressed them for details on the investigation process, only to receive an underwhelming answer.
“Well, we found murals on the inner surface of the stone door. After extensive discussions within our team, we concluded that they signified the total capacity.”
As it turned out, they hadn't used magic to determine this, it was just an educated guess. 
"Of course, we understand the possibility of this interpretation being inaccurate, as it was based on our subjective observation. We ask for your understanding in this matter."
"What the hell is this mage rambling about?" 
"………Yes?"
Damn, I blurted it out.  The atmosphere instantly turned chilly, but I didn’t offer any excuses or apologies. It wasn’t something a Barbarian would do. In essence, they were simply saying that their assumption could be wrong, so they wanted to hedge their bets.
“Let’s adjourn the meeting for now. I have something to discuss with the Baron. Would everyone please excuse us?” 
The village chief, understanding my silent plea, dismissed everyone. Once we were alone, he asked me, "What would you like to do?" 
Like during the Statue Exploration, he was willing to delegate all exploration decisions to me. 
“The mages’ interpretation holds some merit, so I plan to form a team of five.  Of course, I intend to prepare additional teams in case of emergency.” 
“A wise decision. Once you have selected your team, let me know —”
“There’s something I’d like to ask you.”
I interrupted him, and the village chief stared at me intently. His gaze, impossible to read, sent a shiver down my spine. 
“Go on.”
With his permission, I asked without hesitation, “Would you consider joining the rift with us?”
“Why?”
A half-hearted lie wouldn’t fool him. After some contemplation, I laid out my honest thoughts. “You’re practically dead, anyway.” 
He’d be the perfect scout.

First friend, first love, first heartbreak…
First experiences are always special and unforgettable.  And it was no different for me. My first rift.  Even though I’d entered rifts countless times during my [Dungeon and Stone] playthrough, I still vividly recall the first time I challenged each rift.
Blood Fortress, Glacier Cave, White Temple…
Rift after rift, with no prior information.  I carefully navigated the challenges, but 99% of the time, I ended up staring at a game over screen, having lost my carefully cultivated character. 
Hammer Dwarf, Sniper Elf, Beastkin Voodoo Witch…
They were all just data fragments that vanished because I lacked knowledge.  Now, I don’t feel any regret. But these experiences instilled a realization within me. It’s natural to get wiped out in your first rift.  That is, unless you’re clearly over-leveled. But…
“Considering the first basement floor’s difficulty, I don’t think we’re over-leveled,” I thought.
This made the village chief’s recruitment a critical matter. He was one of the strongest players, Jerome Saintred. We could use him however we wanted.
“Besides, if I die, it’ll benefit you as well, wouldn’t it?”
“…That’s going a bit far.” 
I mumbled, trying to conceal my awkwardness, but couldn’t deny the truth. Was that a refusal? Should I just give up? I was seriously considering it when…
"I'll do it." 
“….What?”
"If you agree to one favor, that is."
"Tell me."
Surprisingly, the village chief’s request wasn’t anything special. His intentions were transparent.
“I want you to hold onto a few things for me until we reach the city and then return them.”
“…You want me to deliver Karui’s Heart. It’s impossible to take it out of this dungeon because of the [Pagan Altar’s] effect."
“Correct.”
That was one of the most prominent features of the [Pagan Altar]. You have to register your equipment on the altar periodically. If you die and resurrect, your equipment will be restored.
“Hmm…,” I pondered.
“There’s no real disadvantage to you, is there?”
“That’s true, but I’m curious why you’d trust me with that request.” 
I asked directly, and the village chief chuckled, a little less awkwardly this time. 
“Ha ha, the one who handed over the body of the Exploration Army commander, entrusted by the royal family, to a monster, was you. How could I not trust you?”
He was basically saying that I’d be the one to suffer if I broke my promise. 
“Let me warn you. This is the last time blackmail like this will work. You better be careful.”
“Why is this blackmail? I haven’t forced you to make a promise. I simply told you what would happen if you broke it. If you don’t like it, just refuse my offer.” 
Well, logically, that was true. I was speechless. I calmly ended the conversation.
“….I’ll assume we’re going together.  I’ll start assembling the team.”
"Very well.  But... are you not leaving?"
"Why would I? I'll have to tell you this again later, so it's a waste of time."
"...As you wish."
I settled back in my chair and began contemplating who else to include. "Two members are decided…,” I thought. The village chief and me. If the mages are right, we have room for three more members. Who should we take?
"We should take a mage and a priest, right?"
A mage’s versatility and a priest’s stability are essential for any team. 
My first choice wasn’t difficult.
"Gahyeon Besillus. We'll bring that old man for the mage slot."
He was the head mage of the first Exploration Army.  We had a bit of a disagreement in the past. 
“Hmm… I’m surprised.”
"Surprised by what?"
Gahyeon Besillus, the current leader of a magic school, had served as a military mage for a long time in his youth. He had vast experience in exploration, and his skills are beyond question. They say he even led the Grade 1 combined magic I saw before.
“Honestly, I thought you’d choose that mage girl.”
“Ah, Raven?” 
“Yes.”
Raven was indeed a candidate. She is knowledgeable about dungeons and possesses decent skills. She’s also more passionate about exploring unknown rifts than the old man. However…
“This isn’t a children’s game. We have a better mage available, why would I choose another option?”
The village chief simply nodded in agreement.
“You care a lot about your companions, don’t you?”
“….Did you even hear what I said?”
“About how it doesn't matter if you die?”
“….  ”
He’s becoming more and more slick with every passing day.
“Who are the other two candidates?”
“First, I need a priest.”
While Sven Parav, the paladin, was considered, I quickly dismissed the idea.  The village chief and I alone are enough for the front line. In terms of healing or utility, paladins can’t compete with priests.  
Sven might have a crazy intuition, but…
“It’s a useless ability unless we have no other choice,” I thought.  It’s better to have the power to overcome a crisis than just sensing it. We all face dead ends at some point.
“If you’re looking for a priest, this guy is a good choice.”
“Who is it?”
“The Archbishop of the Leathralas Church.”
I thought the archbishop was a good choice, and he got the priest slot. 
Now, the coveted remaining slot. “We need a damage dealer,” I thought. If the village chief goes down during the exploration, the mage will be the only one who can deal damage.  We need reinforcements in the damage dealing department.
“….There’s no better choice, no matter how I think about it.”
After much deliberation, I finally decided on the last member.  It was a pity, but…
"The last slot goes to my companion, Erwen Pornach di Tercia." 
There was no damage dealer in the entire Exploration Army who could replace Erwen. 
***
To prepare for any eventuality, I selected everyone else besides the five members of the advance party.  I gathered all five selected members together.  We needed to get to know each other better before venturing in, right?  
“We can’t change members once we’re inside, so we need to get to know each other well,” I thought.
The final lineup could change depending on the interview results.
"I am Eden Hesthaia. I may be lacking, but I somehow ended up as the Archbishop of the Leathralas Church.”
“Nice to meet you. This is my first time talking to you personally.”
"I've heard a lot about the Baron from Sir Parav. I'll be in your care inside."
Archbishop Eden Hesthaia impressed me more than I expected.  I had seen him bossing around Sir Parav, so I honestly thought he was a grumpy old man. 
“I'm ashamed to say, I don't know much about dungeons. I hope the Baron will guide and lead us.”
"I will. What holy spells can you use?"
"Ha ha, I can cast any spell the Baron might know — "
“Oh, so you can do Star of Origin?  ”
“…..The Baron seems quite knowledgeable about holy spells. Star of Origin is difficult.”
“Is that right?  That’s a shame. Then, how about Star Summon?”
“Ah, I can do that.”
We went through a proper grilling session, and ultimately, the priest didn’t need to be replaced. He really was a skilled priest.
Anyway, next was the mage.
“Gahyeon, tell me all the magic you can cast.”
Gahyeon Besillus complained about why he had to do it, but my next words made him sigh and surrender.
“If we fail, over a hundred people who follow us will die.”
“It will take a long time, so I’ll only tell you about spells Grade 3 or above."
"What about the rest?" 
“I can handle them all, except for unique spells."
Wow, this is pretty impressive.  Perhaps they selected the best of the best, even among those chosen by the royal family? His level was beyond my expectations. A dream team, if you will.
“This is going to be amazing…,” I thought.
After introducing our skills, we gave a crash course to the Archbishop and Gahyeon on positioning and things to watch out for during the exploration.  They had almost no experience with smaller-scale explorations involving five people or fewer.  There was a lot to cover, but…
"There’s no time limit, anyway," I thought.
We stayed there for a few days, stuffing them with knowledge and double, triple-checking their personalities. Finally, we were ready today. 
"Go first, Yandell. If the portal doesn’t disappear, we’ll follow right behind you. And Tercia."
"...Why?"
"If we can’t follow you in…."
"I know. I’ll protect you."
"...Right."
Who’s protecting who? I laughed as I bid farewell to the other members. The village chief approached me.
Woooosh!
I couldn’t be sure what kind of danger lurked on the other side of the portal. 
"Done with your farewells?"
It was almost time to enter.
