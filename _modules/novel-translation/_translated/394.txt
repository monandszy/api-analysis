## Chapter 394: Captain Barbarian (4)
The reason I chose to fight all four at once was simple. Even if I defeated them all in a one-on-one tournament, they wouldn't be convinced. I judged that this was the only way to make them all see reason. 
To throw them a meal they couldn't resist swallowing without having to be devoured themselves.
“Oh, and just so you know, if I lose, I'll gracefully give up the leader position.”
An opportunity to eliminate one competitor from the stage.
“But why is everyone so quiet? Are you four perhaps not confident in defeating me even if you all attack together?”
My taunt finally drew a response from the other side.
“I’m in favor.”
“What? Even so, we wouldn’t be that reckless against one person—”
“If he’s willing to take the fall, why would we oppose it?”
“Akuraba senior’s words are right.”
The dwarf woman’s statement was seconded by the vice-captain, and a consensus began to form. The knight nodded, albeit reluctantly, while the paladin remained silent, signifying his agreement.
They know, don't they?
It might be a bit ridiculous to tell others, but this is a chance to easily get rid of one competitor.
“You’re Rihen Shuits, right?”
“So?”
“You have to keep the promise you made a while ago.”
“Of course. If I lose, I'll make one of you the leader without a word. But—”
“You want a confirmation for the opposite scenario, too, right? Okay. If, by any chance, you manage to defeat all of us, you’ll get the position you want.”
After that, I demanded confirmation from the other three, excluding Akuraba, and in an instant, the verbal agreement was concluded. 
While it wasn't put into writing, there's a witness more reliable than anything, so you can rest assured.
“Then that’s settled. Marquis, do you have a suitable place?”
“Of course.”
The Marquis readily gave us the training ground of his mansion, as if he wasn't worried about me at all. It's unlikely he trusts me 100%. He probably decided he could gain something if I were to fail through arrogance.
For instance, he might use this failure as a reason to interfere in everything I do.
“Alright, I’ll be waiting outside then.”
Upon arriving at the training ground, I donned my gear.
“Character equipped with a large adamantium combat shield.”
“Total item level increases by +1,750.”
Starting with the shield I had repurchased for a hefty sum after returning from the past.
“Character equipped with a steel breastplate.”
“Total item level increases by +150.”
“Character equipped with steel greaves.”
“Total item level increases by +75.”
“Character equipped with war boots.”
“Total item level increases by +45.”
Those cheap gears I had to settle for back then, because I didn't have enough money. Phew, now that I have money, I should replace them all with adamantium or something.
“Character equipped with No. 87 Kraul’s Devil Crusher.”
“Total item level increases by +4,800.”
Finally fully equipped with my hammer, I stepped out onto the training ground. Soon, the four men and women who had finished preparing began to appear one by one.
“Isn’t it strange? I find this more comfortable than clothes these days.”
“It means your body has adapted. You’ve been wearing this more than everyday clothes, after all.”
The gears, their colors all so expensive. However, despite careful maintenance, signs of wear and tear and frayed joints around the knees were noticeable.
I paid close attention to their gear.
‘Oh my, they all came fully equipped with jewelry I haven’t seen before.’
Yeah, even if they came in formal attire, I knew they had their equipment in their spatial pockets. 
They’d have no right to call themselves explorers otherwise.
“But that one… it’s a bit different from what I expected.”
“I heard he’s the Blood Queen’s man. Does she not even buy him armor?”
“Rihen Shuits, do you really intend to fight with that equipment?”
The four men and women looked at me with strange expressions as they saw my simple steel gear. Their gaze felt more like estrangement than scorn.
Well, it’s no surprise they didn’t expect me, someone who had been introduced by the Marquis, to be this inadequate.
“No problem.”
What’s so great about steel armor? It's not a significant variable in this fight. Well, honestly, with all those eyes on me, I felt a bit embarrassed and my PTSD might have resurfaced… 
But it’s not a big deal if you think about it.
“Alright, come at me.”
Common sense dictates that the person with a shattered skull is the more embarrassing sight, right?
***
There’s a saying that a battle of masters is decided in a split second. I disagree with that statement. Maybe it’s true for a duel between maxed-out damage dealers, but I'm a true tank, aren't I? My true worth shines in prolonged battles.
However… 
At least the start of this battle wasn’t drastically different from the battle between masters I had imagined.
“······.”
The conversation vanished at some point. The distance between us, the heavy tension as our gazes locked, the drooping eyelids with a decreased blinking frequency. 
Muscles honed through countless battles were tensing, ready to unleash optimal strength at any moment. Sweat started to form on my hands gripping the weapon.
And then… 
Swish.
A sense of alertness even to the slightest movements. One of the reasons why a one-on-many battle is so difficult. There’s simply too much to keep track of.
So, maybe it’s better to… 
“How long are you going to keep standing there?”
I posed the question. The moment they tried to answer, I used their breath as a window, pushing off the ground and dashing forward. My first target was the knight who was standing at the forefront with the most aggression.
“······!”
The knight narrowed his eyes, clearly embarrassed to have been targeted first…
Whoooooosh-!
The aura of a master swordsman, honed to perfection, instantly enveloped the blade as it swung towards me. An aura that must have sliced through countless heavily-armored enemies, be it in the labyrinth or the city.
“Character activated [Iron Fortress].”
“[Evolutionary Shell] effect increases by 1.5 times.”
I raised my shield to block.
Clack!
The knight, startled, looked at me with surprise as the sword bounced off instead of slicing through as usual. However, as a seasoned soldier, the time he was caught off guard was extremely short.
Whiz-bang-!
He used the rebound force to spin in mid-air and swung his sword again. This time, he aimed for my lower body, which was difficult to block with a shield. Specifically, it was the calf, where my steel greaves protected my skin.
‘Did he figure out the adamantium was the issue?’
It was incredibly fast for a judgment made after only one exchange. The problem is that it was the wrong guess.
Clack!
Oh, so you think steel is nothing?
The opponent had already exhausted a lot of energy for his large movements, leaving many openings.  I used my foot to launch a kick at the knight’s chin.
Kwaang-!
The body flew up into the air from the impact. The perfect angle for a hammer blow—
“Jun Arschen activated [Light of Protection].”
Damn it.
Kwaaang-!
The divine spell that was cast in time unfolded semi-transparently above the knight’s head, blocking my hammer blow. 
The knight retreated in the brief opening.
“How…?”
He was still obsessed with the question, even after barely surviving.
Knights are all the same, aren’t they?
‘…I guess steel armor is surprising when it can block an aura?’
It’s true, you know. There’s a saying that becoming a masterpiece is more important than wearing a masterpiece.
“His gear seems ordinary at a glance.”
“So that means the anomaly is the person.”
That's correct. Not only does [Union] add additional physical resistance to the equipment, but it also applies the effects of [Evolutionary Shell] and [Iron Skin].  Of course, the adamantium shield is pristine while the steel armor has deep scratches on it.
“No matter what essence he's consumed, blocking an aura… it wasn’t just reckless bravado.”
Akuraba and the vice-captain exchanged opinions quickly, watching me from the rear, relatively far from the battlefield.
“I have a few guesses. I don’t know how it applies to the weapons, but Kala, why don't you attack him with an arrow?”
Kala, wearing matching dragon leather armor, drew the bowstring at Akuraba’s command. 
Could it be that they already know about my sword resistance?
“James Kala activated [Piercing Light].”
The moment the light gathered on the arrowhead, I tucked myself inside my shield for protection. 
Because it's already too late if you try to block it with your eyes. 
Whizz-!
The light arrow shot out with a short flash. Because I managed to block it in time, there was no damage. But…
“The arrowhead is stuck.”
The adamantium shield, which had been completely unscratched even by aura, had a deep hole where the arrowhead penetrated.
Akuraba quickly shared the information.
“He can’t be harmed by a sword.”
Phew, I’ll lose everything if—
Kwaang-!
The paladin blocked my path, continuing his charge forward after pushing the knight away earlier. 
His main weapons are a large shield and a mace. Yeah, that’s the core combo for a tank.
Kwaaang-!
The paladin used his shield as a wall to block me, trying to stop my advance rather than using his weapon.
Ziiiik.
His base strength wasn’t very high, so his feet dragged on the ground as he was pushed back. 
He didn’t get very far, unfortunately.
“Jun Arschen activated [Divine Release].”
“Jun Arschen activated [Overflowing Power].”
“Jun Arschen activated [Sun’s Blessing].”
As expected of the paladin, the epitome of buff-and-self-heal tanks, he activated various divine spells, causing white light to erupt from his body. 
And then…
“Amazing strength.”
He complimented me, standing his ground and not getting pushed back even a bit.
Damn, insulting.
Well, I’ve reached the distance I wanted, so it’s okay?
“Character activated [Transcendence].”
“Character activated [Eye of the Storm].”
My own grab skill that works best in PvP. The maximum range is 20 meters, but the reason I closed the distance like this is simple. The shorter the distance, the more difficult it is to react, right?
Whiz-bang-whizz-!
A strong gust of wind erupted in the peaceful atmosphere.
“Ugh…!”
My target was the vice-captain in the rear. It’s the common tactic in one-on-many combat to target the backline first…
‘He’s wearing that kind of armor, I just want to rip it off.’
Drake leather has excellent demon resistance, but it’s vulnerable to physical strength. In other words, one hit is enough to make him near death.
“Character activated [Gigantification].”
“Character’s physique increases, and threat and physique stats increase in proportion to the size.”
I used the skill I had been saving up for so long, pushing the paladin away with my increased strength.
And then… 
Thud.
I jumped towards the archer who was flying in with the wind, taking advantage of the extra reach granted by [Gigantification]. I brought my hammer down before the archer could even react.
“Jun Arschen activated [Light of Protection].”
Well, the paladin, who had missed me earlier, cast the same divine spell that saved the knight. But…
“Character used a transformation ability.”
“[Primordial Cell] effect reduces the spiritual energy consumption of the skill by half, and the highest stat increases by 1.5 times.”
The results were bound to be different from before. 
Because it was just a normal attack earlier, right?
“Character activated [Swing].”
“Blunt weapon’s power increases drastically in proportion to the strength stat.”
My only attack skill, [Swing].
Kwa-zi-zi-zi-zi-zi-ik-!
The moment the hammer made contact, the barrier shattered like glass.
Kwa-zi-ik-!
The vice-captain sprayed blood from the shattered part of his forehead as he collapsed to the ground.
One knight, one tank.
Even with the 9th-tier explorer Akuraba, they couldn't prevent the unfortunate incident.
“······.”
I quietly counted the numbers in the uncomfortable silence.
“One down.”
Three remain.
***
Four high-tier explorers. Hmm, should I exclude the knight?
‘The real battle starts now.’
While I had easily eliminated one of the four masters, I didn't let my guard down; I was bracing myself. This was a pure early advantage. 
I had learned a lot about them from the Marquis, but they knew very little about me.
“······.”
The situation was ironic in a way.
The vice-captain, who was not killed but suffered serious injuries and lost consciousness. The one who preached about “information power” in the dining room earlier was the first to be knocked out due to a lack of information.
‘Well, saying he's completely out is a bit of an exaggeration.’
[Dungeon and Stone] is a world where resurrection is possible as long as you don't die.
“Jun Arschen activated [Regeneration Touch].”
White light emanated from the paladin’s body and flowed towards the unconscious vice-captain.
It’s not like a shield barbarian has a cancel skill, so it was already inevitable that he would eventually recover and regain consciousness. But…
‘Short battles won’t do.’
I abandoned the idea of finishing this fight before he recovered, even if that meant pouring everything I had into it.  I never expected such an overwhelming victory in the first place.
After all, even with a well-matched combination, is it even reasonable for a single person to crush four top-tier explorers? 
Everything comes with a price. That is the only truth of this cruel world. Therefore…
“Woo-aaa-aaa-aaa-aaa-aaa-aaa!!!”
I charged forward, swinging my hammer.
Kwaang.
The paladin blocked me.
Whoooooosh-!
Someone flew up behind me, swinging a weapon. 
It was the knight who had been knocked away earlier. He was holding a blunt weapon instead of a sword.
It’s a bit strange to see a knight using a normal weapon instead of an aura… 
But that's also characteristic of high-tier masters. Adjusting your actions based on the situation.
Kwaaang-!
The blunt weapon slammed into my shoulder.
The physical impact wasn’t that severe, but the moment I was hit, a burning sensation ran through my bones. The reason was obvious.
‘What kind of weapon is he carrying for swapping?’
No. 761 Roam’s Furnace Hammer.
A triple-number item. Its effect adds a fiery piercing damage proportional to physical strength.
But thanks to my fire resistance, I can still endure it.
“Woo-aaa-aaa-aaa-aaa-aaa-aaa-!”
I activated [Wild Burst], using the temporary increase in my physical stats to kick the paladin further away—
‘What, why isn’t he moving?’
My brain, marinated in [Dungeon and Stone] for 20 years, found the answer simultaneously with the question.
“Jun Arschen activated [Divine Form].”
Of course, he already activated that, huh.
‘As expected, it’s not easy.’
It seems they abandoned all caution after one of them fell. It will be difficult to maintain physical superiority against the paladin for a while…
“Titana Akuraba used [No. 1911 Paveller’s Broken Pocket Watch].”
The dwarf woman, who had been observing the situation, finally joined the battle. 
She’s an offensive ability user, by the way. In a race that uses Number items like a necessity, she’s in a position as efficient as warriors.
“Cooldown time is negated for 5 minutes.”
For example, that pocket watch is an item that only Dwarves can use with a complete cooldown negation. It’s normally just a 70% cooldown reduction for non-Dwarves. 
She’s a 9th-tier, huh. She must have all the core items, besides that watch.
So what was her main skill again?
“Titana Akuraba activated [Vampiric Spike].”
Ah, that’s right! It has low MP consumption, decent damage, and MP absorption, but it’s a 2nd-tier skill with a cooldown, which is why it’s not that highly rated. 
Whiz-bang-!
The giant spike flies towards me. I’d usually dodge, but the paladin and the other knight are blocking my sides. 
Kwaang-!
So I just blocked it with my shield. 
Even though she’s an ability user, that kind of skill is classified as pure physical damage.  My arm is a bit sore, but it's not unbearable.
The problem is that I’m open on my sides because I blocked it.
The moment I opened up an opportunity, the paladin and the knight slammed me with their blunt weapons.
Kwaang-!
One burned my entire body instantly.
Kwaang—!
The other just penetrated my physical resistance and hit my bones. Well, with [Divine Form], his strength is probably twice mine. 
‘Right, defense is a lost cause.’
I made a quick decision. 
If you get hit twice when you block one hit… 
It’s better to get hit three times and hit back once.  
Plus, thanks to my 7th-tier engraving, my natural regeneration is pretty decent now.
Kwaang-!
I used my shield to block large attacks and swung my hammer.
The remaining three, sensing the threat, unleashed the skills they hadn’t used yet, closing in on me.
And in the midst of it all…
“Wake up and grab your bow!”
The vice-captain returned to battle after being healed.
Kwaang-!
My shield held up better than my steel armor, which had a low base durability, and it showed damage in several places.
Whizz-!
Pff!
Arrows were piercing those damaged parts, and my injuries were increasing.
Waaa-ak-!
After being hit by the Furnace Hammer so many times, my resistance, which was initially bearable, is now burning like hell.
Kwaang-!
The paladin’s mace blow feels like my bones are shattering every time.
Ah, maybe my bones were actually shattering and regenerating in real time?
Well, that must have been the case.
But…
“You’re laughing?”
I laughed even harder. I expected this level of difficulty, after all.
Pffff!
I sprayed blood like a fountain from my mouth, where blood had accumulated after being hit by the hammer and biting my tongue. 
It’s a shame that I no longer produce acidic blood, but it still obscures my vision.
“…You’re a monster.”
“I guess I have to admit it. You're definitely stronger than me.”
As we were in the middle of this dogfight, the knight muttered something.
“But even you can’t handle four at once. Just give up already.”
What the hell. 
I can see they’re all panting because they’re exhausted, but I still have a lot of MP left, you know?
“Character activated [Spiritual Dive].”
“Spiritual energy regenerates in proportion to the amount consumed.”
My MP, which had almost reached zero, instantly replenished.
The battle continued, and how long did it go on afterwards?
“Why… aren’t you collapsing?”
The knight, who had suggested giving up earlier, finally asked the question.
“You must have drunk from the Spring of Origin, like the one in the Bible.”
The paladin murmured in agreement.
“Stop it already. You know you can’t win, don’t you?”
The dwarf woman was tired of my stubbornness.
“Let’s just pretend this didn’t happen. We can’t keep our promise anymore.”
The archer seemed to wish this excruciating battle would end soon.
But…
“You… suddenly became, so talkative.”
The more they tried to convince me to give up, the more I focused on one thing.
“Are you nervous? Nervous that, you’ll lose?”
What I can do. What I need to do now.
And…
“Please, just fall already!”
What I’ve always been best at.
“Titana Akuraba activated [Vampiric Spike].”
“James Kala activated [Piercing Light].”
“Jun Arschen activated [Regeneration Touch].”
I persisted, endured, and kept enduring until the moment finally arrived.
“Skill cancelled due to insufficient spiritual energy.”
“Skill cancelled due to insufficient spiritual energy.”
“Skill cancelled due to insufficient divine power.”
In the end, the one who stands last is the strongest.
