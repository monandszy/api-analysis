## Chapter 675: Dream (2)
The powerful current surged through my body, yet my impossibly heavy form continued its vertical descent.  Even amidst the blurry, alcohol-soaked haze of my consciousness, a thought emerged. 
"Is this the end?" 
Was this all that remained of my long, arduous journey? 
"No way."
I couldn't succumb to sleep. I had to regain consciousness and ascend. I tried to swim upwards, fueled by this desperate desire, but…
*Swoosh.*
My body refused to respond, as if I had become deaf.  
I couldn't fall asleep. Not now.  If I did, something terrible would happen. Despite these thoughts, a part of me surrendered.
"I don't care…"
My strength was failing.  Surely Lee Baek-ho and the others on the ship would find me. 
Yes, of course, they would.
So…
"Just let me… sleep…"
As I loosened my grip on the frayed threads of consciousness, a sudden surge of light erupted.
*Whoosh* 
The darkness before my eyes, engulfing me as I sank beneath the surface, transformed into a blinding white. 
Simultaneously, a piercing ringing filled my ears.
*BEEEEP*
The light and the ringing felt like a searing brand against my brain, forcing me awake.
*Click, clack, click, clack.*
Footsteps approached from somewhere.  With great effort, I lifted my eyelids, and a human figure gradually drew closer.
Her skin was pale, as if she had swallowed a ghost. In her hand, she clutched a tattered doll of indeterminate origin. A young girl, seemingly no older than ten, with brown hair that cascaded to her shoulders. 
Despite my clouded mind, I instantly recognized her.
"Alice Groundia…"
The Earth Witch I had encountered at the cabin.
"Why are you here...?"
I tried to speak, but no sound emerged. The Earth Witch, as if hearing my voice nonetheless, gazed at me with a gentle smile.  
Then...
"I'll make your dream come true." 
Her voice was a mesmerizing blend of allure and a strange sense of imploration.
"So…" 
Her eyes, fathomless pools of mystery, locked onto mine. 
"Don't come back."
These were the final images I recall.
***
"Huff…!"
I drew in a deep breath, as if I had just escaped from drowning.  I raised my upper body, only to…
*Shudder.*
My body froze. This time, not for physical reasons, but because of the terror that gripped my mind.
"…Thin."
I looked at my hand, opening and closing it several times. I stared blankly at my surroundings before closing my eyes. 
As always, I needed time.  A minimum amount of time to comprehend this situation.
*Throb.*
My physical state was abysmal. The boundless energy I typically felt was entirely gone. It was like I had been drowning in alcohol, waking up with a splitting headache.  
Furthermore…
*Swoosh.*
The room I saw when I opened my eyes remained unchanged.
"This is…" 
This place, familiar beyond any description. 
"My room."
Lee Han-soo's room.
Why had I awakened here? 
Could it be that the Ghostbusters server had reopened?
This thought briefly crossed my mind, but…
"It's different."
This space, where I now stood, had a stark dissonance compared to the one I had seen within the community.
In Ghostbusters, my room was meticulously organized.  
"What the…?!"
This, however, was more than just a mess.  It was a disaster zone.
The books next to my computer desk were scattered across the floor, the monitor was gone, stolen by someone.  The closet and drawers were left open, revealing a mountain of discarded clothes.
"No wonder it felt so empty."
I finally realized that I was naked and quickly threw on some of the clothes that lay scattered around the room.  Then...
*Thump.*
I stepped onto the cold, tiled floor with bare feet, opening the bedroom door and stepping out into the living room.
The living room was a scene of even greater devastation. It was as if a search warrant had just been executed.  Every drawer was open, and various odds and ends were scattered across the floor.
"Haah…"
My throat suddenly felt parched, so I opened the refrigerator, hoping to find at least some cold water.
But…
"Ugh…!"
A wave of putrid stench hit me, a smell of decay emanating from the fridge, as if the power had been cut long ago.  
I slammed the door shut, collapsing onto the floor, gasping for breath. 
"Ugh, this is killing me…"
My head was already throbbing, but now, with the stench assaulting my senses, my dizziness worsened. 
Still, I had to do something.
Leaning against the wall, I waited for the dizziness to subside, my mind racing to analyze the current situation. 
It didn't take long to reach a conclusion.
It wasn't that the Ghostbusters server had been reactivated, or that I had returned to Earth. There was a high probability that this was…
"A dream."
I had fallen asleep due to the "Dreamfall Waterfall" field effect and was now trapped in a fantasy.
A modern setting? It wasn't strange.  When I had fallen asleep previously, I had also seen visions of my modern connections.  
Although, the headache was a new phenomenon, one that puzzled me.
Regardless.  The situation was clear, as were the tasks that lay before me. 
I needed to find the source of the problem, whether it was fighting a hidden enemy or completing a mission, to awaken from this dream.  
There was only one thing that bothered me. 
"…Was that a dream too?"
The Earth Witch I had encountered just before losing consciousness.  And the words she had spoken…
The more I thought about it, the more uneasy I felt.
Just as this thought settled in my mind, I heard a sound.
*Beep-beep, beep, beep-beep-beep…*
It was the sound of a door lock being punched in from the front door.
*Thump!*
My heart, though not that of a barbarian warrior, lurched in response to the perceived danger.
*Click.*
As soon as I heard the electronic sound, I jumped up and opened the cabinet below the kitchen sink. 
Of course. 
As mentioned earlier, this was a dream world.  The person trying to open the door could very well be an "enemy" attempting to kill me. 
"A sword… there's no sword…?"
This was an unexpected turn of events. But, how many times had I faced such situations? I instantly reconsidered my options and turned toward the front door. 
I was without a weapon, a shame, but what could I do?  When you don't have teeth, you bite with your gums. And given that my physical abilities had been stripped, the enemy's strength couldn't be very high.
"Considering the setting is modern and all."
*Beep, beep-beep…*
The numbers were being punched in slowly, as if someone was entering a code to someone else's house.  
I didn't wait for the code to be fully entered.  A surprise attack is most effective when the enemy least expects it. 
So…
*BAM!*
Instead of waiting, I slammed the door open and charged forward. 
"Aagh!"
A man of indeterminate origin stumbled into the open door, his nose colliding with it, and let out a shriek.
But his panicked expression was no different from mine. 
"Uh…"
There wasn't just one.
"I didn't expect multiple targets."
My already throbbing head felt even heavier. 
*Whoosh.*
I grabbed the man whose nose had hit the door by the collar, pulling him into the apartment with a swift grab. Then…
*BOOM!*
I slammed the door shut and flipped the manual lock, turning the place into a sealed room.
"What, what is this! You…!"
The man, thrown aside and lying near the shoe rack, stared at me in confusion and shouted. 
Simultaneously, I heard voices from outside.
"What the hell! Team Leader Kang! Team Leader Kang!"
"Who the hell are you! Open the door!"
"What are you doing! The code! Stop staring and enter the code!"
"Yes, sir…!"
I had no time to waste.
*BAM!*
I coiled my fist and punched the fallen man in the face with all my might.  
Although it didn't make the sound of a watermelon bursting like it used to when I was a barbarian, the blow landed perfectly.
"…"Not quite?"
"You crazy bastard!"
The man, despite the direct hit to his face, stood up and grabbed my shoulder, pressing me against the wall. 
"Damn it, this is getting to me…"
He was much bigger than me, even what they call a 'powerlifter type'.  In my former life, I wouldn't have even dared to face such an opponent, I would have been too intimidated. 
"Who are you? Who the hell are you, huh?"
That much was certain. But…
"He's so clumsy."
I didn't feel any tension.  After all, how many times had I faced death? Even if I was now an ordinary human, I would have to die if I couldn't handle this on my own.
Therefore…
"AAAAARGH!!"
I twisted his fingers, the ones holding my shoulder, backwards. He winced in pain as I landed a straight punch to his face.
*Pow!*
The man staggered back, knocked off balance by the blow.  I used the opportunity to dive forward, grabbing him from behind.
*CRUNCH!*
I locked him in a rear naked choke, cutting off the flow of blood to his brain and lungs.  The man began to struggle violently.
*BAM!* *BAM!* *BAM!* *BAM!*
He hit my ribs with his elbows, stomped on my feet, and tried everything to break free. He struggled fiercely but to no avail. 
"Damn, I've been a tank for years."
He wouldn't escape just because he couldn't receive a physical resistance boost. He wouldn't weaken from the pain.
"Ugh, ugh… ple, please…."
Had he finally realized that his resistance was futile?  He stopped struggling and changed tactics, tapping on my arm, begging for his life.
Hearing the commotion, the people outside also started to get impatient. 
*Bang, bang, bang!*
Their knocks grew more forceful.
"Team Leader Kang! Team Leader Kang! Are you alright?!"
"What the hell are you doing! Open the door!"
"What are you waiting for! The code! Stop staring and enter the code!"
*Beep, beep-beep…*
The sound of the electronic door lock beeped again. 
Damn, this was getting more difficult than I expected.
"Ple, please…."
I tightened my grip on his neck, picturing the battle ahead.  There were five of them.
"If I take out this one, there'll be four left…"
It seemed possible, but it would be a tough fight.
"Okay, one down."
As soon as the man's body went limp, I released my grip and stood up. 
"Oh, look at the sweet loot I just scored."
I looted the man's belt and pulled out a baton.  No wonder he kept trying to reach for his belt, this was a hidden treasure!
"This makes things way easier."
I extended the baton to its full length, swinging it through the air a few times, a satisfied smile spreading across my face.
It wasn't as good as the Demon Crusher, or even the iron mace I could buy for 200,000 stones, but it was still a decent weapon.  Frankly, I couldn't even handle a weapon like that with my current strength. 
*Beep-beep, beep, beep…*
The code was being entered much faster now.  If I pressed the forced-lock button, they wouldn't be able to open the door.  
But, instead of locking the door, I approached the front door.
The life of a barbarian had taught me this: there's a golden time for everything.  Running away from a problem only leads to a bigger one later. 
Therefore…
*BAM!*
Once again, I flung the door open, this time…
"Aagh!"
… aiming at the forehead of the man who had been trying to enter the code, his head having smashed against the door.
"Swing!"
I swung the baton downwards.  I couldn't use the Demon Crusher's ability to pierce defenses, but...
*Pow!*
It was a satisfying hit nonetheless.
The man, struck on a vital point, crumpled to the ground.  His comrades charged in. 
"You crazy bastard!"
"Grab him!"
My specialty was using tight spaces to my advantage.  But since I didn't have the physical strength I used to, I took a step backwards to create some distance.  
Then...
"T, Team Leader Kang!"
Having entered the apartment, they were taken aback by the sight of the fallen man.
"They're the loyal type, huh?"
Personally, I liked people like that, but when they were enemies, it was a weakness. 
"Team Leader Kang! Snap out of it! Yeah?!"
"One's looking after him…."
So, I had to deal with two right now.  The problem was, they weren't unarmed anymore. 
*Whoosh!*
If the "Team Leader Kang" I'd just taken out was a regular goblin, these were mutants.
Goblin swordsman…
"No, he's got a baton, so he's a Goblin Officer?"
I was chuckling at this ridiculous thought when…
"You bastard, laughing!"
The Goblin Officer, provoked, swung his baton and charged at me.  
*Whoosh!*
It was a powerful swing, with a good sound of air being cut.  But, it was too straightforward in my eyes.  
*Swoosh.*
So, I simply leaned back slightly, dodging the blow. Then, as a counterattack, I swung the baton, aiming directly at his temple.
*Pow!*
It might seem trivial, but this was the crucial difference between ordinary people and adventurers.  
When you swing or stab a weapon with all your might, untrained people never manage to hit their target.  And…
"They don't deliver the power properly."
Of course, I had already surpassed that level long ago.  
Just like this. 
*Thud.*
He fell, hit right on his temple, and lay motionless. 
But did I make him scared of me?
"…"
One of the remaining men took a step back, staring at me.  
This was perfect for me.  There's no easier opponent to deal with than a scared one.  
*Click, clack.*
So, I charged forward.  When I reached a suitable distance, I swung the baton using the power of my hips.  
But…
*Whoosh!*
Oh, he dodged that?  
"Still, his posture is off."
Based on my extensive combat experience, he couldn't possibly dodge a follow-up attack with that posture.
Meaning, I had essentially won.  
I only had to take out this one, and the rest would be easy.
*Swoosh.*
I grinned, aiming to strike the Goblin Officer 'C' in the head with the baton, when…
*Bang!*
A shot.  But it was a small, weak sound, like a BB gun. 
Then…
*Thwack!*
Something long and sharp, like a dart, pierced my flesh, causing a stinging pain.  
I turned my head, looking at the source of the noise.
"Die, you bastard!"
The man, who had been giving "Team Leader Kang" CPR, stood up, pointing a gun at me.   
Only then did I understand what I'd been hit by.
"No, this is goddamn bull…."
*Zzzzt, zzzzt, zzzzt, zzzzt…*
"…The taser is a, a foul… play…."
