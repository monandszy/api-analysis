## Treasure Hunter (1)
Three days after the community closed. 
I spent my days searching for a ship to sail the sixth floor and a navigator to pilot it. During this time, I received good news from Amelia.
“Schuitz, don't worry about the Guild anymore.”
“Don't worry? What do you mean?”
“I found someone suitable and took care of them.”
“…What?”
When I inquired further, it was typical Amelia style handling. She had discovered a Guild executive who had committed crimes like embezzlement and tax evasion, enough to ruin their life if caught?  Amelia had then successfully pressured this executive into destroying all Guild records related to “Riehen Schuitz” using their evidence as leverage.
“It would have been much safer to modify the records to say what we wanted, but apparently that was too difficult.”
“Is there a chance the destroyed data will cause problems?”
“Not generally. Administrative data being lost or damaged is more common than you think.”
Well, that’s that then…
As I silently nodded, Amelia continued, explaining that she hadn't destroyed all the data. She left the information that Riehen Schuitz was a fifth-rank explorer. In other words, my rank of fifth-rank explorer would be maintained.
“You look unconvinced.”
“Even if data loss is common, my information suddenly disappearing seems suspicious.”
“Still, wouldn’t that be much better than leaving the old data untouched?”
Well, that's definitely true.
While I can't erase suspicion completely, I can at least keep the evidence from those pursuing me.
“Good job… No, thank you, Amelia.”
“…It's natural for someone good at something to do what they do best.”
“Because you're more efficient, right?”
Amelia nodded before changing the subject.
“So, how are you doing with your task? Have you read all the materials I gave you?”
Ah, the ship list. 
It was a document neatly summarizing the specifications and prices of the ships available in the market.
“If there's nothing you like, please tell me as soon as possible. I'll have to go look again.”
“No, no need. There was a perfect fit for me, as long as the actual ship matches the description in the documents.”
Once I told her the ship I had chosen, she asked why and I eagerly explained.
“The price is the highest among the candidates, but considering its performance and price, it’s actually a bargain.”
“Hmm.”
“Plus, if you avoid special areas, it can sail to the seventh floor in its current state. And you can even sail to special areas later with just a few additional options. So there’s no need to buy another new ship.”
“Really?”
Amelia replied without a trace of emotion.
I wondered why she asked if she was going to react so blandly, but…
“Well, you know best. It’s something you're good at.”
Amelia’s words made me stutter.
“Uh… I, I guess?”
“We're already in the same boat, and you're the captain.”
A statement that couldn't help but make anyone feel awkward.
However, apart from that, I also had this thought.
Is she deliberately saying this to boost my confidence?
After all, I've been mostly stuck at home recently, just asking for favors from them.
Maybe it was just her being considerate—
“Well, now that the ship is decided, I’ll go first. If I move quickly, I can schedule an appointment before the Exchange closes.”
I wanted to ask if she really said that for my sake, but Amelia put on her coat and left before I could ask.
Well, it’s not important anyway.
‘Anyway, that takes care of the ship…'
If I had more money, I could have bought a better ship, but I’m not disappointed.
The ship I picked this time was good enough.
‘The problem is the navigator…'
It’s always the people who cause the trouble, not the things.

Knock, knock.
I was lying in bed, reading books borrowed from the library, when I heard a knock.
Hm, is it dinner time already?
“Come in.”
As soon as I gave my permission, the door opened as if waiting.
As expected, it was Erwen.
Amelia must be in the middle of negotiations with the seller of the ship we had chosen.
“What is it?”
I closed the book and asked about her business. Erwen mumbled in a dissatisfied tone.
“There’s a guest.”
“A guest?”
Before I could ask in confusion, a woman appeared in the doorway.
Shiny platinum blonde hair and blue eyes.
“It’s me.”
It was Raven.
Unlike the last time I saw her, she wasn’t wearing her Mage Corps uniform, but rather casual clothes. Her hair was also down instead of tied up.
Wow, the atmosphere changed completely.
“May I come in?”
“Ah, uh… .”
Before I could answer, Raven entered the room and sat down. Erwen followed her and took a chair, sitting far away from us.
“Why did you come in?”
“Is it not allowed?”
No, it’s not that it’s not allowed… I was just asking why.
Well, whatever.
Seeing her sit that far away, it seems she won’t get in the way.
“It’s been a while, Raven.”
“Yes. How have you been?”
“So far, so good. But is it okay to visit like this?”
“I came quietly, avoiding people’s eyes, so don’t worry.”
“Ah, so that's why you have your hair down and changed clothes?”
“………Do I have any other reason?”
Why is she answering so rudely again?
I just asked a question. Is she upset about something?
‘I should be careful talking to her today.’
As I was thinking about that and about to get to the point, Raven spoke up.
“Book.”
“……?”
“You were reading a book, I see. Did you buy it?”
“No, they’re lending books these days.”
“Ah… I heard about that. It’s only possible for people with verified identities to check books out, right?”
“Officially, yes, but in reality, you have to pay a deposit unless you’re a noble or a high-ranking government official.”
“But the Master didn’t have to do that.”
Erwen suddenly joined the conversation, but Raven nodded without showing any reaction.
“Right, with the Master’s status, it wouldn’t be a problem.”
“So, what’s the reason you came all this way, hiding your appearance? Did something happen?”
I hurriedly confirmed the reason before the topic went off track. Raven, as if ending her introduction, went straight to the point.
“Yandel… I’m sorry, I try to be careful, but it just won’t come off my tongue.”
“It’s fine.”
“Anyway, I came to tell you something about Schuitz.”
Yes, she didn’t just come to see me.
The long introduction made me suspect it wasn’t just a casual visit.
“Tell me. What is it?”
Since it didn’t sound like a light topic, I also focused on the conversation with a serious tone.
“The royal family started an unofficial investigation about Schuitz.”
“Unofficial investigation?”
“It’s something they usually do when a new person appears. If they do an official investigation without a reason, it would look like they are controlling and suppressing explorers.”
Hm, is it like a citizen surveillance kind of thing?
It’s a dictatorship anyway. So, they’re being cautious in an odd place.
“Anyway, so?”
“I was also investigated, so I revealed some information as we agreed. I only told them things I couldn’t hide, like the powers you displayed back then.”
“But if it’s an unofficial investigation, it seems they don’t suspect my identity itself.”
“Yeah, if they did, you would have been arrested already. Unofficial investigations can be handled in a moderate way or the opposite.”
Rumors that the royal family is secretly training special forces in the shadows aren't even rumors.
The Rose Knights, whatever they are, are a prime example.
“So, what happened to you? In the eyes of your superiors, you’ve neglected your duty.”
“That’s okay. I used the fact that the Third Corps Commander position was vacant as an excuse and smoothly covered it up. I also told my direct superior, Febrosk, that I reported to him separately.”
“But won’t your lie get caught?”
“It’s not a lie. I really did report to Commander Febrosk right after I returned to the city. Of course, it was partly a fabricated story.”
“I see… .”
Her decisive way of handling things makes me feel secure, but I also feel a sense of guilt.
“I’m sorry, Raven, for dragging you into my business.”
“…Isn’t that over? I’m just paying back the debt I owed you.”
“I’ll repay that debt too.”
“Yes, you have to. Otherwise, I think I’ll be at a loss.”
The atmosphere could have become heavy, but Raven’s playful words made it easier.
It was time to move on to the next topic.
“Raven, have you heard about the national inclusion proposal?”
“National inclusion proposal? What’s that?”
“It's not about assuming that the Evil Spirits are the enemy, but about embracing them. It was proposed once 150 years ago, but it fell apart for various reasons.”
“Ah, I remember learning about it before. But why?”
“That proposal was raised during the royal family’s meeting.”
When I explained why I brought this up, Raven was surprised.
“This is the first time I’ve heard about it. You were basically stuck at home. How did you…? Ah, it was a fortnight ago!”
It’s one of Raven’s strengths that I don’t need to explain it at length.
I didn’t confirm or deny and continued.
“Can you check it out? Who brought up the topic at the meeting, and… .”
“And…?”
“Whether the royal family really has no chance of accepting the proposal.”
Perhaps this is the key.

After Raven left, I had a very busy time.
Actually, it wasn’t me who was busy, but Amelia.
I had bought the ship I had decided on, using almost all of my savings, but I couldn't find a navigator to sail it.
There was a shortage of navigators.
I had thought there would be some good choices available in the market since everyone was heading for the Dark Continent with warships.
“I guess finding someone in a month was too difficult… .”
“Speak properly. You’re having trouble finding someone who meets *your* standards.”
Well, that's true.
To be honest, there weren't no navigators at all.
The problem was that most of them were incompetent. 
To properly reach the target of this expedition, the Undersea Island, sailing skills were essential. 
“Lower your standards or give up. Skilled navigators are quickly snatched up by other teams even if they are available, and they wouldn’t join our team if we’re only looking for short-term contracts like hiring mercenaries.”
“Is that so? Then I'll give up.”
“You’re giving up so easily…?”
“What can I do? The Labyrinth opens in two days. I’ll look again next month.”
“So, are we excluding Undersea Island from this expedition?”
“No, we’ll just try it ourselves. I don’t know if it’ll work, but there’s nothing much to do on the lower floors anyway.”
I couldn’t get enough experience even in the early 6th floor, so it wasn’t a big loss even if I couldn’t reach Undersea Island.
But did she get annoyed at my words?
“…It’s not wrong, but it’s annoying. If you had told me in advance, I wouldn’t have been running around so much.”
“I… I’m sorry about that.”
After offering my sincere apology to Amelia, I called Erwen into the room to discuss the next expedition plan.
However, we didn’t need to spend much time.
I had prepared a Plan B in case we couldn’t find a navigator.
“You mean… enter a Rift?”
“Just for a short time, not for long. It’s not a big deal if we arrive at the sixth floor a few days later. It’s not like we’re joining an expeditionary force. It sounds like you both haven’t gained much Rift experience, right?”
“Of course. Rifts aren’t something you can enter if you want to... .”
That's true.
That's why I didn’t easily share the method of opening a Rift, even in the Team Half-a-Dozen days and the team I later created.
‘It's really convenient not having to hide the fact that I’m an Evil Spirit.’
“Anyway, I think this is good enough for the expedition plan.”
After sharing the plan, we each had some personal time to prepare. Then, two days later—
“You have entered the First Floor Crystal Cave.”
The day of Labyrinth entry arrived.
“Master, why are you smiling?”
“I’m just a little excited. Let’s go to the Second Floor.”
I'm going to feel like I'm exploring again.
