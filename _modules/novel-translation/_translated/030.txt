## Bloodstained Fortress (1)
Any gamer, upon encountering a suspicious wall or an unusual structure, has a habit of pressing the interaction key. I was no different. This habit had helped me discover countless "hidden pieces," or hidden elements, throughout my nine years of playing "Dungeon and Stone."
For example, like this fountain statue here. 
"Bjorn?"
"Right, I'm coming."
I swallowed my unease and followed the group into the keep. I decided to avoid mentioning the statue.
A barbarian knowing knowledge that even a lifelong scholar of magic is unfamiliar with? 
"Best not to stir up any suspicion."
My usual lie of "I read about it in a book" wouldn't work this time. Besides, "that thing" was an item that even distortion magic couldn't extract from this place.
"This is the keep."
While outer walls serve as the first line of defense in medieval times, the keep acts as the last bastion. This was the place where the lord's vassals, knights, and soldiers would be stationed, along with various military facilities such as an armory.
Raven let out a sigh as she looked around.
"...I'd heard it was like this, but still, there's nothing of value here."
The keep, a third the size of the outer wall, was utterly destroyed. All the structures were reduced to ruins, mere remnants of what once stood. Even the monsters were gone.
"Let's move on to the next stage."
Under Raven's direction, we spent about 30 minutes clearing away the rubble and discovered a passage leading underground.
"Mr. Murad, will you lead the way?"
"Of course!"
"Oh, and we need to conserve magic, so please light the torch."
The dwarf pulled out a torch and stuck it on his head. He looked like a mole miner from a comic book, with his short stature.
Whoosh!
We pushed aside the thick wooden planks and slowly descended the stairs hidden below. The dungeon of the Bloodstained Fortress's third chapter.
I swallowed, steeling myself.
“You have entered the first floor of the dungeon.”
Ugh, I'm not good with gore...
***
"Raven, what kinds of monsters appear here?"
"Skull Rats, Banshees, Deathspind, Chimera Wolves, Ghoul Lords, and Corpse Golems, as far as I know."
"Except for the Corpse Golem, I've encountered all those monsters before."
"Of course, you have. The Corpse Golem only appears in the Bloodstained Fortress."
"Ha ha! Looks like we can rack up some achievements!"
The dwarf was delighted at the prospect of gaining experience by battling a new monster.
But I couldn't share his excitement. The illustrations were terrifying, so how much more horrifying would the real thing be?
"Anything else we should be careful of?"
"Just watch out for the flesh explosion. It's not that powerful, but the fluid contains acidic venom. If you get hit too close, it can be fatal. Of course, I'll protect you all before that happens."
"Ha ha! With the mage here, we have nothing to fear!"
"It's thanks to all the brave warriors like Mr. Murad that I can do this."
Bullshit.
A moment ago, they were glaring daggers at each other and bickering over loot.
Thud.
We reached the bottom of the stairs, and a maze-like dungeon stretched before us. Dead Men snarled behind iron bars, chained up, while skeletal rats scampered about, making strange noises.
"Bjorn, are these monsters too?"
"Those are Skull Rats, the ones I mentioned earlier."
"I wasn't asking you, mage!"
They were a basic, non-ranked species like the Dead Men. They were essentially no threat, so we trampled them as we advanced.
Soon, we encountered a Banshee.
"Khhh khhh, hhhh khhh!"
The Banshee floated around, its ghostly form revealing only the outline of a grotesque face.
"Bj, Bjorn..."
Ah, he's scared of Banshees.
Raven chuckled as I felt Ainar clinging to me. It was a good thing he couldn't see that. If he could, he would have been screaming at the top of his lungs again.
"Be careful not to collide with the Banshee. One or two won't be too dangerous, but..."
"...But?"
"You'll have an absolutely terrifying experience."
"Ah, absolutely terrifying experience? What does that mean! Tell me clearly, mage!"
"Well, maybe you should let your imagination run wild?"
Raven smirked as she watched Ainar, who was drained of any color.
That's how she takes revenge, huh? That girl's not very nice, either.
I sighed inwardly and intervened.
"I heard there's a way for mages to deal with Banshees."
"Hmm, you said you like books, so I see you're knowledgeable."
Knowledgeable? Is that all it takes?
Well, if you consider it "by barbarian standards," then maybe.
Still, this level is just scraping by.
"Then let's stop the pleasantries and deal with these Banshees. Teyrun Shell."
A bolt of light shot forth from Raven's staff, piercing a Banshee.
In the game, the magic's name was Magicbolt. A basic attack spell, like a mage's normal attack, that had no casting time.
"Keeeeeiiiik!!!"
We waited a while, and dozens of Banshees began to swarm toward us, radiating intense hatred. They had sensed the "mark" left behind by their fallen comrade.
It would be a welcome sight for a mage, who has powerful area-of-effect spells at their disposal.
"Iherno Hyndar."
Blazing Hell.
Flames erupted from Raven's staff, filling the straight passage.
And when the flames subsided.
There were no Banshees left.
Whoosh!
As always, the magic stones scattered on the floor floated up and automatically entered my pouch.
Actually, I'm more jealous of that than the attack spells. Not having to pick up each magic stone manually.
Hmm, how long would it take to get a mage on my team...
It looks like I have a long way to go.
***
The 2D world beyond the monitor and reality are different.
Especially when that difference sends shivers down your spine.
“The character has entered the second floor of the dungeon.”
The actual dungeon felt more like a mad scientist’s lab. Chimera Wolves with bulging muscles and three or four heads, like mutants. Ghoul Lords escorting thirty Elder Ghouls each.
These 8th-grade monsters all had grotesque appearances, and even the small items scattered around gave off a vibe like those of horror games.
But the best is yet to come.
"Raven, are you not scared at all?"
"Well, I love anatomy, so this is nothing to me."
Shit, she's not talking about barbarian anatomy, is she?
Speaking of which, barbarian hearts are expensive to sell, right? It's because they're used as magical ingredients.
"Ah, we’ve arrived."
Having slain all the dungeon monsters on the second floor, we reached the third floor.  We discovered a hidden doorway leading into a collapsed section of the castle's basement.
Normally, you would have had to get the map from the warden’s room first, but...
“There’s a door hidden behind the wall.  Thank goodness I memorized the map in advance.”
Thanks to Raven’s thorough preparation, we didn't get lost at all.
Well, even if I had been alone, I would have found my way.
The dungeon layout was identical to the game.
‘But, that's because I'm the one playing the game.’
Suddenly, the mage's status felt very real.
Powerful attack magic.
Useful support skills, like the curse that worsens injuries.
And all that knowledge gained from meticulously reading countless books.
It's not for nothing that mages are valued higher than priests in a team.
"Leave your backpacks here in front of the door.  Yandel,  you especially."
Feeling a little bit embarrassed, I dropped my giant-sized backpack, which stretched from my head to my thighs, in front of the door.
…I’ll buy a magic backpack as soon as I have some money.
This thing has been inconvenient since we arrived.
"Oh, and from now on, Yandel, you'll carry the torch, too."
As instructed, I placed the torch on my head.
With all preparations complete.
Creak, creak, creak—
The iron door creaked open, and the smell of decay hit us like a wave.
"This is not what I expected at all."
"Ma, mage… do we really have to go in here?"
"I hate this place too, but we have no choice."
The space felt like a sewage treatment plant. Countless giant pipes lined the cylindrical walls, dripping with thick, dark, gooey sludge.
And.
The ground was piled high with broken limbs and heads.  The air was thick with the stench of rotting flesh, and the stench caused headaches.
"Wack, weeeeek!"
The first to vomit was the carrier.
He stood silently beside Raven, acting as a bodyguard, and vomited everything in his stomach with a completely expressionless face.
The second was Raven.
"Ugh, uweeek!"
Despite her experience with anatomy, she must be vulnerable to smells.
Surprisingly, I could handle it.
Even though a scene that would have made me pass out in the past was unfolding before my eyes, my body, that of a barbarian, remained unaffected.
"You're all right, thank goodness. Let's go ahead."
Overwhelmed by indescribable feelings, I slowly approached the center.
Squelch.
With each step, I felt like I was stepping on a sponge.
And as the light approached the center, the giant figure that had only been visible in silhouette emerged clearly from the darkness.
"Hel, lo."
It spoke to us.
Like a malfunctioning voice recorder, it spoke in a woman's voice.
"Ugh, ugh! Li, live! I, ugh, I need help! Save me! U, uhh, yum, ugh, daddy, eek!"
Ugh, uhm, ugh…
To be honest, it was a bit shocking.
"Whew..."
Shit, you're usually quiet in the game.
Why are you doing this to me?
A complaint escaped my lips, but there was nothing to be done about it.
I glanced at the dwarf, who had seemed reliable, but he was frozen in fear.
"Everyone, snap out of it!!"
I immediately shouted to wake up the absent-minded team members.
As if stimulated by my shout, the pile of corpses stirred.
"Daddy! Daddy! It hurts! It hurts! It hurts! It hurts!"
The pile of corpses stood up and took a step forward with what I assumed were feet.
Woooom-!
The Bloodstained Fortress's mid-boss.
The Corpse Golem.
***
"Dungeon and Stone," a game defined by its minor status, but it does have its share of mainstream appeal.
At least when it comes to its illustrations.
The vibrant illustrations, which look like they were taken with a black-and-white photograph, are frequently used as “짤s" online.
But few people know that the illustrations actually come from the game.
I was reminded of this fact once again.
"Shit."
No matter how realistically drawn the pictures are, they can't compete with the real thing.
"It hurts! It hurts! It hurts!!!!"
What would it feel like if you gathered thousands of human arms, legs, and heads and crammed them together?
Even the individual parts seem to have wills of their own, moving independently.
The same goes for the hundreds of mouths.
They speak without control, each one saying whatever they want.
Most are incoherent ramblings of emotions, like "I'm in pain," "I'm cold," "I hate it," "Kill me," "Save me."
"Kyaaaahhhh—!"
Or maybe they're just screams.
The chilling harmony created by all the grotesque voices made everyone freeze again.
"Hiku로드! Be careful!"
The mage who was said to be good at anatomy.
The 3rd-year dwarf who had encountered countless monsters.
The human man with an air of sophistication, even if he was just a carrier.
They treated the two newbie barbarians like they were nothing…
But surprisingly, I and Ainar were the only ones who remained calm at this moment.
"What are you all doing!"
Ainar, who was keeping a close eye on the Corpse Golem, grabbed the dwarf by the back of the neck and lifted him up.
Kwang!
The pile of corpses exploded like a bola.  Blood and flesh splattered everywhere, sticking to Ainar and the dwarf.
Tsshiiiik!
Fortunately, Ainar was wearing clothes, so he was not hurt.
But the dwarf was different.
"Aaah! My eyes! My eyes...!"
Shit, it looks like it got into his eye through the narrow gap in his helmet.
The dwarf was instantly incapacitated.
And the mage who had told us to trust him…
"Wack, weeeek!"
He was still vomiting.
…What are you guys doing?
No wonder things were going so smoothly.
Of course, that's impossible.
"Ainar! Take the dwarf back and protect the mage!"
With that shout, I raised my shield and faced the Corpse Golem.
There was no choice.
I wanted to run, but…
Those guys were acting like they were driving a bus, and they're doing a terrible job.
"Behel—laaaaah!!"
If I want to survive, I have to take the wheel.
