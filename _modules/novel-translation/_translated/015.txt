## Chapter 15: Return (2)
"Percy? Percy!"
The leader called out someone's name urgently. Of course, there was no reply. My instructions to Erwen had been clear—shoot the crossbowman first, no matter what.
"What the hell did you do?"
The leader finally asked me, but still, he looked warily at the back, not at me. A grave mistake. I loathe it when someone asks a question with the answer already decided. Especially when it's that blatantly obvious.
*Smash!*
Just as the leader's eyes darted towards the bushes, I dashed forward without hesitation, swinging my shield.
*Whoosh!*
Sadly, I felt no impact. To think he'd dodged that. If it had been a goblin, he'd have been sent straight to oblivion.
"Ilis! Now!"
As the leader called out, the samurai charged at me, executing a precise horizontal slash.
*Clack!*
Sparks flew from my shield. What the hell was that impact? I almost dropped my shield. But despite my surprise, I charged towards the three of them. To distract them and give Erwen a better chance.
However...
*Whoosh!*
Another *Smash* missed its mark.  What a pathetic excuse for a Level 2 explorer! 
Fighting them, I realized for the first time how short my shield's reach really was.  But the more I thought about it, the more aggressively I swung my shield, closing the distance.
Then I heard the sound I'd been waiting for. 
*Whiiiiizzzzzz!*
Finally, Erwen's support fire had begun. But the arrows didn't hit the forehead, the neck, the legs, or the arms. The tall bastard with a sword and shield blocked them all.
"I'll take care of the arrows! You focus on the barbarian!"
So that's why he wasn't charging in himself. He'd decided to just focus on the arrows? Humans are far more troublesome than goblins.
*Bang!*
Just as I parried the samurai's blow with my shield, the leader slyly swung his sword, aiming for my left arm.
*Screech!*
Fortunately, I reacted in time. It wasn't deep, but my left arm was already messed up. It wouldn't make much difference even if it was cut, and the paralytic poison was already spreading, so it didn't hurt much.
"Damn, what a monster..."
The leader mumbled, watching me remain unfazed despite the wound.  
*Damn, you're blaming me? You're the one who's lousy!*
Cursing under my breath, I pushed my shield forward, knocking the samurai back with brute force.
Another barrage of arrows came.  
*Whiiiiizzzzzz!*
He must have moved his position, because the arrows were coming from a different direction. But the tall guy was no slouch.
*Thwack!*
He once again blocked the arrow with his shield. Is he a damn outfielder? He's going out of his way to block arrows aimed at someone else.
The situation wasn't looking good, and I started to feel impatient. Then...
*Whoooooooosh!*
The shield, riddled with arrows like a porcupine, burst into flames.
"Shit!"
Unable to bear the heat, the tall guy flung the shield away with his hand. 
*Sorry, our archer is an elemental archer. You should have used a solid steel shield like mine, you scumbag!*
*Whiiiiizzzzzz!*
With the troublesome shield gone, Erwen resumed her arrow barrage without hesitation.
"Aaaaargh!"
The arrow struck the tall guy's shoulder.  He dropped the sword he was holding, transforming into a useless piece of junk.
"Ilis! I'll take care of the fairy!"
The leader, finally understanding the situation, left me to the samurai and rushed into the bushes.
It was already too late.
Damn. Looks like I have to put my faith in Erwen.
"Give up, barbarian."
The samurai stepped back and spoke with a commanding presence.
*Humans are such bastards. What's with the fake-out? He's just buying time until the leader gets here.*
*Thud!*
I charged forward, using *Smash* and causing the samurai's expression to crinkle.
"Why are you so scared when you're alone?"
"I'm not alone!"
I'd asked the samurai, but it was the tall guy who answered, getting up. He held the one-handed sword he'd dropped earlier.
But...
*Whoosh!*
Is it because he's right-handed? He doesn't look very proficient with that sword. He handled the shield beautifully, so what's with this lackluster performance?
*Thwack!*
I easily dodged his attack by taking a step back and stomped down on his knee.
The tall guy cried out in pain, his face contorted with agony.
"Aaaaargh!"
*Whoa, I didn't expect it to break like that.*
The tall guy collapsed to the ground, clutching the broken bone near his knee with both hands.
I was tempted to finish him off while I had the chance, but the samurai ruined it for me.
*Clack!*
That heavy impact. I couldn't get used to it, no matter how many times I blocked it. Why is this guy hanging out with these losers? Is there a story behind it?  I don't know, but it will be his biggest mistake in life. 
*Whoosh!*
I used *Smash*, and the samurai skillfully dodged it, putting some distance between us.  Immediately, I discarded my shield and charged forward again, reaching out my hand.  It's called… *Smash* Pretending to be a *Smash*.  I'm too lazy to think of names anymore.  It's not even fun.
"Gasp!"
The samurai's expression turned to shock when I grabbed his neck.
"This one surprised you, didn't it?"
I pulled him in with overwhelming strength. And then, instead of using my useless left arm, I clamped my teeth around his neck—
*Crack!*
I ripped it off.
"Ah, ah, aaah..."
The samurai couldn't even scream. His eyes glazed over as he desperately grabbed his severed neck, spraying blood like a fountain, and staggered back.
*Thump*
He collapsed to the ground. 
"Sir!"
Did she take care of the other one herself?
Erwen emerged from the bushes as soon as the battle ended, panting heavily.
"Sir…?"
I spat the mouthful of flesh onto the ground and wiped my mouth with my arm.  
*Damn, it's disgusting.* 
***
The grueling battle was over. Or maybe it was just me who felt that way? Erwen was in perfect shape, just like when we first met.  I, on the other hand, was completely destroyed.
"Sir! Here, drink this."
Erwen held out a potion to me as I knelt on the ground, my muscles slackening with relief. 
*Gulp, gulp, gulp.*
I drank the entire potion, cautious like I was taking poison. 
Erwen explained that while it was poison, it wasn't concentrated in one area, so drinking it was the best option. 
Anyway, did drinking the whole potion do something? 
The feeling was completely different than usual.
"Grrrrowwwwl."
Something inside my guts was boiling.  I felt a pain like little chestnuts bouncing around my veins, and my skin itched unbearably. 
The sensation continued for over 10 minutes.
"...Sir, hang in there."
Erwen used the same old cloth to wipe down my sweaty body. 
Was it the poison? Or was it just because I was filthy? 
I don't know, but the white cloth turned completely black.  
*I guess I'll buy her a new one later.*
"I'm, I'm okay now."
Feeling somewhat better, I struggled to stand up. 
I looked down at myself. Large and small wounds, both cuts and stabs, were covered with scabs.  If I drank another potion, they'd disappear, but I decided not to.
"This place will leave some scars..."
*So what if it does? I'm a barbarian.*
"Water."
"Yes, yes! Here you go."
At my single word, Erwen quickly rummaged through her bag and pulled out a canteen.  I felt like a lord. 
*Gulp gulp gulp.*
As I drank the entire canteen, my energy gradually returned. Was water always this good?  The veins that had been bulging all over my body subsided.
"Get my watch for me."
With Erwen's help, I checked the time. 
And froze.
[23 : 20]
Damn, I don't even get a break? 
Only 40 minutes left until the 7th day ends. 
If I don't get back to the 1st floor before then, I'll have to spend another three days in this godforsaken place.
"Erwen, undress them."
"Yes, yes?"
No, you, not them.  
I pointed at the corpses with my hand, and Erwen loosened her hand from her collar.  
"No, leave the clothes. Time is of the essence, so just get their equipment, the pouch of stones, and their bags."
"Yes, yes!"
Erwen moved quickly, knowing that we were short on time.
"Oh, and get that red-haired guy's stuff and the crossbow guy's too!"
*Yeah, and be careful, don't step on any traps.*
While Erwen was away, I stripped the samurai and the tall guy of their gear.  I discarded the chest protector, the samurai's sword, and the charred wooden shield.
After sorting the equipment, I roughly appraised it and looted only the ones that looked expensive.  Then I stuffed everything into my bags, and just as I was about to finish, Erwen arrived.
"Ugh..."
She looks burdened by two bags. But I'm sorry, I have three, so I can't help.
I checked the time again.
[23 : 35]
Only 25 minutes left.
"Let's run."
"Are you sure you'll be okay? You look exhausted."
"Don't worry about it."
Erwen was full of concern, but upon seeing my expression, she nodded and cleared the way. 
Thus began a forced marathon.
"I'll follow as best I can, so you clear the way and go as fast as you can."
"Yes."
I sent Erwen ahead, and continued running, maintaining my pace. 
I felt oddly heavy. Was it because of the mental fatigue? Or was it just the bags? 
*I can't leave them behind. I went through all that hell, so I deserve some reward.  That's how a just world works, right?*
"Hooo, hooo, hooo..."
I don't know how much time passed. 
But a portal appeared in the distance.
Erwen, who arrived first, was waiting for me in front of it.  She had a look of encouragement and sympathy, just like the heroine of a teenage drama.
*Damn, this makes it look like I'm going to be left behind.*
My anxiety grew, and I forced myself to run even faster.
And...
"I'm going first!"
"Wait, I, I'll come too!"
Unlike in a comic, I skipped the dramatic embrace and entered the portal.
*Flash!*
The light burst out, just like usual.
But for some reason, it felt like the light was embracing me.
***
The feeling upon returning to the first floor was no different than when I entered the second floor. 
Like I'd been launched from inside a belly.
"Aaaargh!"
Unfortunately, the results matched the previous experience. 
Or maybe they were worse?
*Thump!*
I was thrown like I'd been grabbed by the hair and tossed away, while Erwen landed safely again.
*How is that even possible?*
When I was tossed onto the second floor, at least I flew up into the air and made a parabola. This time, it was like a fastball in baseball.  Damn, my bones ache.
"This is kind of funny, isn't it?"
"Yeah, I bet. If I were next to someone like you, I'd probably find it funny too."
"Hooo..."
Stretching my stiff muscles, I stood up and brushed off the dust.
And checked the time. 
[23 : 58]
I barely made it.
I don't want to say it was luck.  Then there would be too much to blame on the heavens.  If it's good, it's because of me. If it's bad, it's because I messed up.  That's how living a good life is. 
"Thank you for your hard work, sir."
"Yeah, you worked hard too."
We exchanged farewells, briefly looking at each other.
Wait a minute, I feel like I forgot something. 
"Loot distribution!"
"Oh, right! The essence!"
Erwen and I exclaimed in unison, as if we'd had the same thought. 
"Essence?"
"Yes! You said you wanted me to promise something!"
Ah, right, I did.
I finally remembered what I'd forgotten.
But we didn't have time to chat. 
I quickly checked the time again.
[23 : 59]
About 15 seconds left.
I quickly closed the watch and looked up at Erwen.  
What was her name?
Black something, I think.
"Black Whale! Meet me at the Black Whale Inn!"
"Yes!"
Erwen nodded at my desperate plea.  
I can rest easy now.
*The dungeon has been closed.*
*The character will be moved to Rafdonia.*
Damn, I didn't say how much time was left.
