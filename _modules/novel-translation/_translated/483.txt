##  The Pilgrim (1)
When encountering an unexpected situation, the first thing to do is to "wait." Instead of panicking and moving immediately, calmly assess the situation. This choice alone can prevent the worst from happening. Of course, in retrospect, there may be better options depending on the situation, but at least, it prevents irreversible mistakes.
Yes, so…
“Whew….”
I closed my eyes and let out a long breath. 
When I felt a semblance of composure returning, I slowly opened my eyes again and gathered visual information.
“….”
The location was the entrance of a cave. At the mouth of the cave, where light seeped in, countless soldiers were trapped behind a translucent barrier, yelling incomprehensibly.
“——— ——, ————!!”
Like a muted TV, no sound reached me, but their expressions were frantic… and angry.
The real problem was elsewhere.
'Damn it.'
My comrades were nowhere to be seen.
Or was it just my comrades?
'What is this?'
My equipment had disappeared as well.
The Demon Crusher, the expensive shield I bought, the Guardian Brigade Emblem, including various other number items.
Everything I was wearing had vanished.
In its place was a ragged and worn cloth garment, barely better than a sack.
In my hand, I was gripping a weapon shaped like an awl, crafted from a monster’s bone.
Only then did I realize.
Ah, the real problem was truly separate.
'…Is this a joke, really?'
My body felt heavy.
“——, — ———— —!”
Although the high-weight equipment I’d been wearing had vanished, my body felt unbearably heavy, not lighter. However, instead of questioning this fact, I simply treated it as one piece of information.
[All character stats are fixed at 15.]
Information 1, my stats had plummeted.
To the level of an ordinary person, not an explorer.
The energetic body that could even lift a carriage had disappeared, replaced by a weary frame that found even walking a burden.
And then…
[All character abilities are sealed.]
Information 2, my skills were sealed.
Ogre, Vol-Helchan, Byron, and so on.
All my skills, including the key high-level abilities that had enabled me to dominate with my shield barbarian, were inactive.
'…Even my subspace doesn’t open.'
The same went for the subspace I obtained after defeating the Rose Knights.
“Whew….”
My vision swam, but I forced myself to remain calm. New information was constantly updating.
“Th-this… this is… the Empire’s strict law… you’ll be punished…!”
The translucent barrier that had completely blocked sound was slowly becoming fainter, allowing me to hear the soldiers’ shouts.
‘The Empire…?’
Looking closely, the soldiers’ attire seemed familiar. 
It was similar to the Empire soldiers I saw in the Doppelganger Forest, wasn’t it?
Anyway, putting it all together…
“For the Empire…!”
Information 3, those guys are Empire soldiers.
“Captain, the barrier’s power is weakening!”
Information 4, the barrier at the entrance is weakening.
“Prepare yourselves! It’s time to judge the wicked pilgrims!”
Information 5, I am a pilgrim.
A pilgrim, meaning those who betrayed humanity by fighting alongside the witches during the Witch War.
“….”
As this information gradually stacked up in my head and began to be organized, I could judge what I had to do.
'If I get caught, I die.'
In other words, I have to run.
***
For a 5-player party or less, the Dreadfear, the Terror Monarch, when it reaches phase 4, drags the characters to a new field.
The Abyss of Solitude.
A closed-in field engulfed in darkness on all sides.
The players must fight the Dreadfear, which unleashes new patterns in this location, using skills even more powerful than when faced by a party of dozens.
The Dreadfear’s body, now immense, free from the constraints of the cave.
Token monsters surging from all sides.
High-risk areas of effect, area attacks, and multiple skills that cannot be dodged.
However, I wasn’t overly concerned about the raid itself.
After all, each skill had a clear strategy…
and there was also a means of escape that could only be used right before the dungeon closed. It was as if a minimum safety net had been installed.
But…
‘Is this an emergency… situation?’
Honestly, while playing [Dungeon & Stone], encountering situations like this is a common experience.
This game has countless hidden pieces.
‘Hidden piece.’
Yes, maybe this situation happened because of that.
Information 6, a hidden piece I didn’t know about was activated.
Therefore, I take a few quick steps.
Thump, thump.
With each step, sweat beads turn into droplets, rolling and staining the floor.
Drip-
A delicate body, slightly better than the one I had in the hospital.
“He’s there! Where did he go?!”
Those Empire soldiers are chasing me.
However, I don’t feel despair.
It was a matter of belief.
No matter how unreasonable it may seem, there are no un-clearable hidden pieces in [Dungeon & Stone].
And as evidence,
“He’s moving as if he sees through this dark cave.”
“It must be one of the powers he gained by giving his soul to the wicked witch.”
The cave appears dark to the soldiers. 
The crystals glow brightly, rendering torches unnecessary.
Information 7, pilgrims have certain advantages.
It’s not just the viewing radius, the most important benefit is this.
“Grrr, grrr!”
The monsters inside the cave.
They not only don’t attack me, but they seem to be protecting me from the soldiers.
Screech-!
It was just a way to buy time, of course. 
If not for these guys, I’d have been captured by the soldiers and my neck would have been sliced off already.
“Grrr—!”
…This feels very strange.
I never imagined I’d be saved by goblins.
Thump, thump.
Of course, having the Pathfinding skill also played a large role in my successful escape.
And in that sense,
‘I wonder what happened to the others….’
As I continued to flee, I organized various inferences.
The most likely case was the hypothesis that the other comrades also started individually like me.
After all, this place is similar to the Crystal Cave.
Of course, the Crystal Cave doesn’t have an entrance.
‘…Following that format, there should be cave entrances in each direction.’
The basis for this hypothesis was my starting location.
Beyond the translucent barrier where the soldiers were swarming was a thick thicket.
Like a goblin forest.
“This way!”
Ah, just when I thought I might be able to rest for a moment.
Thump, thump.
I crouched and regulated my breathing for a moment.
I quickly got up and continued down the passage, continuing my thoughts. After all, I can’t keep running away forever.
Survival is a series of decisions.
I’ve successfully escaped so far, I need to quickly finalize the next judgment.
Now, what should I do?
‘Reunite.’
It was the first option that came to mind.
There are quite a few events that cause parties to scatter. Most of those events required reunification before normal clearing could proceed.
Seeing how we’ve been separated, it’s highly likely that this situation will follow the same general pattern.
‘The problem is… that I might be wiped out before we can reunite.’
Erwen should be fine.
She has Pathfinding skills as a default.
The problem is Ainar, who’s directionally challenged, and Bersil Goulhand, who’s a magic-only user.
‘…I’ll worry about that later.’
However, I stopped thinking about that part.
It was a decision based on the judgment that it wasn’t something to think about right now. 
After all, it’s not like I know how I’ll reunite in this vast cave.
I need to focus on the more important questions first.
‘What are the clearing conditions?’
If my current situation is part of Dreadfear’s Phase 4 patterns, then what are the conditions for clearing the stage?
Extermination of all Empire soldiers?
Will something happen if I go to the monument in the center?
Hmm, maybe going outside the cave is the right direction for the next stage.
More than 100 rifts.
Based on the experience of clearing countless bizarre hidden pieces, I pondered, but couldn’t find a definitive answer.
I lacked information.
‘Clue… there must be more clues.’
I quickly made a decision.
I needed to act more proactively from now on.
Therefore…
Thud.
I stopped and hid behind a brightly glowing crystal. 
It didn’t seem like a good place to hide because it was so bright, but I tried to ease my anxieties.
The pursuing soldiers seemed to find it darker the brighter the crystal glowed. 
This place is perfect for a surprise attack.
“….”
How much time had passed since I decided to hide and made that judgment?
Thump, thump.
A soldier, holding a torch, appeared in the passage where I was hiding.
Three in number.
‘Three….’
It wouldn’t be a problem if I was at full health, but with my current body, it was a challenging number to face.
Thump, thump, thump, thump-!
My heart started to race like crazy. 
Should I do it?
Or wait for a better time?
Countless worries bloomed in a fraction of a second.
But the moment of decision was approaching fast.
‘…Three is manageable.’
I quickly made a decision.
I couldn’t be sure how long it would take for fewer soldiers to come out from the main force to search.
Besides, the Empire soldiers weren’t that strong.
Judging by the way they fought goblins, they were probably around level 2 explorers.
In other words, they’re just normal people who die if you stab them with a knife.
Clench.
Hidden in the glow of the crystal, I tightened my grip on the bone knife. 
And…
Thump.
The moment the three soldiers passed the spot I was hiding, I approached them, keeping my movements as quiet as possible, and plunged the tip of the knife into the neck of the soldier in the rear.
Plunge-!
“….Gasp!”
A distinct sound pierced the air.
Before I could even pull out the knife stuck in his neck, the soldiers walking in front of him turned around to check behind them.
“….You!”
Eyes filled with shock.
I pushed the soldier’s body, where the knife was lodged, towards them as I pulled out the blade.
And before the advantage of surprise attack completely disappeared…
Plunge-!
I extended my sword forward again.
“…Ugh!”
I aimed for his neck, but the sword pierced his collarbone.
Because he was wearing a leather armor, the blade didn’t go deep, and the sword was stuck tight.
Therefore…
‘Give up on the sword.’
I let go of the handle, instead, dashed forward to close the distance.
You don’t need a weapon to kill a person.
Swish.
I grabbed the wrist of the soldier who was still in shock from being stabbed, pulled him back, and bound his limbs with a bear hug from behind.
Then, I twisted his neck to expose his bare flesh, and…
Crunch.
I bit down with all my might.
Usually, if you tear the vein here, they die instantly.
“Tr-Troan!”
Okay, that’s two down.
With a one-on-one situation, the pressure lessened.
Well, it’s true that the other guy has much better specs and equipment, but…
Isn’t combat only about specs?
“Come here, you punk.”
The experience of combat is different from a soldier who’s lost his wits after a single surprise attack in a dark cave.
“…Th-this… this bastard!”
The last remaining soldier lunged with his spear, his movements tense, and I dodged sideways.
Next, I grabbed the spear shaft to break his balance.
That was the end of this fight.
Crack, crack, crack-!
I mounted the guy sprawled on the floor, grabbed his head, and smashed it against the ground repeatedly.
Soon, the soldier’s body stopped moving.
“….Spit.”
I spat out the flesh and blood filling my mouth and got up. 
Perhaps because it was such a long time since I had a brawl like this, I felt more mentally exhausted than I had fighting a level 3 monster.
“Whew… whew….”
Perhaps it was due to the excessive adrenaline rush, even though I wasn’t really injured, my vision was blurring. 
However, there was no time to rest.
‘Let’s get looting done quickly.’
After a tough fight, there’s always loot.
***
The Empire soldier’s armor set is fixed.
Wearing a leather armor in the form of a vest, with a piece of cloth with the Empire’s symbol on top of it, and you’re done.
'Even wearing the biggest one, it’s a bit tight.'
But the weapons were good.
You can use it even if it doesn’t fit, and as if respecting one’s own preferences, the weapons are all different, so there are various options.
Mace and shield.
Spear.
Two-handed hammer.
Of course, the weapon I chose was predetermined.
‘Of course, the starting weapon is a mace and shield.’
The two-handed hammer was tempting, but I gave it up.
It’s impossible to wield that hammer with one hand with my current strength.
'Keep the bone knife as well, just in case….'
After choosing the weapon, I rummaged through the soldiers’ remaining belongings and put bread, water, and other necessities in my backpack.
Whew, I guess that’s all the looting done.
I carefully hid the soldiers’ bodies behind the crystal and hurried out of the spot.
Thump, thump.
Even though it’s a bit small, I’ve got shoes, so it’s much easier to walk.
Whew, yeah, that’s the power of civilization.
I’ve switched from using a bone knife to a proper Empire soldier, and my chest feels full of pride.
'Now I’ve got equipment, maybe I’ll capture one of these guys next and extract some information.'
With that thought in mind, I searched for my next target and found it soon enough.
'Four….'
One more than before.
But it wasn’t a big problem.
Whoosh.
I lit the way with the torch, even though it was unnecessary.
Because the Empire soldier’s set has a hidden effect.
“Hey! I got separated from my group, can you help me out?”
The Empire soldier’s set, when worn in full, allows you to avoid being attacked by Empire soldiers—
‘…What?’
Huh? It’s supposed to do that…
“En-engage in defensive posture!”
Contrary to my expectations, the soldiers aimed their weapons at me the moment they saw me in the distance. 
How did they recognize me so quickly? 
I don’t know the reason, but I made a note of it.
“Pilgrim! He’s a pilgrim…!”
Information 8, Empire soldiers can distinguish pilgrims.
And…
Crack-! Crack, crack!
[The character has killed five Empire soldiers.]
[All stats increase by +1.]
Information 9, defeating Empire soldiers makes you stronger.
'Okay, I get the gist of it.'
Now I’m getting the hang of it.
