## Chapter 719: Audience (2)
People in this world often use the phrase "talking to a wall" when they encounter barbarians. They use it because they can't understand the barbarians, even when explained calmly and logically… However, in my opinion, that phrase was more fitting for this knight than any barbarian. It felt like I was truly talking to a wall.
“Knight, what’s your name? I’ve never heard of someone like you before.”
“….”
“Will we truly meet the Great Collapse King if we follow you?”
“….”
“I heard rumors that he was bedridden due to illness. I guess he’s healthy after all.”
“….”
Ugh, what’s with this knight and his haughty silence?  He answered Raven when she asked where he was going. I even asked Raven to try talking to him, wondering if he was a selective mute, but sadly, the result was the same.
“Excuse me… I might be overstepping, but is His Majesty truly in good health…? No, that’s not what I meant… I’m sorry.”
“….”
“See? It’s not working… Don’t make me do this anymore.”
After that, the knight continued walking ahead without uttering a single word, and we silently followed him. Of course, while he remained silent, his mind was busy working.
‘Based on the absence of windows, I'd say this is underground.’
‘Audience Chamber.’ Since it’s the Audience Chamber, the place is likely the ‘Immortal Palace,’ one of the twelve palaces, rumored to be where the king resides.
The heart of the city, Karnon.
The heart of the royal palace, Karnon.
And the Immortal Palace, the very center of the twelve palaces within the royal palace. 
Oh, they call it the Great Collapse Palace now, right? 
‘I didn’t know this place existed underground….’
Even while following the knight, I closely observed my surroundings. I wanted to memorize the route and, just in case, explore escape routes. However, I found nothing of use. There was simply nothing remarkable.
Thud, thud.
We continued walking through the empty corridor. 
During that journey, I did discover a few things. 
‘It's a spiral structure.’
I hadn't realized it at first, but we weren’t walking in a straight line. The corridor subtly curved, ultimately forming a circle. To put it simply, it was like going up a spiral staircase…
“Wouldn't it be better to install an elevator for this distance? I saw that they use good ones earlier.”
“….”
Secondly, this place doesn’t have an elevator. Simply put, to reach the place where we came from, with the elevator, we have no choice but to walk this long corridor. 
Why this inconvenient design?
The royal family isn’t short of money, either. In fact, installing another elevator would have been more cost-effective.
After pondering for a moment, I came up with the answer.
‘…It’s for defense.’
If an outsider were to invade, this long corridor would act as a more reliable means of delaying them than any trap or obstacle. Sometimes, the most primitive methods are the safest.
“….”
After walking through the corridor for over three hours, without any conversation, the long, spiraling passage ended, revealing a large cavern.
“This is….”
Raven tilted her head, her eyes wide with wonder.
The space itself was unremarkable, but a single structure in the center captivated our attention.
A test tube.
It was a transparent test tube, very similar in form to the ones we had seen in the ‘Pantelion Research Institute’ on the first underground level.
There was only one difference between it and those in the institute.
A size that dwarfed even the most formidable layer lords.
Other than that, it was largely similar to what we had seen in the institute. Hundreds of wires connected to the bottom of the test tube, and the inside was filled with a mysterious liquid.
“Follow me.”
The knight, who had been guiding us, finally spoke after a long silence.
“His Majesty awaits.”
Though he spoke these words, the underlying meaning was clear:  Don’t get distracted by useless things. Therefore, the pointless question of ‘what is this’ was skipped. 
Ding-!
As we followed the knight, an elevator appeared on the opposite wall of the cavern. We rode it upwards.
And…….
Ding-!
When the elevator door opened again, I realized we had finally arrived.
“…I, a humble servant, behold the master of the new age.”
In the ‘Audience Chamber,’ the very place I had failed to reach after countless tries. 
***
The throne, placed on a raised platform.
Looking at the throne, an odd feeling washed over me.
“….”
“….”
Though I had participated in countless official events, including investiture ceremonies and ascension ceremonies, I had always seen only an empty throne. Even the prime minister, known as the second in command of the kingdom, never dared to sit upon that throne.
Now, someone was sitting on that throne for the first time.
Was that the reason?
Thump-!
Seeing that sight, the heart of a seasoned warrior, who had experienced countless battles, tightened with tension. 
Well, not as much as Raven, who was beside me.
“H, H, H, H, H….”
“….”
“Your Majesty… I, a humble servant… No, I, I, I, a humble servant, behold your Majesty…!”
As soon as Raven confirmed that ‘someone’ was sitting on the throne, she prostrated herself on the carpeted floor.
Though her belly faced the ground, it was no different from a dog rolling onto its back, exposing its belly.
I have no intention of rebelling and I submit to you.
A gesture that conveyed that short sentence more clearly than anything else.
“Hey, Mr. Yandell…! What are you doing…!”
Raven, with her forehead pressed against the floor, urged me with a small shout, seeing me stand there.
And only then did I realize my ‘impoliteness’.
It’s not like I had ever had to worry about such things due to starting as a barbarian…
Swish.
There’s only one reason why barbarians can talk casually to royalty, regardless of nobility or etiquette, and get away with it.
Their ancestors made great contributions to the king.
The very king sitting on the throne, that is.
“O, Oh, hurry!”
It goes without saying that even barbarians would die for talking back to the king.
Therefore…….
“…I, a humble servant, behold your Majesty.”
Though I had never done it before, I followed the etiquette I had witnessed countless times, kneeling and bowing my head.
After all, I am a titled nobleman.
I didn’t have to prostrate myself like Raven…
Thanks to my elevated vantage point, I could at least glance around the Audience Chamber.
Thick silk curtains hung around the throne, concealing the king's face. The windows were non-existent, perhaps out of concern for assassination or external observation.  There was only one entrance, excluding the elevator we had taken to get here.
And in front of it stood two knights.
Unlike the nameless knight who had guided us here, their armor bore emblems that made it easy to identify their affiliation.
‘The Guardian Knights.’
This elite force, distinguished by their individual combat prowess, surpassing at least 3-grade monsters, was only seen within the Immortal Palace. 
Was it because the filled throne felt so surreal?
It wasn’t until I saw the Guardian Knights that I truly realized.
‘Yes, I’m truly inside the Immortal Palace….’
Once I grasped this, I did one thing immediately.
I downgraded the priority of all escape plans and combat scenarios that involved force.
If this place is truly inside the ‘Immortal Palace,’ using ‘force’ should be our absolute last resort.
You see, I had been inside the Immortal Palace quite a few times while playing ‘Dungeon and Stone’.
And 99% of those experiences were when I was trying to rebel…
‘Still, I never got to see the king’s face….’
Forget the Guardian Knights’ insane stats. The Immortal Palace has all sorts of gimmicks to deal with external enemies. If they activate properly, consider it game over.
This was the Immortal Palace, where even in the game, I couldn’t escape extinction, even with better stats and numerous companions.
In some ways, this place is even more difficult than the 10th layer, especially since I never managed to clear it in the game.
Of course, having the king right in front of me, taking him hostage could open up some opportunities…
But the former deputy leader’s words came to mind.
[Where in this world is there a being who doesn’t fear him? If you ever meet him, you will understand me.]
Holding the king hostage wouldn’t be easy. After all, even the knight who had led us here now stood silently behind the king, like a bodyguard—
“Speak.”
The king’s voice broke the long silence.
It was an unexpected voice.
[…I don’t remember. What age I was, whether I was a woman or a man, even the voice that grated on my ears….]
The former deputy leader must have said that.
“Why have you entered the forbidden place?”
What I heard was a clear ‘young male’ voice.
There was no trace of aging, and no weak or powerless resonance.
“Explain in detail, my servants.”
A voice that commanded obedience, leaving no room for any other thoughts besides submission.
Raven quickly responded.
“We were unaware that it was a forbidden place, and we never intended to enter it. The reason we ended up there is… .”
Raven’s explanation was long and rambling, but one point was clear.
As soon as they realized the Royal Path was under attack, they rushed to the 5th underground level to capture the barbaric Noarks. They escaped, and they were caught in the collapse, leading them to the ‘forbidden place’.
Her explanation included an excessive amount of detail regarding our dedication to our duties as servants.
Well, in my opinion, it was a pointless exercise.
“….”
“….”
An awkward silence descended after Raven finished her explanation.
The Great Collapse King’s voice resumed after a brief pause.
“My servant, Baron Bjorn Yandell.”
…He’s not a baron yet, but I kept quiet.
I’m a barbarian who knows a bit of etiquette—.
“As your king, I command you.”
…Huh?
“Kill the woman beside you.”
…What?
***
The king’s sudden command.
It goes without saying that I had no intention of obeying that order. Even though he has the power to take away everything I have, everything I have achieved in this world, and all the companions I hold dear.
“….”
How could I?
I just looked around, bewildered.
Was that enough for the king?
“Take the woman away.”
The moment those words left his lips, the Guardian Knights by the entrance moved towards us. 
Seeing me instinctively rise, the knight standing before the king issued a short warning.
“Stay still. His Majesty simply desires a private audience with you.”
Glancing at Raven, she nodded frantically.
A desperate plea, conveying the message that she was fine, so I shouldn’t do anything stupid.
“….”
Finally, after I stayed in an awkward position, two knights escorted Raven out of the Audience Chamber, creating the long-awaited private audience between the king and me.
Oh, of course, the bodyguard knight was still here…
He’s like a wall, though.
I could consider it a private audience anyway.
Thump, thump, thump, thump.
The king remained silent, gazing at me from behind the silk curtain, but a sense of dread washed over me.
‘…Ugh, should I just pretend to obey? I’m starting to think that was just a test.’
As these belated regrets filled my mind, the king’s voice resumed.
“Haha, don’t be so afraid.”
His words made my head spin.
“You were chosen by her.  If I kill you, she’ll be furious, so how could I do that?”
His tone was much lighter now.
The wordings ‘her’ and ‘chosen’, so loaded with meaning.
I couldn’t care less.
“Bjorn, son of Yandell.”
The ‘language’ itself was the problem.
“Since we’re here, let’s just talk openly.”
The Great Collapse King was speaking Korean.
