## The Giant Step (4)
When I woke up, it was the middle of the night. Deciding that there was nothing I could do at that hour, I went back to sleep.
I thought I had slept for two days in total, but…
"You've been sleeping for three days?"
At first, I thought Amelia was joking. Even after three straight days of sleep, I still felt tired. To be honest, I had forced myself to wake up, though I could have slept longer.
"But it really has been three days."
"Still, it's good you’re up now. If you hadn't woken up today, I was going to force you. I’m so tired of calming down the fairies."
"So, where's Erwen?"
"She’s out for a bit."
"Out?"
"She said she was going to the sacred grounds. I guess it's not as easy as she thought."
The subject was implied, but there was no need to ask what she meant.
It must be about her leaving the Pureblood Order.
Given how much support the fairies had provided during my absence, she’d have to give up a lot to regain her former freedom.
Like the ‘Shinmok Palace,’ for example.
Or, the money I used to purchase this house, which she essentially held hostage to get it.
"The real problem is the ‘pureblood’ itself, though."
‘Pureblood’ among fairies is a kind of racial secret.
Only one individual per generation can inherit it. The successor’s 'affinity to nature' stat gets a ridiculous boost. It's why Erwen could contract with the Spirit King.
“This problem needs to be solved soon. I can’t just leave Erwen to handle it alone.”
Suddenly, the time I slept feels wasted.
It hasn't even been a month since I barely escaped the Ice Rock and returned, but there’s no time to waste.
But…
Grrr-!
"There are snacks in the kitchen. Go take a look."
Right, let’s eat first.
***
After satiating my three-day-long hunger, my first priority was to organize.
Lee Baekho, the GM, Hyeonbyeol, Ragna Auril Gavisse, and countless other pieces of information I'd gathered from the Round Table…
After getting Amelia’s permission, I shut myself in my room and spent a long time organizing my thoughts.
“Ugh… my head is about to explode.”
It feels like I’m back in high school before the school year starts.
So much homework piled up, no idea where to begin. So, just like I do with games, I organized it by priority.
What do I need to do?
"It’s much better when I organize it like quests.”
After forcibly ranking them like a ‘perfect boyfriend’ competition, my head feels clearer.
So, the quest I need to complete right now, today…
“Amelia, how’s the clan creation going?”
Complete clan creation.
“The paperwork was finished yesterday. All you have to do is visit in person and add your name to the roster.”
I was considering reviving my old clan, but it was disbanded after I was declared dead, and the administrative process was too complicated. I decided to create a new one.
It's a shame.
A clan’s founding date can be advantageous.
“Maybe I can crush it with a noble title later?"
‘Negotiations’ with guilds are one of my strong points.
I was about to change clothes and head out to tackle my schedule when Amelia, wearing a coat, followed me.
“Coming with me?"
“It’s better that way. I’ve handled most of the administrative procedures.”
Well, we can cover more ground if we go together.
Damn, Raven used to do things like this.
"It’ll be a while before I can get her out of the military."
Of course, that doesn't mean I've given up.
Her decision is the most important thing.
"Wait."
"Yes?"
“Wear this. If you walk out without it, there will be trouble."
"Ah…"
I put on the iron helmet Amelia gave me and went outside.
"It's been a while. It's been a long time since we went out together like this during the day."
Hmm, is that right?
Thinking back, it’s been a while since I went to the art museum after buying the 'Vol-Helchan' essence at the auction house.
I haven’t had the chance to walk around freely since I came back to this era.
"Ah, there it is."
The house itself was located in the city center, so it didn’t take long to walk to the guild branch.
We waited like other explorers, drew a number, and presented our IDs when it was our turn.
And…
"B, B, B, B…  Ugh!"
The staff member had a panic attack upon seeing my ID. We were led to the private reception room on the second floor. Then, the guildmaster rushed over to personally handle the rest of the administrative procedures.
Something felt odd.
Guildmaster, Bjorn Jandel.
Deputy Guildmaster, Vacant.
Member, Vacant.
Member, Emily Rains.
Member, Einar Pnellin.
Member, Auyen Rockrobe.
The roster was only filled with the minimum number of people required to establish the clan.
Erwen couldn't join the clan yet because her ‘Pureblood Order’ withdrawal issue wasn’t resolved.
“Pl, please visit us again!”
We left the guild, receiving the guildmaster’s utmost attention. We headed to a nearby restaurant.
After starving for three days, my stomach was already rumbling.
“Amelia.”
“But I'm going by Emily outside.”
Oh, right.
My mind is hazy because I’m hungry.
“What were you going to say?"
"Ah, nothing much, I was just curious. Why did you ask to leave the first member position vacant?"
I was told to leave it vacant, but I haven’t heard the explanation yet.
Why?
“Sometimes, impatience ruins everything.”
“… Huh?"
"Later, when you leave, tell her you intentionally left the spot vacant. It'll calm her down a little."
“Uh…”
What did I just hear?
“...You left it for Erwen?"
I asked, unable to hide my shock. Amelia looked embarrassed and averted her gaze.
And…
“… Because she seemed upset."
She muttered quietly and changed the subject.
"Speaking of which, the clan name."
"Yeah?"
"Is there a reason you chose that name? I checked, and it's a famous ancient language, meaning 'a pack of beasts'."
You thought of the ancient language first too, huh?
So, it’s a success in this regard?
After a moment of contemplation, I told Amelia the truth.
Since no one else should hear, I pulled her close.
"It’s not an ancient language, it’s Korean."
Amelia shuddered at my whisper and quietly asked,
“Korean…? You mean the language of your homeland?"
"Yeah."
I nodded and then told her the meaning.
“It means a spirit of working hard together with one heart and mind for a better future.”
"...Oh?"
"That’s the meaning of ‘Anabada'."
It will also be our clan's motto for the time being.
We’re really short on time.
***
After finishing our meal, Amelia said she had something to do and left.
Where she’s going is obvious.
She’ll go to where her sister works and peek at her from a distance again.
Without even daring to speak to her.
“Well, if she’s happy with that, I have nothing to say.”
Anyway, today's quest is complete, but I didn’t go home.
I had something I needed to do, or rather, wanted to do.
Jingle!
As I opened the door to the shop, a restaurant that was about half-full greeted me.
The second floor is also a guest house, and the shop operates as a pub, selling food during the day and alcohol at night.
"Welcome! Are you dining alone?"
A cheerful-looking woman in her early twenties greeted me with a smile and led me to a table.
“What would you like to eat?”
"Something with a lot of meat. I’ve been walking and my stomach is already rumbling."
“Yes, just a moment—”
"Wait, is the owner not here today?”
"Ah, Madam is taking a break on the advice of the priest. She hasn’t been coming to work lately.”
… Is she sick or something?
I was a little worried, but decided to clear up the misunderstanding first.
"I’m not asking about the female owner, but the male one."
"Ah! If you’re asking about Uri-kpri-te, he’ll be coming to work soon. Maybe in about 30 minutes? It’s always a bit unpredictable, but he’ll be here soon!”
Okay, so I can see him if I wait.
“Thanks for letting me know.”
I tipped her for wasting her time and sat down at the table to kill time. When I had finished my food and ordered a new one, I saw someone arrive.
Jingle!
“You’re here, Uri-kpri-te!”
"Yeah, so anything happen?"
"A friend of yours is here."
“… A friend?”
The bear-like man, who was talking to the waitress, tilted his head and scanned the interior of the shop. His eyes met mine, and he immediately froze like a statue.
But, did he figure out the situation?
"Maira, stop taking any more customers. Send the current ones home once they're finished eating."
“… Yes?”
“And you, go home with the chef once you’ve sent all the customers away."
“Whaaaat?”
“Make sure no one comes near this table.”
The bear-like man quickly gave instructions to the waitress and hurried over to me.
“… It’s really you. Bjorn Jandel."
"It's been a long time. Avman."
The bear-like man, exchanging a silent look with me, took a seat across from me without hesitation.
And…
“…  …”
"…  …"
Silence ensued.
Avman spoke first.
“I… heard the news.”
Ugh, this is awkward.
“I still don't understand what happened, but it seems like something big happened to you."
"Ah, yeah... It did..."
"Did you meet the others…?”
“Except for Misha."
"Right…  I see."
Avman seemed lost in thought for a moment before speaking again.
“Actually, I went to your house a few times after hearing you were alive. There were so many people around, and you didn’t seem like you were going to come out, so I turned around."
“Why didn’t you knock? You could have come in anytime."
“Well, I changed my mind, you see.”
“…?”
Was that a strange nuance in his words?
Probably not.
So, that means…
"Avman, I never intended to deceive you."
Let’s get this straight.
“The reason I couldn’t show my face for two and a half years was because—”
“Stop.”
“…?”
"Bjorn, it seems you’ve misunderstood. I'm not angry with you for that. I’d be lying if I said I didn’t feel betrayed, but… that’s completely irrelevant."
Avman drew a line in the sand and snatched my wine glass, gulping it down before continuing.
“I just don't want to hear it."
"…"
“Whatever the reason you disappeared. Maybe you’re involved in something dangerous. It’s not my business anyway, since we’re not related anymore.”
Ugh, feels like something is tightening around my heart.
"We're not related anymore…"
“I’m sorry, but I think it’s best to clear this up. If you came here to ask me to join your team again, it’s impossible."
This is like being rejected without even confessing, huh?
More than feeling hurt, I’m curious.
"It’s not because of your clan, right?”
“Yeah, it’s not.”
“If it’s okay, can I hear the reason?”
Avman exhaled through his nose, as if trying to suppress a sigh, before opening his mouth.
"The day I heard you were alive, my wife asked me. She looked worried and asked if I was going to see you."
“I see…"
“You know, Bjorn, two and a half years is a really long time. Long enough to break the mind of an explorer who dreamed of seeing the end of the labyrinth."
Avman continued with a hint of sadness.
"So… what I’m trying to say is… I can’t go back to how things were. No matter how much I think about it, I feel like I’ll never be able to see my kid’s wedding if I keep going with you."
“Yeah... I see…”
With that, even the last bit of my lingering attachment vanished.
Or, maybe I never had any to begin with.
Why did I even bother to classify this visit as a quest?
I didn’t even think about trying to recruit him.
No, I thought I had to resist.
I mean, how can I ask him to join a clan that might go to war with the royal family? A married man with kids, no less?
"... I'm sorry."
"Sorry? Just have some drinks."
That’s why I’m here.
“Why? Do you have to be in a labyrinth to drink with me?”
“... Of course not.”
Avman readily picked up his glass, and we spent time exchanging trivial stories.
As customers slowly left, even the staff all left for the night.
The sun set, and night fell.
We laughed and talked about the past, sometimes engaging in serious debates.
“… It’s getting late.”
"It’s just evening."
"My wife will be waiting for me."
“Then… I guess I can’t stop you."
"I’m sorry. If my wife wasn’t so heavily pregnant, I could have stayed longer…"
…  Heavily pregnant?
My mind went blank, but I understood the situation.
“So, you’re having another baby, huh?”
Suddenly, I feel a strange emotion.
Come to think of it, I wasn’t there when she gave birth to their first child. I remember talking about being a godfather or something when we were drinking.
“It’s raining. Here, wear this. I should probably head out and clean up a bit.”
"…Ah, thank you."
We exchanged a few more words before I put on the raincoat he gave me and headed out to the street.
Pitter-patter, pitter-patter-
Heavy rain.
‘It’s not sad or anything.’
Maybe I’ve had too much to drink?
For some reason, I feel resentful about the two and a half years that passed without me.
It feels like I lost something precious.
But what’s the point now?
Slop, slop.
I walk across the rain-soaked streets.
Slop, slop.
Even though I’m focusing on my steps, my drunken body sways back and forth.
Maybe it's because of that swaying?
[Bjorn Jandel.]
The last few words of our conversation keep replaying in my head.
[Take your time. Don’t have any regrets, like a loser like me.]
What’s a loser?
[You can go anywhere.]
Why does everyone keep treating me like something special?
I don’t know, but I walk forward.
Slop, slop—
Reciting all the things I need to do tomorrow.
