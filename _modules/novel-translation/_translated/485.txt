## The Pilgrim (3)
“KWA-JIK! KWA-JIK! KWA-JIK!”
I fought my way through the Imperial soldiers, progressing deeper into the passage. As I neared the central chamber, the number of soldiers increased, but the battle became easier. Thanks to Versil’s healing abilities and my continuously rising stats, I felt like I had reached a level comparable to when I roamed the third floor.
“KWA-JIK!”
Versil and I arrived in the heart of the chamber, where a purplish mist swirled.
“Be careful,” Versil warned, “Anything could come out of this fog.”
“Yes.”
The tension, momentarily loosened by battling the Imperial soldiers, tightened again as we entered the mist.
“THUD. THUD.”
I walked cautiously forward, shielding myself with my shield.  The cavern where we had been battling just moments ago emerged.
I immediately surveyed the terrain.
“….”
An empty cavern.  In place of the monument, stood a 4-meter tall stone statue.
“Jandel-san, that…?”
“It’s probably the witch’s altar,” I replied.
At least, we seemed to have found the right place.
After confirming that we were alone, I approached the statue and examined the altar closely.
“Versil, do you recognize anything?”
// I have no idea if it's he or she by now, I suspect he but..
“No,” she said. “The statue too. The witches I read about in the books were different from this one…,”
“They had to describe them as evil beings in the books.”
“Yes… I suppose so… Then is this really her true form?”
Well, I don’t know for sure, but I think so.  She looks exactly like the girl I briefly met after defeating Riakis.
“This… such a young girl…?”
Versil Goulard uttered, her hand reaching towards the statue as if in a trance.
“Stop.  Don’t touch it.  You might get hurt.”
“Oh, yes!”
Versil startled, quickly retracting her hand.  She then cautiously asked me,
“…What do we do now?”
“We have to investigate further.”
I continued to examine the statue, avoiding direct contact.  There was a three-line inscription on the base, but unfortunately, I couldn’t decipher it.
“I’m not an expert on ancient languages…,” she sighed.
Raven was able to read ancient languages perfectly.  Perhaps player-originated mages can’t compare to the knowledge of pureblood mages?
“It’s a shame. If we knew what it said—,” 
I started to say, but at that moment—
“One star, one sun, one moon.”
A strange voice echoed from behind.
“On this land we look down upon, all are equal.”
A middle-aged man in knight’s armor stood behind us, observing us.
“I shall look down upon you.”
Damn, he looks tough.  Is he the boss?  I hope he doesn’t use aura.
“Isn’t it disgusting? For filthy monsters to be considered equal to us.”
I shielded Versil behind me, raising my shield. The knight sneered.
“Ah, that wouldn’t apply to you, would it? If you had a proper belief in your heart, you wouldn’t betray humanity.”
He finished his sentence, then made a holy sign, unlike anything I had ever seen before.
“I, Argarsil Dreadfear, swear by the sword of the Empire that protects the world to eradicate all filthy pilgrims.”
After completing the holy sign, the knight drew his sword with lightning speed and pointed it at us.
“WHOOOOOOOOOOOOSH!”
Aura swirled around the gleaming white blade.
“…Crazy.”
Is this balanced?
***
When I saw the aura that radiated a brilliant white light.  My vision went black, and my neck froze stiff.
‘It’s impossible to win with a normal fight.’
This much was certain.  Even after raising my stats diligently, I had no chance against a knight who could use aura. Before I could even reach him, my body would be cut in half, shield and all, scattering across the floor.
But…
‘…I need to find a way.’
Instead of despairing about my predicament, I started thinking.  How can I defeat that bastard?
‘There’s got to be a way.’
[Dungeon & Stone] is a harsh game, but not an unfair one. If they’re forcing me to fight a guy like that, with my stats and skills sealed, then there has to be a way to defeat him.
Yes, so…
‘Think.’
I stayed focused and examined every detail.
Argarsil Dreadfear.
This guy is definitely the boss.
So, how do we defeat him?
‘It’s not about leveling up.’
I can’t spend more time hunting Imperial soldiers and level up before entering this boss room.  After I reached 100 kills, I needed to kill ten enemies to gain a stat point, not five.  If it stays that way, I’ll need to hunt for days to reach a level that can even scratch this guy.
‘So it’s… the altar?’
I moved only my eyes and glanced at the witch’s statue.  Maybe, like the soldiers said, activating the altar will trigger an event that will help us with the strategy.
‘The problem is, how do we activate it.’
‘SWISH.’
I unconsciously took a step back and moved closer to the statue.  Then…
‘THUD.’
I reached out and touched the statue with one hand.
“….”
Sadly, nothing happened.  It seems there’s a condition.
‘It’s called an altar, so maybe we need to offer something?’
I had just reached that thought, when—
“Bring the captured pilgrims.”
The knight, still pointing his sword at us, spoke to the empty air.
To my surprise, an answer came from the fog.
“Yes, Captain.”
A sharp, formal response.  Soon, dozens of soldiers emerged from the fog, surrounding two women bound with ropes.
“…Uncle!”
“Bj, Bjorn…  Y, you’re here to save us…!”
So, these two were captured before reaching here by themselves.  I wasn’t sure about Ainar, but I thought Erwen would manage to get here.
While I was relieved that they hadn’t been executed, I tried to interpret the situation as rationally as possible.
‘…It seems like it’s scripted until this point.’
Erwen and Ainar were captured on the way, but they ended up reaching here alive, as prisoners.  Is this a coincidence?  It seems that everyone will end up here, in front of the witch’s altar.
“…UGH!”
“AAARGH!!”
The knight kicked the bound Ainar and Erwen toward us, and Versil quickly untied them.
“I’m sorry…,” Erwen apologized.
“Th, thank you for saving us!” Ainar expressed her gratitude.
Unlike Versil, they both had weapons and armor, presumably taken from the soldiers.  Erwen had a dagger, and Ainar had a greatsword.
‘They didn’t even take their weapons before releasing them….’
“What does he mean?”
The knight grinned at my question.
“I just got curious.”
“Curious about what?”
“About how strong your beliefs are, the beliefs that have betrayed the Empire and the entire world.”
The knight then spoke, his eyes fixed on us.
“Kill each other.  In front of the witch you serve.  Right now.”
I let out a dry chuckle at his words.  Does this bastard think he’s some kind of demon lord?
“I, Dreadfear, promise that whoever kills a filthy pilgrim and proves their purity shall have all their sins forgiven.”
This boss battle concept is pretty intense.
***
Dozens of soldiers surrounded us.  In front of those soldiers stood Dreadfear, his sword drawn, his eyes radiating arrogance.
“….”
“….”
A tense silence descended upon us.
Of course, none of my companions were swayed by that offer.  Except for me, of course.
“How can we trust that?”
“Bj… Bjorn?”
Ainar was shocked by my question, but there was nothing I could do.  My thoughts weren’t sorted out yet.  First, I have to buy time by engaging in a conversation.
“How can we trust it?…”
Dreadfear grinned at my question and replied.
“Trust me.”
It wasn’t a sweet talk, nor did he provide any logical reasons.  But that was enough.
“Captain Dreadfear used [Persuasion].”
“The target’s trust level has significantly increased.”
So, that offer wasn’t a lie.
“Anyone who leaves the witch’s grasp will be allowed to return alive.”
I had no idea there was a way to survive in this manner.  I had a lot to think about.
Of course, I’m not worried about betrayal.  Even if the offer is true, there’s no way my team would betray me.  But…
‘He gave us a way to escape like this.  It means this strategy is going to be incredibly difficult…’
What is it?  A way to escape without sacrificing my team, a way for us all to return alive.
“If you’re having trouble deciding, let me make it easier for you.”
The knight took a step forward.  Then…
“Captain Dreadfear used [Seizure].”
“The character is in an incapacitated state.”
My body froze like stone the moment our eyes met.  No matter how much I strained, I couldn’t move.  Then I realized something.
‘…This isn’t about making us fight.’
I knew he could use aura, but this is just too much.
“THUD. THUD.”
The knight slowly approached us and then plunged his sword into my stomach.
“POOF!”
The wound wasn’t deep.  It would heal completely with a potion, but if left unattended, the bleeding could become a problem.
“UGH!”
The knight stabbed each of us, starting with me, until all four of us were wounded.  He said he’d make it easier for us.  Was this what he meant?
“Your choice now.”
“….”
“Painful death, or life. I’m curious how long your beliefs will last.”
He looked relaxed, as if he was certain that one of us would betray the others.  And I couldn’t blame him.
‘THUD. THUD. THUD. THUD.’
Those on the brink of death always tend to overthink.  I’ve seen it happen countless times.
‘Ainar and Erwen are predictable, but….’
How about Versil, who joined us most recently?  We survived the Ice Rock Expedition together, but is it right to expect that level of loyalty from a player?
‘…Don’t be ridiculous.’
I clenched my teeth, forcing myself to stop doubting.  It’s all part of his plan.  If this was a normal situation, I wouldn’t be thinking like this.
‘…Think instead of doubting.’
I closed my eyes completely, since I couldn’t move anyway.  To beat [Dungeon & Stone], you need to understand the developer’s intentions first.
‘Four of us, united, and then he tempts us to betray each other.’
This seems to be a fixed scenario up to this point.  Seeing that the boss is practically unbeatable, the strategy probably has nothing to do with strength.  These kinds of missions usually have a different outcome based on the player’s ‘choice’.
‘What happens if none of us betray each other?’
Will we just die here and the game will be over?  Or will we persevere until the witch is moved, the altar is activated, and a path opens up?
“….”
Well, I don’t know.  I have no idea what the right answer is.  No wonder 99% of first tries fail.
“Five minutes have passed.”
“….”
“You’ve had plenty of time to think, so I’ll give you each a chance.”
The moment he said that, I regained control of my body.  It started with me.
‘CLINK.’
The knight threw a dagger in front of me.
“Take it.”
“….”
“I’ve even poisoned it with goblin poison, so you’ll go without pain.”
This bastard.
“….”
I knelt down, staring at him without a word.  He grinned and nodded.
“I wish they were all like you.”
My body froze stiff again the moment he said that.
“THUD. THUD.”
The knight walked towards Erwen.  Then…
“Take it.”
He used the same line, and Erwen remained silent.
“….”
A tense silence followed.
‘THUD. THUD. THUD. THUD.’
My heart was racing.  People are really weird.  Even though I believe I trust Erwen 100%, a tiny sliver of doubt keeps creeping up inside me.
“Just one.  Just stab one, and you’ll survive and have your sins cleansed.”
I flinched at his words.  The thought that she might stab Versil suddenly popped into my head.
“…Scram.”
“She has a sharp tongue.”
Thankfully, Erwen’s turn passed without incident.
“Take it.”
Then it was Ainar’s turn.
“Behel… UGH!”
Ainar charged forward the moment her body was freed, only to be tripped and fall to the ground.
Then it was Versil’s turn.
“Your turn.”
Versil immediately crawled towards the fallen dagger and gripped it with both hands.  She trembled, then asked the knight.
“One…?”
“….”
“Only… one?  Is that all it takes…?”
Damn it.
