##  A Fate Reversed (1)
I often find myself lost in daydreams, typically envisioning worst-case scenarios, but that doesn't mean I never indulge in more commonplace fantasies. This instance was no exception.
“……Ugh, uh…….”
This creature, writhing on the ground like someone having a seizure, sparked a sudden curiosity, leading me to conjure such a daydream. What if I were to listen to his tale, be moved by pity, or find some other reason to spare his life?
A flurry of possibilities materialized in my mind. Perhaps I could exploit his abilities, however useful they might be, and use him as a slave. Or maybe he'd experience a complete transformation, gradually earning our trust.
‘…Wait, this is practically a carbon copy of Auyen’s story?’
The image of the former pirate navigator flitted through my mind, but regardless…
I even envisioned a scene where, in a moment of crucial importance, the mercy I extended today would flutter like a butterfly, ultimately saving me. But in the end, it was a pointless fantasy.
[…It’s only natural! Nobody has ever asked my real name before!]
Surprisingly, the creature possessed a cute(?) side.
[Because you tried to rape me in the labyrinth.]
He had a backstory that elicited some sympathy during his fall from grace.
[It’s a world too harsh to live honestly. Oh, of course, it wouldn’t apply to someone as strong as you. Heh.]
Even if the theory that this breakdown was actually a means of protecting his own sanity were true, what difference would it make?
“…Ugh, uh… huh?”
He didn’t, in the end.
He didn't apologize to those who lost loved ones because of his teenage angst.
“Sorry.”
Had he simply done that, I might have reconsidered.
[Well, if there's anything left, it's probably dying gloriously.]
Hearing him spout such nonsense, I was able to clear my head and definitively settle the matter.
“…Don’t bother. Just die like trash. That’s the most heartfelt apology you could offer.”
With those words, I watched him die, his head crushed, his naked body sprawled in a pitiful state.
“Ugh, uh…….”
His rasping groans gradually weakened, and the blood that once erupted with each cough slowly decreased in frequency. It wasn’t because he was recovering. It was the opposite.
“…….”
Eventually, his body stopped trembling, and his gaze drifted towards the empty void. Was he seeing something?
“Uh… huh…….”
His lips, barely moving, uttered something. I strained my ears to catch his words, managing to decipher the general meaning. It was difficult to understand with his slurred speech.
“Uh… Ma…”.
It's oddly fascinating, how they all end up saying the same thing.
“Mom…”.
Of course, that didn't mean I felt any sympathy.
Hans A, who tried to kill me, had a family too.
Ugh.
If I let myself be swayed by such things, I wouldn't survive in this world.
“Huu…….”
I slowly raised my head and looked at the sky.
[Groooooowwwl…….]
Three moons, writhing, pulsating, formed from corpses.
If there's a hell, it must be up there. As I entertained that thought, the ground began to tremble violently.
Drrr, drrr, drrr, drrr, drrr-!
I lowered my head and stared at the horizon, where I saw the green world collapsing from a distance. 
The meaning was simple.
「The character possessing the symbol has died.」
Right, he's dead. I thought it was strange that I couldn’t hear anything anymore.
“…….”
It was the same as when I killed the Dragon Slayer.
I felt strangely numb. 
No surge of emotion, no sense of satisfaction.
Nor did I feel a void.
What kind of feeling is this, then?
Instead of pondering this, I drew a line in my mind.
Avet Necrafetto, the Corpse Collector.
Another name erased from the death list, but the list was still full.
‘A long road ahead.’
Well, I'll just take things one step at a time.
***
「The character is moving to Lapdonia.」
***
When I opened my eyes, returning from the underworld, the first thing I saw was fire.
Whoooosh-!
Left, right, front, back.
Every direction was engulfed in flames, and the smoke that billowed with each breath, hot and acrid, burned my nose and choked my lungs.
「The Fire Jewel has been activated.」
「All fire-based continuous damage within a 15-meter radius has been reduced by 50%.」
Huu, at least this gives me a fighting chance.
‘The enemy…’.
I quickly scanned my surroundings with the Fire Jewel activated, but I sensed no presence or energy.
‘None.’
Well, it’s only natural with everything burning?
It was better than being surrounded by enemies right after stepping out.
The problem was, I had no idea where my comrades were.
‘…What happened?’
I needed to quickly assess the situation. We were fighting the Noark forces when I entered the underworld.
‘I was only in there for a couple of hours…’.
But the city was engulfed in flames upon my return, and I couldn't see anyone.
However, I was certain of one thing. 
This wasn’t the worst possible scenario.
If the Noark had won, they would have been waiting here, forming a siege formation,  with Astarotta and Raven’s heads as trophies.
‘Conversely, that means they’re likely safe.’
Yes, so that means…
Whoooosh-!
Huu, let’s get out of this mess.
The entire city was in flames, and the black smoke hampered my vision, but it wasn’t too hard to find my bearings. I’m not just a Barbarian—I’m an elite Barbarian trained in navigation by Rotmiller.
‘That way.’
Having confirmed the direction, I raced into the inferno, even using [Giant] for extra speed. 
But what was this?
One minute, two minutes, three minutes…
No matter how far I ran, there was no sign of the fire’s edge.
‘…How far has this fire spread?’
I didn’t know, but there was only one thing I could do.
I ran towards the 7th District, my home.
Ten minutes, twenty minutes, thirty minutes…
But as time passed, even my superhuman physique started to reach its limit.
Whoooosh-!
I could handle the heat.
Thanks to the Fire Jewel and my absurdly high physical stats, I only experienced a slight scorching sensation, nothing more.
But it was the smoke that was killing me.
‘Damn it.’
As the saying goes, more people die from smoke inhalation than from fire.
I was on the verge of death, unable to breathe properly.
I’d managed to get this far by holding my breath with my superhuman lung capacity, but…
Whoom, whoom, whoom-!
I was going to die. Running at full speed while holding my breath would kill me.
BEEEEP, BEEEEP, BEEEEP-!
The tinnitus that suddenly erupted in my ears was a sign that I was reaching my limit.
The heavy thudding of my feet, the roar of the flames—nothing could be heard over the deafening tinnitus.
BEEEEP, BEEEEP, BEEEEP, BEEEEP-!
My vision blurred, and every second felt like an eternity. My head spun, as if I had motion sickness.
‘…Damn it, am I going to die like this?’
As the saying goes, a healthy mind resides in a healthy body.
My exhausted body kept conjuring up negative thoughts, urging me to give up and find peace.
But…
‘…Don’t be ridiculous.’
How had I survived all this time?
Being beheaded, devoured by monsters… no, it couldn’t be something as simple as a lack of oxygen.
BEEEEP, BEEEEP, BEEEEP, BEEEEP-!
I wouldn't die that way, not for anything.
Crack-!
I slapped myself in the face to jolt my fading consciousness.
And…
Whoom, whoom, whoom-!
I kept taking steps.
Whoom, whoom, whoom-!
I didn't know how much time had passed. I couldn’t even tell if I was running straight anymore, my perception of time distorted.
Swoosh.
My legs gave way, and my body lurched forward. Then…
Whoom-!
My body, thrown off balance, slammed into something solid, jolting me fully awake.
“The… wall?”
It’s the wall. I don’t know how much time passed before I got here.
“The… wall…”
The moment I realized what I'd bumped into, my body surged with newfound energy.
I didn’t have time to find the gate. A Barbarian’s specialty is not finding paths, but creating them. I grabbed onto cracks in the hot bricks and climbed the wall, like a cockroach.
And when I finally reached the top of the wall…
‘…I made it.’
My body, aware of my survival, went limp.
Even on top of the wall, it was still difficult to breathe.
But a drop of water is like life itself to someone lost in the desert.
“Haa… haa… haa…….”
Despite the smoke making me cough, I took deep breaths. My body began to recover as I continued.
‘…I actually made it. Barely.’
I finally rose from the wall and looked around.
The wall was tall enough to see the entire city from the top on a clear day. Seeing it now, it was clear how much of the city was ablaze.
“This is insane…”
The entire 8th District was burning, billowing smoke, and…
“…The fire has reached the 7th District.”
The 7th District was in a similar state.
Looking down from above, I could see that over a third of the 7th District was consumed by flames.
“Damn it.”
My investments flashed before my eyes, reminding me of the loss, but I quickly pushed the thought away. 
Money can always be made.
In a critical situation, priorities are key.
My top priority right now was to survive this war, not to worry about ‘money’ or ‘consequences’.
‘Huu… What should I do now?’
I had barely escaped a near-death experience, but now real problems were starting to gnaw at my mind.
Astarotta and Raven, both missing.
My clan members, supposedly hiding in the Barbarian sanctuary.
Amelia and Auyen, the last communication received from them being a desperate message saying they were being chased in the 4th District…
‘Raven is a concern, but…’
My primary objective was the sanctuary.
It would be pointless to search through the endless sea of fire. It was more logical to go to the sanctuary, reunite with my clan members, and search together.
‘Astarotta is there too, so I shouldn’t worry too much…’
I couldn’t afford to hesitate.
I quickly started running along the wall, towards the sanctuary. 
It was more efficient and convenient to travel on the wall rather than leap into the burning city. 
Whoom, whoom, whoom-!
I raced along the wall, towards the sanctuary, my mind focused.
“……?”
I stopped abruptly, every muscle tense.
A figure emerged through the obscuring black smoke.
No, to be precise…
“…You’re here.”
He was waiting for me.
‘A black wolf mask…’
The design matched perfectly with the one worn by Baekho's former companion, ‘Briet’.
I instantly recognized him.
Hirkumauta. 
The ‘ancient’ group said to be followers of Diplun Grundel Gavrilius, the Last Great Sage.
The wolf mask, presumed to be one of their members, grinned at me.
“Long time no see, Bjorn Yandel.”
“……?”
“Ah, should I say, ‘Lion King’? Ha ha!”
I sighed quietly.
‘Ha, I already have so much to worry about.’
What is this guy doing here?
