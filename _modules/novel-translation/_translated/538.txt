## Rainbow (5)
Garpus's Necklace.
A Numbers item acquired at my first aristocratic banquet, earned alongside the moniker "Slayer of Knights."  While obtained so early in my adventure, it's an item I've never dared to use until now, several years later.  This necklace requires a solid financial backing to be used effectively.
"But the way the magic stones are accumulating now..."
I felt confident I could reach my target amount within a couple of months.  Besides, when I think about it, there's nothing in the underground first floor that could guarantee a better spec upgrade than this.  In a way, it could even surpass the growth potential of essence.
"So for a while, the magic stones are the most important..."
Images of magic stones, accumulating throughout the entire Chieftain Island, flickered in my mind.  If I could collect them all after the rainy season, I could drastically shorten the time...
But it would be too dangerous, wouldn't it?
"...Wait a minute."
Suddenly, I had a thought.
"White Hearts, come here."
"...You called?"
"It's nothing important, I just have a few questions. You said you arrived at Giant Island during the rainy season, right?"
"Yes, it was the first day the rainy season began."
"I remember that.  Anyways, there were monsters everywhere on Giant Island during that time, too, right?"
"...Yes, but...?"
Hearts, while seeming to be confused by the line of questioning, recounted her experience, describing the scene where "corpse-leaving monsters" and "normal monsters" were fiercely battling each other.
I listened intently, then spoke.
"Isn't it strange?"
"Yes...?"
"If monsters were fighting like that, shouldn't the island be full of magic stones?"
When we arrived at Giant Island, we only saw monster corpses, not a single magic stone.
Hearing this, Hearts finally understood.
"Come to think of it, you're right.  I didn't even think about it at the time...  Just like the island with the village, there should have been magic stones left on this island too."
"When did you first come out of that cave?"
"It was about ten days after the rainy season ended.  At that time, I didn't even know when it would end."
"I see."
My suspicions grew.
Where did all those magic stones go?
No, if this is how the system works, then the bottom of the sea should be full of magic stones too.
*Kwak!*
Even now, monsters continue to fall into the sea, dissolving into light.
Over such a long time, magic stones should have accumulated in the sea, forming mountains.
But...
"There wasn't really anything special at the bottom of the sea back then."
Hmm, should I just go into the sea and check right now?
That thought occurred to me, but before I put it into action, I consulted the wizards for their advice.
"Indeed... I also had a great deal of doubt about that."
"Let's go down to the sea and check immediately!"
"But, there are all sorts of monsters down there..."
"Does that matter right now? We could discover a hidden law of this world!"
"Wait a minute!  There's a way to check without actually going down there!"
"...Huh?"
The wizards, who had been so excited about jumping into the sea right away, were momentarily stunned by Vercile's words.
"Let's use the magic stones we have."
Vercile said, pulling out one of the magic stones she carried and tying it to a rope before lowering it into the sea.  Then she used all kinds of magic to observe the changes in the magic stone.
Thanks to her efforts, we were able to learn a bit of information.
Though I don't know why we didn't find out earlier.
"...It's gone."
"It's just a stone."
The magic stone that went into the sea disappeared.
***
After the experiment, countless hypotheses and questions were presented.
"Could the sea's silvery color also be a result of the magic stones being absorbed?"
"Well, there isn't enough evidence to confirm the connection between the two yet."
"Yes, if magic stones were being absorbed, mana should be detectable in the seawater, but this seawater doesn't have any."
"Hmm...  But if magic stones only dissolve in seawater, what happened to the ones on land?"
Normally, I enjoy these intellectual discussions.
But maybe I've become desensitized from living as a barbarian?
"Um... Lord Baron, what are your thoughts on what we just discussed?"
"Ugh... My head..."
Somehow, the more I listened to the discussion, the worse my headache got.  I made up an excuse about feeling unwell and excused myself from the conversation.
Well, the wizards can figure out the research on their own.
After that, I ran away from the wizards and spent time chatting with my comrades.
How much time had passed?
*Kwak!*
As we entered the seventh day of the rainy season, the number of monsters falling from the sky noticeably decreased.
And...
[23:59]
From past 23:50 onwards, none of them were falling.
"Hmm...  Is my watch about ten minutes off?"
That thought crossed my mind, but we decided to proceed with removing the barrier as planned.  Just in case any monsters happened to fall onto the deck, we didn't want to risk damaging the ship.
It's always better to be safe than sorry.
Tick, tick.
The second hand moved.
As I focused on the movement of the second hand, I felt a quietness spread around me.
I looked around, and noticed it wasn't just me.  Everyone was taking out their own watches and staring at them.
Just like the moment before a new year.
Tick, tick.
Just like no one can stop the passage of time, the moment we were all anxiously awaiting had arrived.
[00:00]
The end of the tiresome rainy season.
"It's twelve o'clock!"
"So it's really over?"
The adventurers, huddled together on the deck, began to murmur, and I quickly issued new orders.
"Remove the barrier!"
As soon as the wizards deactivated the barrier that had been spread over the ship like an umbrella, I felt a sense of openness.
It was like finally having my vision cleared?
It was all because the monsters had been crashing into the barrier and dying, leaving it covered in blood...
"Oh, Daddy!"
As I was about to head towards the bow to enjoy the wind, Erwin, who had climbed to the lookout tower, called out to me in a frantic voice.
"Over there! Look over there!"
What?
I raised my head and stared at the lookout tower, where I saw Erwin pointing towards something.
*Sseuk!*
My gaze naturally followed the direction of her finger, and I froze.
No, it wasn't just me. Everyone who heard her words and looked in that direction froze as well.
Beyond the vast, silvery horizon.
"...Rainbow?"
A rainbow was in the sky.
As if blessing the end of the rainy season.
***
Red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet.
Just looking at it makes me feel good.  A multi-colored band of light.
Seeing it on top of a ship covered in monster blood, the colorful hues felt even more contrasting.
But I couldn't just stand there staring blankly.
We're adventurers.
Whether it's a rainbow, or some hellish scenery that doesn't exist in this world.
If we see something suspicious, we run to check if there's money to be made.
"Auyen! Record the direction of the rainbow properly!"
"Yes?  Ah... Yes!"
First, we checked the location where the rainbow was generated.
After all, the timing was suspicious.
"An unusual phenomenon that can only be observed when the rainy season ends and you're out at sea."
Is this just a natural phenomenon?
Furthermore, the rainbow we were seeing now was different from the usual kind.  While typical rainbows are parabolic, or curved...
*Swaaaaaaaaaaaa!*
This one was shaped like a cylinder, stretching straight upwards.
It was like an effect in a game that tells you something is hidden.
"It's at 21 degrees from our current position.  It's at 34 degrees relative to the rocky island!  The distance is… still unknown!"
Auyen, who had recovered her senses, spoke in a technical jargon that was beyond my comprehension.  But I could understand one thing.
She had properly recorded the direction.
"But the distance is unknown..."
I was a bit worried.
Should I turn the bow right now and head towards the rainbow, or should I continue to our original destination?
I was considering these thoughts, when...
"What? The rainbow is disappearing!"
The rainbow, which had been floating in the distance, gradually faded, until it was no longer visible to the naked eye.
And the whole process took about five minutes.
"It's only observable for five minutes after the rainy season ends..."
I think we might have found something interesting.
Even with that thought in mind, I didn't turn the bow.
"What? Bjorn? You're not going to go find the rainbow?"
Ainar seemed to question my decision, but it was a natural decision for a leader.
We haven't fully explored Giant Island, Tree Island, or the Library Island yet, have we?
Spec upgrade comes first.
I've recorded the direction, so we can start the journey anytime.
"Auyen, what's the remaining distance to Giant Island?"
"We should arrive in about three hours!"
We maintained our course for about three hours.
When we finally arrived at Giant Island, the first thing we did was stare blankly with our mouths wide open.
Huh, I kind of just wanted to come here directly.
"...Magic stones."
Thousands of magic stones were scattered across the entire coastline.
***
The reason we revisited Giant Island is simple.
It's the only place where we found a portal stone among all the other islands.
The last time, I saw that colossal giant, and it's still on my mind, but I decided there must be other secrets to uncover on this island.
But...
*Duk-duk!*
Forget about hidden secrets or anything.  The moment I saw the magic stones spread across the coastline, my heart started pounding.
Of course, compared to Chieftain Island, the density of magic stones scattered here was lower.
However, Giant Island is several times larger than Chieftain Island.
If we could collect all the magic stones scattered throughout this island?
"This is crazy..."
Maybe that alone would be enough to meet our target amount.  So we quickly got off the ship and started collecting the ownerless magic stones, literally scooping them up.
It wasn't as easy as I thought.
It was right after the end of the rainy season, so there were monsters everywhere...
"They're all tough because they've survived the rainy season, aren't they."
At least level 4.
New species with strange essence combinations started appearing too, making the battle difficulty quite high.
But we're also growing stronger.
One example is Muell Armin.
「Muell Armin has cast [Hypersensitive Skin].」
「Target's damage intake increases by 30%.」
「Muell Armin has cast [Eternal Debilitation].」
「Target's constitution decreases by 30%, and all curse effects increase by 1.5 times.」
This guy's class is a curse-specialized necromancer.
His active skills are also curse-related, and his summoned creatures are specialized in that area too.
「Muell Armin has summoned [Spirit Worm].」
It does almost no damage, but when it hits, it has a chance to drain MP.
「Muell Armin has summoned [Corrosive Hound].」
When it bites an enemy, it decreases their resistance.
「Muell Armin has summoned [Ghost Suicide Trooper].」
It flies and explodes, leaving behind curses.
And so on.
The reason I fed it a Manticore essence was for this.
His passive skill [Mother Bird] is for Necromancers.
「Summoned creatures within a radius have been desummoned.」
「80% of the consumed soul power has been recovered.」
「Cooldown time for the corresponding summoning skill is reduced by 80%.」
This is an essence you absolutely need when choosing the Necromancer path.
Just with this one essence, Muell Armin is at least five times stronger than before.
Because a level 2 core essence is that powerful.
「Muell Armin has summoned [Ghost Suicide Trooper].」
「Muell Armin has summoned [Ghost Suicide Trooper].」
「Muell Armin has summoned [Ghost Suicide Trooper].」
「Muell Armin has summoned [Ghost Suicide Troop…….」
He uses the recovered MP and reduced cooldown to summon the suicide troops like crazy.
*Poong!*
He didn't have damage setting, so the actual damage was minimal.  But with every explosion, curses kept stacking on.
"Having a well-developed debuffer makes hunting so much easier."
Muell Armin is a perfect fit for this situation too.
He's more effective against one strong enemy than against multiple weak ones.
"Good work, Muell."
"Work, you say...  Such humble words are not fitting for someone of your stature."
Hmm, lately, he seems to be having a harder time talking to me.
He keeps using the honorific 'Lord Baron'.
"Is he distancing himself because he's already received everything he needed?  Is he afraid I'll make him pay me back?"
If that's the case, I'd be a little hurt, but maybe it's just my imagination.  I decided to keep observing him for a while longer.
And time passed like that.
A day, two days, three days...
[00:00]
On the third day after the rainy season ended, bad news reached us while we were happily collecting magic stones.
"The magic stones... are disappearing."
The ownerless magic stones scattered throughout the island started to decompose one by one.
Like food buried underground, slowly rotting away.
"It's strange...  The mana has definitely decomposed... but we can't find any trace of where it's gone."
It was a truly unfortunate event for us, no matter the reason, but luckily there was some good news too.
"Vercile, how many magic stones have we collected so far?"
"Well, if we convert them at the checkpoint... I think it's around 1 billion stones."
That's more than enough to pull the necklace gacha.
