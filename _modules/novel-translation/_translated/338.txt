## Snowball (2)
Two years and six months.  He had spent approximately half a year there, meaning time had flowed at a rough ratio of five to one. The problem was that this time differential didn't seem to be fixed. 
"Amelia, did you arrive before me?"
He asked, though he was already fairly certain of the answer, and she responded immediately.
"Yes, it was a long wait. The magical device you are holding is something I left behind. It was meant to signal me with a flash of light upon your return. Though… I never imagined it would take more than two years for the signal to come."
He remembered the 'beep' sound when he woke up. 
That was the sound of the magical device activating.
"Anyway, I'll explain everything later. For now, let's go."
Amelia seemed eager to end the conversation and run, but he couldn't simply comply. He still couldn't understand.
"Wait, if the pursuer is Erwen, why do we need to run?"
"You might not know, but that woman will definitely try to kill me. In this city, where the pact is active, I would surely lose a fight against her."
He understood why she'd lose, but...
"Why would she want to kill you?"
"She thinks I'm somehow connected to your death."
"Oh..."
He could picture the situation unfolding in his mind, but Amelia's actions still didn't make sense.
"But if that's the case, I can just meet her and—"
"It won't be that simple to convince her."
"What?"
Amelia stopped in her tracks when he questioned her, unable to comprehend. She looked at him with a serious expression and said, "Yandell, that woman is not the same fairy you knew back then."
Her expression was as if she were remembering some monstrous creature. Amelia was certain that even he couldn't control Erwen.
"But what happened in the meantime…?"
"Many things. I don't have time to explain."
Cutting short his murmur, Amelia continued, "It's debatable if she still intends to do it, but one thing is certain."
"What… what is it?"
"She can't protect you."
This feeling was truly unfamiliar. It was as if his mind was in a whirlwind, unable to organize the conversation.
"Protect? Me? From whom?"
He asked vacantly, and Amelia answered succinctly, "From the entire world."
What does that even mean?
He was about to ask another question when she spoke again.
"Bjorn Yandell."
Amelia called his name and said, "It happened two years ago."
Her voice held the same firmness and melancholy as a doctor delivering a terminal diagnosis. 
"The Royal Family declared you to be a demon."
... What?
