## Chapter 676: Dream (3)
Slowly, I opened my eyes and took in the sounds and visual information around me.
“Right? It feels like it’s right, doesn’t it?”
My wrists were bound with handcuffs, fastened to the handrail. 
Clank!
The location: a large van in motion.
“No, but if it really is him, what on earth happened? A missing person found in their home after a year, and now, they're attacking? I’ve never heard of him being this aggressive.”
Hmm, so this is how it is? This feels like the tutorial part of a game, but the difficulty is too high.
Five burly adult men entered my house using a password, not to mention a taser gun?
‘Right, giving you a taser for long-range enemies without a single weapon? They want me to just get beaten up.’
In my estimation, losing at the starting location and being captured was inevitable. With a high probability, the ordeal would begin from this point onwards.
“Everyone stop! We’ll know if this is Lee Han-soo once we get him to the station and take his fingerprints.”
...Pheeew, at least I’m alive.
“Team Leader Kang? This bastard's smiling.”
“What?! He woke up?”
The man next to me mentioned my awakening, and Team Leader Kang, seated in the passenger seat, jumped in surprise, turning to look behind him.
‘What, they couldn’t even kill this guy?’
Did I break out too early? 
There were only three people in the van, so I assumed the other two were at the hospital receiving treatment.
“Lee Han-soo! Don’t you dare move! Whatever you went through, if you cause any more trouble here, there’s nothing I can do, even if your mother protests! It’s going to be handled by the law.”
Team Leader Kang seemed worried I might cause another ruckus in the van.
Does this guy think I’m an idiot?
“Yes, I’m sorry. I won’t move.”
I made sure the other party was aware that I wouldn't cause any further trouble, speaking in the most polite tone possible. 
However, this situation was absurd, wasn't it?
“What the hell… why is this guy suddenly so quiet?”
Well, I’m under the influence of the taser right now. Unless I have the body of a warrior with superhuman strength capable of instantly breaking handcuffs.
Lee Han-soo, an ordinary man, becomes a cripple just by being cuffed.
Therefore…
‘It could be an escape mission. If there are dreams where you just beat up monsters, then there are also dreams like this.’
I decided to gather information by appeasing them instead of attempting a pointless escape.  It was just a tutorial phase. 
Right, so…
“Officer, I was very flustered earlier. Suddenly, unknown people started typing a password and trying to enter my home, so I was startled. I apologize again for my actions.”
I discard my barbaric mindset and offer a sincere apology to the other party, acting like a well-behaved modern citizen.
But why?
Team Leader Kang’s expression did not soften after receiving my apology. Instead, it grew even more bizarre.
“Cut the crap.”
...Huh, I apologized, and he’s calling me a liar?
I should have truly sent him away back then.
“You were smiling.”
…Huh?
“…I absolutely wasn’t, Officer.”
“Ugh… I’ve truly gotten myself into a mess with a crazy bastard. Hey, what did this guy say to us earlier?”
“He called you a goblin officer.”
Ah, that…
“Haha, I got carried away and spoke nonsense. Calm down, and how about you give me some context? What exactly—.”
Team Leader Kang cut me off, yelling.
“Shut up!!”
What is this sudden outburst?
“Just shut your damn mouth! I’m barely holding myself back right now!”
Ugh, this guy’s spitting.
“…….”
Honestly, I couldn’t understand why he was freaking out so much. But it seemed best not to provoke him further.
From that point onwards, I remained silent and collected my thoughts.
How long had we been driving for?
The van stopped before the nearby police station, and the firmly closed doors creaked open.
The warm sunlight pierced my eyes.
The air of freedom, carrying the sweet scent of flowers.
“Get out.”
Oh, finally, an escape route is open—
“Don’t even think about it. Unless you want to taste electricity again.”
Ugh…
‘Right, well… I need to get these handcuffs off first. I’ll hold back for now, considering getting them off as the starting point.’
I gave up on my escape route completely and followed Team Leader Kang, with both arms bound, into the police station.
We rode the elevator upwards and arrived at the interrogation room.
‘One, two, three, four, five, six… ’
There were a ton of goblin officers, not in the entire building, but just on this floor.
When will this tutorial finally end?
I didn’t know. But, following Team Leader Kang's instructions, I got my fingerprints scanned and was temporarily locked up in a cell. Soon, I was called out again for interrogation.
“We’ve contacted your family, so they’ll be here soon. Oh, and since you were unconscious earlier, I’ll reiterate. Lee Han-soo, you have the right to remain silent. But we hope you don’t.”
Team Leader Kang, who started using honorifics unlike before, began his questioning after finishing his Miranda Rights statement.
“Name: Lee Han-soo. Age: 30. Missing from your home over a year ago. First, tell us. Why were you in that place today?”
“I just woke up there.”
A truthful answer, without any exaggeration.
But did my unconsciously used barbaric speech offend them?
The subordinate next to me flared up, raising his arm.
“…There? You dare talk back to Team Leader Kang? You’re too young!”
“Stop it, Detective Park! He’s a missing person who was found after over a year! We don’t know what he went through, so let’s just hold back for now.”
“But Team Leader! Ji-hoon was hospitalized because of this guy! The emergency room!”
“…That’s enough. If you're going to interfere with the investigation, get out, you bastard!”
Subordinate A turns his back on us, still furious at Team Leader Kang’s order.
“Ugh… I’m sorry for the commotion, Mr. Han-soo. We’ll start the investigation again. We have a lot of questions for you. You can exercise your right to remain silent, but we hope you don’t.”
“Yes, don’t worry. I will cooperate with the investigation.”
“No, don’t take this lightly. A South Korean detective was injured. One of them almost got strangled to death. We have to protect you, or you’re really in trouble. You understand?”
“Yes.”
I answered carelessly, half-listening. Team Leader Kang sighed deeply and resumed the investigation, and I cooperated as well, in my own way.
The problem was that the other party didn’t feel that way.
“So… you were playing a game called ‘Dungeon and Stone’ when you woke up in the game world?”
“Yes.”
“That way of speaking, it’s because you had to survive as a ‘Barbarian’ in that world. You were exploring a place called ‘Dreamfall Waterfall’ and fell asleep, and this is that dream world?”
“Oh, that’s right.”
As I nodded in admiration at his clear summary, I heard a sound of disbelief next to me.
“Wow… this guy’s a real idiot…”
“Is he schizophrenic or something?”
“It seems so.”
It was a bit frustrating to be labeled as mentally ill for telling the truth, but it wasn’t all negative.
If they think I'm weak mentally, they'll be off guard. 
They are all ‘enemies’.
And in that sense…
Click, click.
I picked up the pen on the table and fiddled with it.
‘This end is sharp… ’
Sharp enough to permanently maim and disable someone if it hits a vital spot like the eye.
‘Anyway, I’ve checked how to unlock the handcuffs.’
Thanks to my diligent search during the interrogation, I learned how to unlock the handcuffs.
I learned it by observing the man at the next table getting his handcuffs unlocked…
‘Waist.’
The officers keep their handcuff keys on their belts.
In other words, if I subdue Team Leader Kang, I can unlock the taser by taking the key from his waist.
“Team Leader… maybe we should get this guy’s mental health checked before the investigation?”
“I’ll handle it. Are you free?”
I continued to answer honestly during the investigation, and to my surprise, Team Leader Kang listened intently, or perhaps, with interest.
How long had it been?
“Are you hungry? Let’s eat first. Do you want jjajangmyeon, or jjambbong?”
“Jjajangmyeon. Oh, and also soda, soda too.”
“…Alright.”
I buried my nose in the jjajangmyeon Team Leader Kang ordered and took a bite, when I felt a sense of incongruity for the first time.
“Aaahhhh…”
Could it be this real?
“Why the sudden expression? You were enjoying your meal.”
“Well… it feels strange.”
“What’s strange? It seems perfectly fine.”
“Even in the dream I had before, I had something to eat, but I couldn’t taste it back then.”
Team Leader Kang listened to my response and stared at me silently with an odd look in his eyes. Then he patted his knees and stood up.
“We’ve done enough investigating. After you finish, give me the dishes. I have someone you need to see.”
“Someone to see…?”
“Who else would it be? Mr. Han-soo, you… ah, there she is. Mother, over here!”
Team Leader Kang stood up and waved as he followed him, turning his back.
“Han-soo… ”
The long skirt she always wore.
The old, worn-out sneakers.
The worn-out cap she wore, as if to hide her thin hair.
Beneath it all, the face I always wanted to see but never wanted to see again.
“Aaahhh…!”
My mother collapsed, covering her mouth with her hands.
I let out a dry laugh, looking at her.
“Phoo… ”
It was a real feeling, thanks to this.
“Phoo! Pwahahahah!”
Still, this sucks.
***
It was a single room in a goshiwon, a rooming house, without a name.
My mother always came home late because she was busy working, and I wasn’t old enough to understand her.
She lived with the words ‘because of you’.
She cried, asking why she had a son like me.
But I still loved my mother.
I begged her to stay with me always, and she once gave in to that childish plea.
That day, we stayed together.
She read me my favorite storybook, and when I got hungry, she made ramen. We hugged each other in the cold single room, wrapped in blankets and ate snacks.
I said I wished every day could be like this.
My mother said yes.
The next day, my mother took me to the amusement park.
It was the last day.
My mother suddenly disappeared in front of the carousel, and I was picked up by the amusement park staff only when it was time to close.
I don’t remember what happened after that.
Many adults approached me, and I was constantly moving from one institution to another, changing where I slept every day.
Child abandonment and abuse.
Deprivation of parental rights.
The adults whispered difficult words in places where I wasn’t, and I vaguely sensed it at the time.
I won’t be able to see her again.
‘I understand. It’s understandable to be sick of it.’
Of course, now I understand my mother’s feelings.
A sick child.
A child who causes his parents trouble.
But it doesn’t end there.
A plague-like existence that brings misfortune and accidents wherever it goes.
Lee Han-soo.
That was me.
It was only natural.
Even though she was my mother, she was just a few years older than me.
She needed someone to hate.
The urge to throw it all away and run away must have tempted her every moment.
Well, what happened next was a whole different story, though.
[Kyaaaaak! Don’t come! Never again! Please, just disappear from my life!]
When I found my mother after I became an adult.
She screamed and shouted those words, and I never looked for her again.
That’s why I found it so strange when I heard about my mother from Hyun-byeol.
[We talked about the inheritance for a long time, and… she asked the police if there was a way to file a death report before the missing person period expired.]
I guess she knew my whereabouts and was greedy for money?
Or maybe she just wanted me to disappear as soon as possible?
Only she knows her exact thoughts, but one thing is certain.
“Aaahhh… Han-soo… I’m sorry, I’m sorry… I’m so sorry… ”
She's not the kind of woman who cries like this now.
Well, thanks to that, I was even more convinced that this was a dream world.
“I really… I really wanted to tell you. I know I don’t deserve it, but… can you forgive me…? This useless mother…?”
Looking at my sobbing mother, I made my decision.
‘This… I might be able to use this.’
Not bad, actually.
Therefore, I approached my crying mother and extended my hand. Suppressing all the emotions rising from within.
“I… I forgive you… ”
“Are… are you serious…?”
“Yes… that’s what my mom taught me… ”
As if I were a priest forgiving all sins, I extended my hand and gently placed it over my mother’s hand.
Lee Han-soo’s hand, far from thick.
Pock.
I stroked my mother’s hand gently, as if caressing it, and slowly turned to look at Team Leader Kang.
“Officer… can you please take these handcuffs off for a bit?”
“…No.”
“Ugh.”
This isn’t working.
