## Chapter 541: Verdant Colossus (3)
The Rift Guardian spat out Guardian Essence. It also dropped Rift Stones and numbered items. On top of that, killing the Guardian granted experience, making it more valuable than any other monster. The problem, however, was the difficulty of defeating it. 
“The difficulty of Rift Guardians often depends on the ‘field’ environment.”
The Ice Cave, a level 1 rift, was a prime example. It forced combatants to fight with the debuff [Hypothermia], and this was also true for the level 3 rift, the White Temple. The combat difficulty was significantly increased due to debuffs or other effects encountered during the process. However, this wasn't the city of Kalheim. 
“Millaiel in a place with no celestial magic arrays or guardian angels?” 
I felt a pang of regret, even as I escaped back then. The circumstances were ideal, more so than any other time.  To think she followed me all this way.
“Behel—laaaaaaaa!”
I charged forward, using my shield like a battering ram, a gesture of welcome. 
Kwaang-!
The beast tried to parry me with its spear, but its attempt was futile. It was flung back, tumbling in the air before landing on the water's edge.
Okay, this seemed like a good formation for combat. 
Swoosh.
I lowered my shield, not bothering to go further and swing my hammer.  Combining [Swing] with the Demon Crusher would inflict substantial damage, but…
A dedicated DPS class wasn't just a title.
"Mühl Armin has cast [Irritable Skin]."
"Mühl Armin has cast [Eternal Debilitation]."
"Mühl Armin has cast [Wraith Self-Detonation]…"
Starting with Mühl Armin's curse skills, the ranged DPS rained down a barrage.
"Jackson Janville has cast [Moving Target]."
"Charlotte Amblot has cast level 4 attack magic [Spiral Auger]."
"Noah Merbochi has cast [Precise Shot]."
"Garton Culter has cast [Ballista]…"
Mages, clerics, psionics, archers. A diverse range of classes, each unleashing unique projectiles. 
As tough as the creature was, it stubbornly continued to swing and thrust its spear even while taking a beating. I kept pushing it back, creating space for the ranged DPS to attack. 
About a minute later.
“Celestial Spearkeeper, Millaiel has cast [Light's Blessing].”
A burst of light erupted from the beast's body, a sign that the first phase was over. All it did was spam [Regression].
“It’s much easier without the guardian angel.” 
Of course, there were a few more things to worry about starting from phase two.  Besides [Light's Blessing], which restored a significant portion of its health and significantly increased its endurance and physical stats until the cooldown ended, it started using this combo from phase two:
"Celestial Spearkeeper, Millaiel has cast [Regression]."
Here it comes, that OP skill.
"Celestial Spearkeeper, Millaiel has cast [Comet Split].”
“All projectiles are duplicated."
A single spear shot into the sky split into dozens, raining down like a storm.  It was a phenomenal throwing skill, essentially a single target skill transformed into an AoE with a damage increase and unavoidable judgment. But when it was aggro’d, the skill unfolded in a rather unique way. Like this. 
Whiiuuung-!
Dozens of spears, like guided missiles, converged on me.  But I wasn’t the least bit worried. 
Chaeng, chaeng, chaeng, chaeng-!
The spears, like bullets, bounced off my shield, which covered my head.
"Defense successful."
"The aegis barrier absorbed all damage."
This was why ‘Unification’ and [Enlargement] were so important.  Firstly, the shield's size increased, so did the ‘Guard’ range.  The only weakness of this shield was that it couldn't block projectiles larger than the shield or AoE attacks.
"Well, I managed to block that first attack. Now…"
The pattern repeated itself. The beast picked up a spear embedded in the ground and charged at me. I pushed it back. Once it was out of range…
Kwa kwa kwa kwaang-!
The ranged DPS launched a concentrated barrage.  Normally, this kind of focused attack would be impossible due to the various monsters and guardian angels, but...
As I said, this was a regular field.
Shwaaaaaaa-!
As we were united in our attack, the dozens of spears scattered across the beach disappeared. That’s why [Comet Split] was such a tricky skill. 
“The ‘duplicate’ judgment could be used in countless ways.”
Roughly like this:
"Celestial Spearkeeper Millaiel has reclaimed the Verdant Colossus."
"The power of [Regression] will slightly increase until the battle ends."
"Celestial Spearkeeper Millaiel has reclaimed the Verdant Colossus."
"The power of [Regression] will slightly increas—."
“…"
"…"
Dozens of stacks, built in an instant with a single skill.  The beast hurled another spear into the sky.  A skill combination that was at least twice as strong as before.  However, I felt no thrill.  
Stronger, so what?
"Defense successful."
"The aegis barrier absorbed all damage."
Against the ultimate shield, skills like that held no meaning, no matter how powerful they became.
“It’s definitely true that I’m geared pretty well.”
I endured the pattern where it had to be spread out after reducing its threat level. Essentially, I was suppressing its main skill combo in phase two.
"Celestial Spearkeeper, Millaiel has cast [Comet Split]."
"All projectiles are duplicated."
As it cast the combo a total of three times, we entered phase three.
“That took us four minutes. If we’re lucky, we can finish this in six.”
***
Millaiel’s phase three pattern was simple.
“Celestial Spearkeeper, Millaiel has cast [Descent].”
The ‘enraged’ phase, as they call it.
Shwaaaaaaa-!
Light wings sprouted from the beast’s back as it hunched down and unleashed a burst of light.  It resembled Ainar’s [Wings of Greed], but there was a crucial difference. 
Huuung-!
The wings were much more magnificent, for one thing.  And this thing could actually fly.
"Woooah! Wings!"
Ainar, looking like she was admiring her idol, looked up, her head tilted. The beast took off, soaring into the sky. 
But was it because the field was an island?
“It has no presence.”
Normally, the walls would crumble here, and an army of light spirits would charge from all directions —
“The light spirits, sensing holy energy, are gathering.”
What the…
Even after the field changed, that stayed the same?  I thought it was just a field effect because normal Titanusses didn't have that effect when they used [Descent].  
“Is there something special about Rift Guardians?”
I didn't know for sure, but I was glad I positioned the melee DPS behind.  It wasn't really that I anticipated this, it’s just that we needed to concentrate our firepower, which is why I pulled them back.
"Everyone, get into formation!"
"Just hold your ground, don't overextend!"
Anyway, Bersil seemed to be managing the rearguard quite well, so I didn’t have to worry. I looked up at the creature, which had risen high into the air.
“[…The time of judgment has arrived.]”
For a creature that had been beaten to that state in four minutes, that was a bit much, but…  What could she do, she was just reciting her lines, it seemed.
“What is going on with these things?”
The fundamental question arose anew.  What was this world?  So many people in the city lived their lives, but why did the monsters in the maze all act like game AIs?  
“Oh, this is annoying.”
While I was contemplating, Millaiel, who had soared into the sky, hurled its spear down. I had enough daydreaming for now. 
“Erwin, how long do we have?”
It was time to finish this, so I called out to Erwin. I had saved her for last, and for good reason.
“Erwin, prepare yourself!”
“Yes!”
The moment we entered phase three, I brought out Erwin’s ultimate combo. The creature’s dodge rate skyrocketed once it took to the air, so…
"Erwin Fornach di Tercia has summoned [Dark Spirit King Dichloe]."
The best course of action was to beat it down before it had any room to dodge.
Kwa kwa kwa kwaang-!
The dark orb shot into the sky, bursting into a firework display.  A spectacularly beautiful scene, yet also filled with destruction.  Even while conjuring this spectacle, Erwin kept the bowstring drawn, casting [Focused Shot].
How long had it been?
"Accumulated energy is depleted."
"The empty vessel is imbued with unknown energy."
It was about time for [Chaos Circuit] to activate, when...
"Celestial Spearkeeper Millaiel has cast [Shell Break].”
The creature’s cracked and broken skin shattered, revealing its white flesh beneath.  Well, I guess ‘flesh’ wasn’t the right word.  Its body glowed white, like a fluorescent light.  
Shwaaaa.
The beast slowly descended, wings flapping, its body wrapped in brilliant light, a giant spear held in one hand.  Seeing it from above in that state, I felt as though I were facing something absolute.  
Well, it was about to die anyway.
“[Mortal beings.]”
The beast looked down at me, its tone leisurely, as though it didn’t know it was about to die.
“[Your greed sowed the seeds of destruction.]”
Was there ever a line like that?
“[Your arrogance has ultimately brought about the end of this world.]”
Just ‘I will judge you’—
“[I will judge you.]”
Yes, it only recited that one line before ending.
“Well, it’s not like there’s only one or two differences from the game.”
I didn’t dwell too much on the lines Millaiel recited. I focused on its changes.  To be precise, the crimson giant spear it held. 
"Ultimate Spearkeeper Millaiel has called upon the Verdant Colossus, which has reclaimed its original form."
Just as the creature had shed its shell, the spear also shed its shell, revealing its hidden form.  
The giant spear, formed of intense turquoise light. 
Chi-ji-jit, chi-ji-jit-
The spear’s appearance, shimmering like sparks, exuded an aura of overwhelming power, a weapon that no other could compare to.  
To be precise, that impression wasn’t entirely wrong.
1,200% increase in piercing damage with spears.
Natural regeneration increases proportional to battle duration.
Immune to holy damage and top-tier indestructible.
When using a skill, 50% of the resources consumed are restored over one minute, and when struck by a mental skill, it’s immune and reflects the damage. 
If you activate the active effect, you get three more options. 
All spear damage increased threefold.
All healing effects tripled.
And finally…
“Top-tier piercing bonus.”
A spear that pierces all.  If such a thing existed in this world, the Verdant Colossus would be the first weapon that came to mind.
But here’s the problem:
Tsutsu-jit! Jijik-!
A spear that pierces everything and a shield that blocks everything.  What happens when the two clash?
“[…Disappear!]”
The truth is, I already knew the answer.
"Defense successful."
"The aegis barrier absorbed all damage."
The shield wins.  
With that in mind, I asked Millaiel, whose fatal blow had been nullified:
"Do you know what the most creative weapon in the world is?"
As expected, it didn't respond, but that wasn’t a problem.  So what?  
I continued, nonchalantly. 
“The answer is…”
“[….]”
“A shield.”
Unfortunately, I couldn’t explain the reason.
“Oh, shoot.”
I was just about to finish casting. 
—————————!
A sensation that couldn’t quite be called a sound, a feeling of something passing by, reached my ears. 
Blinnk-!
A blinding white flash enveloped my vision.
“Let’s see, the time is...”
6 minutes 17 seconds.  Damn, I missed the six-minute clear.
***
“Celestial Spearkeeper Millaiel defeated. EXP +8.”
“Upper Rift Guardian defeat bonus. EXP +5.”
***
Shwaaaa-!
The burst of light that signified the monster's defeat.  Dozens of explorers watched, eyes glued to the scene, their throats dry.  They all knew.  
They knew this wasn’t a normal monster, but a Rift Guardian that normally appeared in level 8 rifts.
"I wonder."
What will drop?  
As everyone watched with bated breath, the scene became clear. 
Thud.
Firstly, no Rift Stone, one of the Guardian’s rewards, dropped.  And…
“Ugh…."
There was no rainbow essence either.  The [Comet Split] essence would have been a great boon to Erwin, but I had been hoping for it.  Despite my beginner’s luck, it didn't drop.
It was disappointing, but it wasn't a complete loot drought.  Honestly, it was hard to believe even as I watched.
“…What the, is that?!”
Celestial Spearkeeper Millaiel, dissolving into light, left behind a numbered item.  The key thing was that...
“Rift Guardians have a 33% chance of dropping numbered items."
And considering it dropped a numbered item, a very rare item with a 3% drop rate, it dropped!
"It's the spear the beast was holding!"
No. 7, Millaiel’s Verdant Colossus.  
But upon seeing it, my first reaction wasn’t joy, but a sense of unease.  Or, to be more precise, a sense of dread.
“It’s just that, I got the Aegis Barrier a while ago. And now this? Another single numbered item?"
I had secretly been hoping for this, but seeing it come true, an inexplicable fear welled up within me.  You could call it the intuition of a well-trained unlucky person. 
But humans are made up of the left and right brain.  While my heart raced with dread, my mind immediately started mulling over happy problems. 
“The Verdant Colossus, huh…”
Our party had no classes that used spears, but…  In Dungeon and Stone, the joy was always in making optimal builds as items dropped.
"Hmmm…"
Who should I give this to?  Who would be the best person to give this to?
