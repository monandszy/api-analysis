##  Chapter 378:  Atlantis (1)
The three ships stopped, maintaining a distance of approximately 400 meters. They were clearly wary of Erwen’s arrow attacks.
“Erwen, can you intercept from this distance?”
“Yes, but most of them react at this range.”
Of course, they had a mage on board. They’d have ample time to respond before the arrows hit.
Boom!
A magic cannon on the front of their flagship roared, spewing out a ball of magical energy. 
I’d figured they’d at least offer a surrender ultimatum before opening fire, but I guess they decided it was too late for that.
Or maybe they’d just scoop up any bodies floating in the water after sinking us.
Whizz!
The magic cannonball traced a near-straight trajectory, arcing towards our ship.
“Shwitz!”
Amelia frantically called out my alias, but Erwen responded.
“Sir, I can handle this.”
Before I could ask her how, Erwen loosed an arrow already imbued with the power of the wind spirit.
Kaboom!
The arrow, infused with the wind spirit’s power, collided with the magic cannonball in mid-air, detonating in a fiery explosion.
“Erwen, how many can you block?”
“Four or five at once, I think.”
Wow, really? At this rate, we might not even need a magical cannon defense array!
“Well done, Erwen. Intercept the next one, too, if they fire another.”
“Yes!”
Erwen, thrilled by the recognition of her ability, eagerly waited for the next barrage, but the cannon fire ceased after the first volley.
“They seem pretty surprised.”
I shared Amelia’s sentiment.  They’d surely have a plan, though.
Boom! Boom! Boom!
All three ships opened fire, closing the distance. Erwen skillfully intercepted most of the attacks, but a few slipped past her defense.
Kaboom!
A cannonball exploded near the bottom of our ship, sending tremors throughout the hull.
Alright, time to get serious. This distance is perfect.
“Erwen, activate your Spirit Form.”
Erwen didn’t hesitate, immediately activating the skill. But should I ask?
“What element, Sir?”
“Water.”
Once I declared the element, Erwen cautiously took my hand.  Okay, so the link is established.
“The spirit of water binds to the character’s physical form.”
“The character’s resistance to water damage is reduced by half.”
“Resistance to electric damage is increased fourfold.”
“Power of close combat weapons is reduced by 50%.”
“Bonus:  Spring of Blessings.”
“The effects of healing and regeneration are doubled.”
“Soul power regeneration speed increased…”
“…”
Come to think of it, this is the first time I’ve used Elemental Barbarian (Water) in combat.
Swish.
I lowered my head to observe my transformation.  There wasn’t much noticeable difference.  Just a bit of a dewy sheen, making my skin appear more vibrant.
“Emily, I’ll be back.”
“Where…?”
Where am I going?  The best defense is a good offense.
Hmm, maybe I should tell them?
“Oh, and one last thing. If you think you can’t protect the ship, abandon it and jump overboard.”
“What do you mean—”
There’s no time to explain.
Thud.
I stepped onto the ship’s railing and leaped into the churning sea. It wasn’t a dive.  There’s no need for that, at least not right now.
“Bonus: Spring of Blessings.”
A single-line bonus, without any explanation.
This bonus allows the character to breathe underwater indefinitely and walk on water.
Just like this.
Thud.
My body stands tall on the undulating surface, defying gravity. This is…
“Woohoo!”
… Barbarian Jet Ski (Run) mode!
Thud-thud-thud.
I roar in triumph, charging forward as soon as my feet touch the water.
Boom! Boom! Boom!
The enemy is momentarily stunned by the sight of the Barbarian dashing across the water before they swivel their magic cannons in my direction.
Bang! Boom! Boom-boom-boom!
My shield protects my vitals, but the continuous barrages of magic cannons are far from negligible. 
This is, after all, magic cannon fire.
My physical resistance is useless against magic damage.
Every hit sends a jolt of pain through my bones.
But…
“Erwen, you don’t need to block the cannonballs.”
[What? What do you mean, Sir…?]
Erwen couldn’t finish her sentence.
She saw the Skeleton that materialized behind me with a clanging sound.
“The character has activated [Risk and Reward].”
“The ability inherent to the skill is unlocked by the power of Transcendence.”
“The damage immunity effect of [Chance of Retaliation] is nullified, but its activation chance is fixed at 100%.”
Magic cannonballs use magic as their fuel.
So, in simpler terms…
“30% of the damage taken is reflected back to the enemy.”
“30% of the damage taken is reflected back to the enemy.”
“30% of the damage taken is reflected back to the enemy.”
“…”
It means I can return every blow I receive.
Boom! Boom! Boom-boom-boom!
The moment I’m hit by a magic cannonball, the skeletons appear as afterimages and fire back at the enemy.
However, their return fire never targets the ship.
Swoosh!
A magical barrier surrounds the ship. The barrier easily negates the 30% less powerful magic cannonballs.  
The enemy continues their relentless attack without hesitation.
Suddenly…
“Powerful Luck.”
“300% of the damage taken is reflected back to the enemy.”
Oh, a critical hit too!
[Graaaarrr-!!]
A skeleton appears, igniting the fuse of a massive magic cannon with a unique and powerful sound effect.
Booom!
The magic cannonball, imbued with immense power, explodes with a force several times stronger than before, shattering the barrier that was shielding the ship with ease.
And…
“What kind of monster is that…?!”
“Everyone, abandon the Merina and escape!”
“Get over here!”
One of their ships begins to sink.
‘Shit.’
I never expected them to sink with one shot.  What kind of loss—
Flash!
The ship, now empty of all its crew, is instantly recalled into the extradimensional space.
Hmm, good.  We just need to fix it later.
“Sink the ship first!”
They decide to take care of the most pressing matter first, turning their magic cannons towards Amelia’s ship, which is now all alone.
‘Well, I guess I should have expected that.’
Erwen does her best to block the incoming fire, but she can’t stop our ship from sinking. 
She’s too busy dodging the magic herself.
[Sir, magic!]
“Stay behind me! Just in case.”
I pull Erwen, who is still linked to me, behind me.  The [Spirit Form] makes her immune to physical damage, but magic is a different story.  She’ll suffer far more serious injuries from magic. 
If her [Spirit Form] is deactivated here, she’ll drown for sure…
“30% of the damage taken is reflected back to the enemy.”
“30% of the damage taken is reflected back to the enemy.”
“30% of the damage taken is reflected back to the enemy.”
“…”
I race forward, absorbing every magic cannonball, spell, and ranged skill they throw at me. 
The activated [Risk and Reward] ensures that I return fire every time I’m hit, but the enemy shows no signs of stopping their assault.
“Paltan is dead!”
“We must stop him before he gets to the ship!”
“More! More firepower!”
“He’s dying! Just a little bit more and we’re done!”
They’re pouring everything they have into this attack. 
Of course, they’re probably confident they’ll win. I’m sure they’re hoping to wear me down, hoping to catch me injured and exhausted before I can reach their ship.
What fools…
Fwoom!
A flash of light, fast as lightning, streaks across my body.
“The character has been hit by [Thunderbolt].”
A shock so powerful, it makes me lose consciousness for a moment. I manage to regain my balance, barely avoiding a fall.
But I’m already in terrible shape. 
It’s not just the injuries. It feels like the electricity coursing through my body has cooked my internal organs.
‘Damn, lightning magic.’
Is it because I’m using Elemental Barbarian (Water) and [Risk and Reward] at the same time?  The combined damage, amplified eight times, is enough to bring me to the brink of death.
But… the same goes for them, I think.
[Graaaarrr-!!]
Just in time, another critical hit sound effect erupts.
“Powerful Luck.”
“300% of the damage taken is reflected back to the enemy.”
The skeleton launches a massive thunderbolt, something straight out of a myth.
And…
————!
It blasts towards the enemy flagship at the speed of light, obliterating the second ship that was next to it.
‘That… won’t be repairable.’
As a side note, I didn’t hear any sound.  It’s because my hearing is temporarily disabled.
Beep-beep-beep-beep-beep.
A ringing in my ears, like something is drilling into my brain. 
I lose my footing and sink beneath the waves.
Well, it’s kind of intentional.
“The character’s physical form is imbued with the energy of the sea.”
“Passive skill [Origin] increases the character’s natural regeneration rate significantly.”
I told you.
I can’t lose in the sea.
***
The passive skill [Origin] of Stormgush.
Combined with the doubled healing and regeneration effect from the [Spirit Form], my body begins to regenerate as fast as a potion.
Swoosh!
Broken bones snap back into place, torn flesh and gored wounds heal.
Unlike potions, there’s no pain, allowing me to experience the regeneration process in detail, in real time.
My hearing returns before long.
[Sir, are you alright?]
So, even in a spectral state, I can communicate underwater. But I can’t speak right now.
I point my index finger upwards and shrug, tilting my head with a questioning look.
[Are you asking what’s going on above?]
Right.
I nod, and Erwen quickly provides a briefing. 
[They’ve stopped attacking for now.  They think they killed you.]
Yeah, they’re really sticking with that flag.
[Ah, I can hear them talking faintly… the mage is trying to activate a detection spell right now.]
Hmm, then they’ll know I’m still alive soon enough.  Gotta give them a surprise before that.
I motion to be lifted up, and Erwen summons the water spirit to push me upward.
Swoosh!
I’m back on the surface.
“…There he is!”
The enemy is shocked by the sight of me, a grin like a water demon risen from hell.
“He’s healed his wounds already…!”
“What kind of monster is that…?”
Most are simply stunned, mouths agape, but their leader is different. That’s how leaders are. They must always remain calm and make decisions, no matter the situation.
“Captain!”
“…Turn the ship around!”
The only ship remaining quickly changes course.
That’s why I didn’t heal myself while I was surrounded by water.  If I kept regenerating like a zombie, they would have abandoned their ship and fled.
Even though I can walk on water, I wouldn’t be able to catch a ship like that on foot.
But…
Thud.
I’m close enough to make it, barely.
I take off running, and the enemy shouts in alarm.
“He’s coming!”
“Faster! Go faster!”
They’re no longer even firing warning shots.  It’s too late to stop me from regenerating.  If they get caught in my reflected attack, it’ll be even more trouble turning the ship around.
“We’ve turned it around…!”
“Mana stones! Load them up!”
The ship, finally turned around, begins to move faster as if it’s got a motor.
I’m about 15 meters away.
‘Damn it…’
I use all my strength, focusing solely on running.  These bastards are going to be devastated if I let them get away.
‘They want to destroy our ship and run?  Not a chance.’
They can go if they want.  But the ship is staying.
“Aaaaaarrrrgggh!!”
I roar in desperation, pushing myself harder, and the distance slowly closes.  I’m guessing it took a little longer to pick up speed.
“He’s going to catch us!”
“More! Load in more mana stones!”
The crew on the rear of the ship sees me getting closer and their faces contort in fear. Like they’re being chased by a monster.
Fwoom!
Erwen fires an arrow, sending one of the men near the railing into the sea.  I’m sure she missed his vitals, so he isn’t dead.
“H, Help…!”
The man sputters and screams as he frantically tries to swim. The others don’t even attempt to rescue him. 
I’m too busy running to care.
Thud.
I kick off with all my might, passing the man.
9 meters, 8 meters, 7 meters, 6 meters, 5 meters…
The distance is closing, little by little.
But that’s it.
The ship, finally picking up speed, soon overtakes me.
5 meters, 6 meters, 7 meters, 8 meters…
The gap is widening once more, and the enemy on the rear deck breathes a sigh of relief as they watch me.
‘Damn it.’
The lack of a movement skill is frustrating.  A shield Barbarian usually gets a movement skill at level 8, but I managed to get a Manticore Essence before that.  If I hadn’t unlearned [Leap], I’d have boarded their ship already.
‘Are we really going to end up like this?’
I reluctantly slow down, resigning myself to failure. Not because I think I’ve lost, but because…
“Erwen, fire on our ship.  Don’t worry, it’s okay to destroy it.”
[…Our ship?]
“Don’t worry about the small things.  Do it.”
I repeat myself, and Erwen fires an arrow at the rear of the ship.
Kaboom!
It explodes.
“…The repair bill will be a little hefty.”
It hit right where the flagship’s magic propulsion system was located.
***
With the magic propulsion system destroyed, it was smooth sailing from there. The distance, once widening, closed quickly, and I managed to successfully climb onto the ship’s deck.
And…
“Kill him!”
The enemy didn’t surrender at the sight of me.
The battle begins.
They’re a Clan from the 6th tier, so they’re not easy.
But…
‘What are they going to do if they can’t handle me?’
The outcome is already decided.
Erwen, in her [Spirit Form], circles around me, eliminating them one by one. 
I protect her.
If I get seriously injured…
Splash!
I’ll just dive and come back up again.
After doing this three times, the enemy loses their will to fight and drops their weapons, surrendering.
From fifteen, they’re down to seven.  More than half are dead.
“Tsk tsk, they have no sense of self-preservation.  Just throwing their lives away.”
“We’re sorry. Please, spare our lives…”
What are you talking about? You’re already dead.
Crunch!
The captain slams his head against the deck as he surrenders, and I smash my hammer down on it.
I tie up the rest of the crew and seize control of the ship.
“Who’s the navigator?”
“I, I am!”
Whew, good, the navigator is alive.
“Hey, you’re a mage, right?”
“…”
“Just nodding?  Don’t you want to answer?”
“Y, Yes. I’m a mage…”
I separate the one remaining mage.
“I see the tattoo.  You were the one who piloted the other ship?”
“Th, That’s right.”
I separate the one who owned the other two ships, excluding the flagship.
And…
“As for the two of you…”
“…”
“Go.”
“What? Go from the ship… where?”
Where else?
Crunch, Crunch!
The two remaining are useless, so I take care of them quickly.
Then I go to the rear of the ship and check its condition.
The magic propulsion system is in ruins.
“Damn it.”
My anger is genuine.
“You guys, you destroyed my ship like this…!”
“We, We’re sorry.”
“If an apology was enough, why would we need laws?”
“…”
Everyone hangs their heads and bows in silence at my words.  
Whew, what’s the point of yelling at them…
Splash-splash.
I hear a splashing sound coming from the bottom of the ship.
‘Huh? What’s that…?’
I lean on the railing to check below.
And…
“Ah.”
Amelia is there.
Did she actually swim here?
“…She must be shipwrecked!”
I shout, throwing a rope down. Amelia grabs it, and I pull her onto the deck.
And…
“Shwitz, you’re really…!”
“Yeah?”
“Just take one.”
She punches me in the chest.
