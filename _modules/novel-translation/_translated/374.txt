## Treasure Hunter (2)
Thirteen hours had passed since we entered the Labyrinth. We were inside the first-floor Crystal Cave. The reason we were still on the first floor, a level we previously traversed in just a few hours with only three of us, was simple: our current expedition plan began here.
"Hmm, this is the first time I've seen a rift opened this way," said Amelia, her voice a mix of curiosity and excitement.
"Hehe, you really do know everything, don't you?" Erwin chimed in, her tone full of playful admiration.
The first floor had four different rift types: Blood Citadel, Ice Cave, and the others. These rifts could be opened by players, but the process required specific actions.  Our delay was due to our earlier ascent to the second floor, where we hunted down level-8 monsters.
"By this time, everyone else would have moved on," I thought, taking out the level-8 magic stone I had stored in my subspace ring. "This place feels familiar."
This hollow space, roughly thirty meters in diameter, held a single stone monument. It was here, during the chaos of the dimensional rift, that the remaining players had sought a way out, huddled together after the army and major clans had fled.  However, back then, the area had been expanded by mages, creating a much more expansive space. 
"So, everyone ready?" I asked, and both Amelia and Erwin nodded. I placed the magic stone before the monument, almost like an offering. 
And then, it happened.
Drrrrrr!
The monument vibrated, sending tremors throughout the first floor. A green portal appeared, swirling with luminescent energy.
“Character has entered the Level 1 rift.”
Time to go.
***
Shooosh!
The green light revealed the cave's interior.  Iron rails snaked across the ground, while discarded wooden debris littered the area. It was a bit more eerie than in the game.
[Green Mine]
This was one of the four rift types on the first floor. The path forward was straightforward: start at the point where the ceiling collapsed and follow the rails,  exploring the mine until you defeat the guardian.
“What are you all doing? Let's go."  I urged Amelia and Erwin, who were inspecting the surroundings, towards the tunnel. We needed to keep moving. There was a high probability more players would enter soon, and it was best to avoid any encounters. 
Amelia and I might be able to blend in, but Erwin had become quite famous in this city. Even low-level explorers were likely to recognize her.
Tap. Tap.
Once we were out of the portal's light, Erwin summoned a dark spirit, using it to shroud our bodies. Only then did a wave of players enter the rift.
"W-Whoa!"
The first one was a man in low-level gear. 
“What? What is this? Am I the first?"  He gawked around, seemingly realizing he had entered the rift, and then broke into a wide grin.
And then….
"Oopsie!"
A second person stumbled out of the portal and crashed onto the floor.  This one was a man, too. 
"H-H-Hi!”
Okay, both of them are guys.  No problems for now.
I watched them exchange awkward greetings, then turned away. 
"The sound won't reach them from here. Let's run."
"Okay!”
We started running through the tunnels, beginning our rift assault. The first monster we encountered was, unsurprisingly, a goblin.  But this one was different from those we’d seen on the first two floors.
[Grrr!]
It was about the same height as the usual goblins, but its body was far more developed.  A broad back, densely packed with sturdy muscles.  It even wore a miner's helmet and a pickaxe slung over its shoulder.
"A goblin miner."
Level-8. A creature that only provides experience within the first-floor rift.
[Kyaa-ack!]
The muscular creature spotted us and, ignoring the three-to-one odds, charged at us, pickaxe raised.  Its attack was much more forceful than that of a typical goblin.
But….
“That’s so gross.”
What’s wrong with it?
Just one of us would be enough to clear this first-floor rift.
Poooof!
Without even bothering to draw her bow, Erwin pierced the goblin’s forehead with a wind spirit.
"Goblin Miner defeated. EXP +2"
One shot, one kill.
It was nothing unusual for our level, but the process - her pointed finger aiming at the target followed by a blast of compressed air - was quite impressive.
"Is that... tanji-gong?"
I had been a big fan of martial arts novels once upon a time.
"Man, I wish I could learn that one."
"Shui-ts, is something wrong?"
"No, you were staring at me so intensely."
“It’s nothing. Let's go."
I quickly dismissed my thoughts and moved forward.  If I were to compare my current state to a martial arts novel, I would be like an external kung fu master who has achieved the realm of Indestructible Diamond Body.
Tap, tap.
From that point onwards, I led the way, guiding our path through the tunnels.  Well, to be honest, it was pretty much a straight line for the early part of the mine.
“Why did we stop?”
"Because the rails end here. We’re probably at the point."
While scanning the ground, I noticed a damaged spot in the rails and stopped.
And then…
Kwaaang-!
I smashed the surrounding walls with my hammer.
Amelia was worried we were going to be buried alive, but her worries were unfounded.  How often did you see a rift field crumble so easily?  Cracked walls usually hid something.
Just like this.
Kwee-jee-jik-!
The wall collapsed as easily as a stack of styrofoam boxes.  A narrow passage, just barely wide enough for one person, was revealed.
"I almost couldn't have fit here before I shrunk."
"Ugh, my shoulder's still hitting."
I had no choice but to turn sideways and enter the passage with a crab-like shuffle.
And then…
"Looks like I just earned three million stone."
I picked up a green jewel from a small chest hidden inside the passage, then repeated the process and exited.
“I never knew there was anything like this in the mine."
"But, Master… there’s no mage. How are you going to take it out?"
“Don’t worry.  These kind of items usually don’t require distortion magic.”
Think back to the Blood Citadel on the first floor.  Only the debris, the bricks and building decorations, were marked as requiring distortion magic. 
Anything valuable, like the Necronomicon, received item recognition, allowing it to be taken out of the portal…  Ah, right, she wasn’t there then.
“Let’s go. We’ve got everything we need.”
Anyway, that was all there was to the first chapter’s hidden piece.  I focused on moving forward, ignoring the ground, and soon enough, we reached a cliff.  
A bridge, missing more than two-thirds of its structure, and the rails along with it. The usual strategy was to take the side tunnel and go around, but...
"If I still had [Jump], I could just skip this."
I missed my mobility skills.  This section was meant to be skipped with any intermediate or higher-level mobility skill.
"It's a waste of time to go that way anyway. There are just goblin miners over there."
We took the side passage, even though it wasn't a hidden piece route.  We cleared the goblin miners along the way and exited the other side. 
That took about thirty minutes, right?
"It’s easy, for a level 1 rift.”
"It’s definitely not what I expected."
Erwin seemed to dislike the boring exploration, but it was inevitable.  We were hunting on level 7 with level 7 members, but we were in a level 1 rift.  In a typical RPG game, it usually doesn't even give you experience points.
Ah, but isn’t it a cruel system that you have to go all the way back to a low-level hunting ground for experience?
“Don't be disappointed.  We’re leaving soon.”
Everyone seemed bored, so I decided to speed up the rift assault.  We passed the tunnel beyond the bridge, where we had to go around, and cleared all the monsters that appeared from the second chapter onwards.
"Hobgoblin Miner defeated +EXP 3"
“Mineral Slime defeated +EXP 2”
“Copper Golem defeated +EXP 3”
Those were the new monsters we encountered in the second chapter.
Ah, we need to add the mid-boss too.
“Goblin Bomber defeated +EXP 4”
Of course, no essence this time.
Well, we don't have any vials or a mage to carry them anyway.
"The second chapter was all about combat, so it was over quickly."
I cleared the mid-boss in about ten minutes and then searched for any hidden pieces.  They usually appear when you smash the minerals around the mid-boss room. 
[Gobo Quartz]
Oh, I found three.
"Let’s share them."
I was about to distribute the Gobo Quartz, but Amelia and Erwin frowned.
"You’re... eating that?"
"It smells weird. It feels sticky."
"But it's a potion. It increases your poison resistance."
"If that’s the case…"
Amelia, a native of Noirk, seemed used to all sorts of strange flavors.  She swallowed the Gobo Quartz first, followed by Erwin, who shut her eyes tight as she put it in her mouth.
"Is it that bad?"
“…It tastes like nothing."
"The texture is quite unique."
"Oh, really?"
The texture, well, it was unique.  No need to mentally prepare for that, I guess.
Crunsh!
I crunched on the Gobo Quartz with my molars and, surprisingly, it felt really odd.  It was soft on the outside, but the inside was like chewing on a rock.  It wasn't that unusual for Barbarians, who usually chew on bones.
"Character has consumed Gobo Quartz."
“Poison Resistance permanently increased by +3”
“This effect cannot be duplicated.”
Anyway, the rest of the rift assault went pretty much the same.  We cleared all the monsters we saw, and only stopped to search when we thought there might be a hidden piece.
We descended the circular stairs, built at the edge of the cliff, and completed the third chapter.
And then…
“The final boss.”
We reached the deepest part of the mine.  A collapsed tunnel, like something that had been sealed, stood before us.  Normally, you'd have to find hidden explosives around the mine and use them to open the path.
But high-level players have their own tricks.
Bang. Bang!
I used the Kraul's Demolisher to smash the foundation stones below and the wall crumbled, revealing a passage. We entered.
"The sleeping Green King awakens."
A spacious hollow, about fifty meters in diameter.  Green slime churned in the center, letting out a guttural roar.
[Kyu-eee-it-!]
The guardian of [Green Mine], King Slime.
***
At that moment, at the entrance of the rift.
Two men shivered, lit only by a single flickering torch in the deep darkness.
"Are we really supposed to go in there… just the two of us?"
"What else can we do?  The portal’s closed."
“I thought you had to go in there with five people.  What is going on?"
The axe warrior’s question prompted the archer to sigh. 
Even he didn't know what was going on. Why was the portal closed when there were only two of them in the rift?
At first, they thought it was a temporary bug. 
But the portal remained closed, and they waited for three hours, unsure if anyone else would enter. 
They couldn't keep denying reality forever.
"Fine, let’s go.  If we’re going to clear this rift with just the two of us, we need to start slowly."
"...Alright."
The axe warrior, who was a bit of a wimp despite his size, took the lead, and the archer followed closely behind.
"This damned bug-infested game."
The archer thought of himself as lucky.  Well, he had accidentally discovered the game and ended up here, but other than that, his life had been pretty smooth sailing, even after he woke up in this strange world.  Just look at his first expedition.
He had gotten an essence right from the start, and in the second expedition, he had plundered the equipment of both the explorer and the raider, getting his initial capital. He had grown steadily based on that foundation.
But….
"It’s my third expedition, I'm here in a level 1 rift, and now this crap happens.”
He grumbled to himself, but kept his mind sharp.
He had to survive.
“…Wait, stop.”
“What is it?”
"Something’s off. We should have encountered a goblin miner by now."
"You... seem to know a lot about rifts."
"I just know a little.  I’m a big fan of learning."
He didn’t want to tell the truth. 
He was a veteran player of the original version.  Sure, he had quit after failing the early parts, only to later discover the cheat version and clear it, but he knew the early game inside out because he had played the original.  
To play it properly, you had to read Elfnunalove’s 'Newbie Guide’ over and over again.  The original version’s difficulty was insane.
“…Alright, let’s go.  I don't know why we haven’t seen any goblins yet."
But, there was no point in waiting, so he resumed their advance, treating it as a mismatch between the game and reality.
And then…
"Oh, look!  There’s a tunnel behind the collapse!"
They reached the spot where the rails were broken. There was a hole in the wall.
“Someone else came first."
“What did you say?”
"Nothing. I was talking to myself."
Someone else had entered the rift before them.  Definitely three of them.
"That means... the monsters have been cleared too." 
He felt a wave of relief wash over him, and his legs felt weak.  
As the relief subsided, he began to see it as an opportunity.
"There are no signs of combat around here.  This means they’re strong enough to have completely wiped them all out.”
They probably weren’t interested in the level 1 rift essence.  And the essence’s drop timer was about thirty minutes.  If they hurry, they might be able to collect the abandoned essence from the latter part of the rift.  Maybe they could even collect the hidden pieces they missed.
“Let’s go!  Ignore the monsters.”
"...What do you mean?”
"I think there won’t be any monsters ahead.  If you don’t believe me, I can go first."
The archer sprinted through the dark tunnel.
But...
"They took the Gobo Quartz."
There was nothing left in the second and third chapters.  The people who came before them were so good at this rift that there was nothing left behind.
"I didn’t even know this was here...  I guess there was something hidden inside." 
Anyway, he sprinted for a long time and finally reached the last boss room.  It took him about forty minutes.
If the boss’s essence had dropped and they hadn’t picked it up...
"It might still be here."
He walked into the boss room with the axe warrior.
And then…
Shooosh!
They saw the essence floating in the air and their eyes lit up with greed.  
But there was a difference.
"It’s... the essence!"
“Yes, it is.”
“I-Is that the guardian’s essence?”
The axe warrior’s eyes were more surprised than greedy, but the archer’s were the opposite. 
Pooof!
The archer nocked an arrow and shot it into the axe warrior’s shoulder.
"Aaargh!"
The axe warrior screamed and rolled on the ground.  He tried to grab his axe, but it fell from his hand. 
Clang.
"It’s useless.  There’s paralyzing poison on the arrowhead.”
“W-Why are you doing this! If you want the essence, I’ll give it to you! P-Please!”
The axe warrior, sensing his defeat, pleaded with the archer.  
But the archer’s eyes were cold.
"Why are you so concerned with your life, you NPC?"
"E-NPC? What do you mean? Wait…  Dragoon!  Please!  I have a daughter at home.”
“Dragoons are Protoss.”
The archer chuckled and pulled out the arrowhead.
And then…
“Hans Eleven.”
"…"
"That's my name.  Oh, right, it’s not my real name.”
“Y-You wouldn't…!”
"You figured it out.  Sorry.  I had to tell you before I got soft.”
“A-No!”
The axe warrior tried to say something, but he couldn’t finish his sentence.  The arrowhead pierced his neck before he could. 
"It’s no different from killing a goblin."
The archer quickly stood up and walked towards the essence, a sinister smile playing on his lips. 
"I’m so lucky."
He genuinely thought he was lucky.
"Character’s soul absorbs [Slime Essence]."
Until he saw the new skill.
