## Chapter 468: Master of the Land (3)
Before pursuing a lawsuit against the Count of Alminus, the first step was a public relations campaign. Why?  Even if they filed a lawsuit, it was certain they'd win and receive their share of the loot through the ruling. My conclusion was this: "The Count of Alminus doesn't want to take this case to the courts."
If this assumption was correct, then the lawsuit was likely just a gesture, a threat, or perhaps something in between. It felt like a message: "You and I are on different levels. If you don't want to lose more, cooperate and give up what you need to."
Surely a figure like the Count of Alminus wouldn't be desperate for money. It must be about face. After all, that's what I'd observed in the aristocratic society I'd witnessed, however short my experience may have been. Here, there were only victors and losers. And to simply ignore this incident would be the most undeniable sign of defeat. 
Therefore, I decided to turn public opinion.  After all, what was it they were trying to engrave most deeply in people's minds? "The former Baron Jandel lacked the capability to defeat the Tier Boss." "If not for the Jagged Tooth Clan, they never would have been able to defeat the Tier Boss."  While these claims had some truth to them, the Count was trying to solidify these ideas in the public consciousness. 
It was a kind of groundwork. It started with questioning capabilities, but soon harsher accusations would emerge. "Bjorn Jandel stole the credit from the Jagged Tooth Clan who toiled and bled to resolve the disaster." "Is this the kind of behavior we expect from a hero?"  The Count had cleverly recognized that the foundation of Baron Jandel's power lay in his reputation.
"Hmm, so you're saying they filed the extermination request without a word to us?" 
"...That's right!"
Amelia's cold gaze met mine as soon as I revealed the raid plan upon returning home.  It wouldn't last long, as usual.
"Sigh..."
With a sigh like that of a parent dealing with their troublesome child, Amelia immediately began looking for solutions.
"Do you even know how many clans have disappeared trying to take down a Tier Boss with just five people?"
"I've heard. It's especially dangerous with just five.  That's why clans usually form groups of twenty to thirty..."
As a side note, that number is based on groups of adventurers who have reached levels six or seven. But...
"Don't worry. I have a plan."
It's customary to clear a King of Fear raid with five members. That's how you get the best rewards. The rewards are quite well-known, and many clans periodically try to achieve this feat.  Not many, though. Maybe two or three per century? 
"Actually, if you know the strategy, clearing it with five is much easier than with thirty."
That's why I set the next exploration target to be a King of Fear raid. The people here consider a five-member King of Fear raid to be much more difficult than a Lyakis raid.  As soon as we succeed, those who doubt my abilities will disappear.
"..."
I noticed Auyen fidgeting, silently listening to our family meeting.  I briefly wondered why she was here, but didn't say anything.  She did help a lot this time, after all.
"Rokrok."
"Yes, Baron. What is it?"
I told her what she was secretly hoping for.
"You can skip this raid, so don't worry."
"Ah… Really? That’s... great..."
Auyen breathed a sigh of relief, her face openly expressing her relief.
"Then who will take the last spot?"
After sending Auyen back to her room, we began discussing the raid strategy, starting with who to choose for the remaining member.  The conversation was winding down.
"Jandel."
Amelia caught me as I was about to leave for my room.
"You seem to be making enemies lately...  Are you pushing yourself too hard?"
She was saying I was being too reckless. I understood her concern. They were one of the oldest masters of this land.  It would be uncomfortable for her to keep getting into conflicts with them, whether it was about their noble status or their role as tribal leaders.  But...
"Amelia."
I stood my ground and replied.
"If you're too afraid of competition to build your multi-bases, you'll ultimately lose the game."
It was a belief I had held for a long time.
"..."
Amelia stared at me with an expression that seemed to ask, "What kind of nonsense is he spouting now?"
***
The next day, I went out with Erwen, just the two of us. We were headed for Raven's lab in the Magic Tower.
"Ah, you're here?"
"Long time no see, Raven."
"I heard you became a Baron. Congratulations. I tried to visit you several times, but you were never around."
"I've been quite busy lately."
The lab was as cluttered as ever, covered in dust. It felt like ages since I last visited.
"...It's a bit messy, isn't it? I've been staying at the army base in the Imperial City most of the time. This is my first time coming back to the lab in ages."
"Thank you. I wouldn't have expected you to take time off to come here."
"Of course. This is a chance to see a Tier Boss essence. If I had just said it, all the mages would have lined up!"
Hmm, she wasn't wrong. Still, there's no mage I trust as much as her.  Versil Goul-land specializes in magical devices, but he said he wasn't comfortable with essences.
"After receiving your call, I've been studying Lyakis' essence a bit more. It's quite peculiar."
"It is, indeed."
"Now, shall we…? "
Raven gave a mischievous smile as she approached, prompting Erwen to take a step back. She then turned to me.
"...Uncle, can't we just do it together? Like we used to?"
Erwen seemed displeased at being treated like a test subject, but there was no way around it.
"Like I said, a mage's assistance is essential to fully understand the power you've acquired."
"..."
"Can you do it?"
"Yes..."
Erwen nodded after I persuaded her.
Raven chuckled at this sight.
"...Erwen-ssi is still the same."
"That's none of your business."
"Well, that's true. Come over here."
Ugh, this is suffocating.
We used to call each other by name and were pretty friendly.  But just my return wasn't enough to make everything go back to how it was.  Too many things had changed between us.
"Still, Raven seemed to harbor some lingering affection for me back then, considering she tried to keep me away from Erwen because she thought I was trying to exploit her..."
Ah, I don't know. They'll figure it out.  It's ridiculous that I'm worried while they're nonchalant, so I just focused on the experiment.
"Now, put on this bracelet."
It was the same bracelet I wore during the Corpse Golem essence experiment.  Can you even call it a bracelet?
"...Ugh."
As soon as Erwen sat down on the strange-looking chair, the bracelet (or whatever you call it) on the chair clicked shut.
"Don't worry. We're just placing a magic conductor into your veins to check your vital signs while you're in this state."
"..."
"Should we start the rest?"
Raven continued with various preparations for the actual experiment. Once she was done, she asked Erwen to use her ability.
"It might be difficult since it's your first time, but try to imagine it clearly. Thinking of the name of the ability given by the Great Sage will make it easier—."
"I'll do it on my own. Just be quiet. Let me focus."
"Okay. Well, I'm a mage, but you're the expert in this, Erwen-ssi."
Erwen closed her eyes. It didn't take a few seconds for changes to appear. 
Beep, beep, bee-bee-bee, beep - The vital sign graph connected to Erwen started to fluctuate wildly.  Her essence ability had properly activated...
「Erwen Fornaci di Tersia has activated [Fusion] 」
First of all, [Fusion] is a Transformation ability. It's similar to my [Transcendence], but different.  
[Transcendence] affects other active skills, while - 
「All passive skills are merged into one. 」
[Fusion] only targets passive skills.
"I wonder how it turned out."
I recalled each of Erwen's passive skills.
「The chaotic energy devours [Attribute Enhancement].」
Rank 5 Evan's essence. It boosts the damage of the four basic attributes, commonly known as Water, Fire, Wind, and Earth.
「The chaotic energy devours [Absolute Focus].」
Rank 4 Ritcanon's essence, acquired from a royal reward. It doubles the damage of casting skills.
「The chaotic energy devours [Harmony].」
Rank 5 Ertes the Patrol's essence. It allows you to convert your soul power into natural energy.
「The chaotic energy devours [Half Blessing].」
Rank 5 Kalvan the Wolf Beast's essence. It periodically activates and deactivates a doping-type buff at regular intervals.
「The chaotic energy devours [Eyes of the Pursuer].」
Rank 4 Metkrow's essence. It triples all stats related to vision and applies a modifier to all ranged attacks.
And finally.
「The chaotic energy devours [Food Chain].」
Rank 3 Monster Celestial Judge's essence, acquired after my team disbanded and thanks to the support of the Elven tribe. 
All damage dealt to monsters is increased in proportion to your level.  Though not as powerful as its active [Burst], its passive skill is also incredibly valuable.
"The Tier Boss essence isn't included in [Fusion], so that's it."
By the way, even I don't know exactly what will happen when these skills are combined.  There are so many essences in [Dungeon & Stone]!  No matter how hard I try, it's physically impossible to test every possible combination.  I'm not a cheat version, either.
"...Well, I've pretty much tried all the combinations based on higher-rank essences."
I've found a few good combinations.  But completing this combination will take a long time.  So, what new options have we got?
「Erwen Fornaci di Tersia's body is infused with chaotic energy.」
To accurately identify this option, I needed a mage's assistance.  I don't see system logs.
"How do you feel? Do you feel anything different?"
"I don't know."
"Really? Then let's check one by one by adjusting the conditions."
Raven continued with the experiment, similar to the one I went through before. Of course, this experiment couldn't be finished in just a day.
"I've taken the entire month off, so come here every day from now on."
Erwen's schedule for this month was set.
***
「Erwen Fornaci di Tersia's body is infused with chaotic energy.」
「Soul power and natural energy are greatly increased in proportion to the character's level.」
「When dealing attribute damage to monsters below Rank 4, they receive additional damage of the Chaos attribute.」
「While concentrating, all damage received is absorbed using soul power.」
***
Even after visiting the Magic Tower, my busy schedule continued.
[There's already a lot of talk about you lately. Don't worry, I'll help. That will quell the rumors.]
I received assurance from the low-level adventurers I met in this dungeon that they would help if I needed their testimony later.
[I think there was a fierce battle at the top of the Dragon Mountains. One of the Seven Kings died in that battle. Oh, and there's one more thing you need to know—.]
I checked on the war-related information and general news from Versil Goul-land.
[Bjorn!! Let's go to the Sacred Land! We need you!]
I visited the Sacred Land after a problem arose within my tribe.
[…Isn't it less than a month yet? How much do you know about blacksmithing? You need to build facilities before you can properly melt Mistyium... What? You're not rushing? Don't lie!]
I visited the dwarf's forge to check on the progress of disposing of loot and melting metal.  Those gauge bars in idle games need to be clicked frequently to complete faster.
"...It's already half a month?"
My body grew weary with each passing day. As I returned home late at night, I fell onto the bed and closed my eyes. I wasn't trying to rest after a long day. I had one more task to complete before facing tomorrow.
「The character's soul resonates and is drawn to a specific world.」
...Let's go.
