The Point of Capture (3)
In the Barbarian sanctuary, the battle cries are a constant companion, heard thousands of times a day.  Whether eating, chopping wood, or simply idle, the war cries of "Behella!" echoed ceaselessly.  This constant barrage allowed Lotmiller to discern subtle differences between the seemingly identical shouts; each held a unique quality. This particular cry had three distinct characteristics: the low pitch of the initial "Be," the noticeable intake of breath between "Hel" and "La," and most importantly, it was a woman’s voice.
“Ainar…?” he mused.
His conjecture proved correct. Lotmiller turned towards the source of the sound and spotted Ainar on the balcony of the four-story building.
With a powerful whoosh, a pair of wings unfurled behind her.  The female warrior, easily recognizable even from a distance, held a magnificent, richly hued green halberd.
“It’s… Ainar! A divine weapon!” someone exclaimed.
“I thought she was supposed to be near the plaza!” another voice added.
Ainar’s presence there remained a mystery, but the reason was inconsequential. What mattered was the dramatically increased likelihood of resolving their predicament.
With a resounding boom, Ainar leaped from the rooftop, landing gracefully beside the madly careening cart.
“Hee-hee-hing!” she cried, her voice echoing the frantic pace of the arrow-stricken horse.  “Tell me, guide. What should I do?”
The question, characteristically Barbarian in its blunt directness, cut to the chase.
“I'm not very bright, so you tell me. How do I save Bjorn Yandel?”
The brief query conveyed profound trust.  Lotmiller’s heart swelled with emotion, but he suppressed his feelings, striving for composure.  Trust earned demanded reciprocity.
“If we reach the city walls, the royal army is highly likely to assist. Therefore—”
“Keep it concise.”
“Clear the path ahead!”
“…Simple enough.”
Instantly, upon Lotmiller’s command, Ainar surged forward.  With a series of swift thrusts and slashes of her green halberd, she cut down the obstructing enemies.  Her wings beat powerfully behind her, her halberd finding its mark with each strike.  Watching from behind, Lotmiller almost believed a warrior had been sent from the heavens to save Bjorn Yandel.
“Behellaaaaaaaaaaa!!!”
The enemy, now thoroughly cowed, dared not impede her progress, allowing the cart to accelerate.  The closer they got to the walls, the faster they moved. But the road would not remain clear to the very end.
A man suddenly appeared, seemingly having materialized in front of the cart, despite the enemy’s earlier retreat. Lotmiller didn’t recognize him, but…
Ainar, whose face had been etched with a cheerful determination, now wore a grim expression, her voice dropping to a low murmur.
“I must go alone from here.  Please save Yandel, guide.”
Ainar said this as she ran. At that instant, the world plunged into darkness, a chilling wave of cold washing over Lotmiller's skin, as if night had fallen.
“Roland Banozant has activated [Black Eyes].”
Hundreds of chilling eyes glowed amidst the city’s oppressive darkness, and time seemed to grind to a halt, except for two individuals.
“You've come at a good time,” a male voice said, the speaker casually approaching, his eyes radiating an uncanny light.
“Behellaaaaaaaaaaa!!!” Ainar cried out, thrusting her halberd.  The weapon, propelled by a powerful gust of wind, struck empty air.  Yet, unexpectedly...
With a sizzling sound, the darkness shattered, and time resumed its flow.
“Kugh…”  The nonchalant man stumbled backward, clearly taken aback by the unexpected blow. Ainar, seizing the opportunity, charged toward him, shouting,
“Go…!”
Lotmiller urged the cart forward.  He hadn't actually done much; the horse, now frenzied, had bolted the moment the darkness lifted. His only contribution had been to guide the animal’s direction.
The cart rumbled onward.  Behind them, the sounds of superhuman conflict continued, but Lotmiller didn’t look back. His entire focus was on reaching the city walls with this cart.
But…
“Seize him!”
“Stop them!”
The moment Ainar disappeared, the previously subdued soldiers renewed their pursuit.  The problem was…
‘Damn it.’
The cart was slowing down. It was only natural. Even with wheels, carrying such a massive Barbarian and a grown man, after having traveled this far, its power inevitably waned.
Lotmiller released the reins and shifted to the cart's side, firing his crossbow at the pursuing soldiers.  It wasn't particularly effective; he wasn't a powerhouse like Ainar.
“Just ordinary arrows, no abilities!”
“He’s nothing special!”
Those who had been routed by Ainar now proved significantly more challenging for Lotmiller.  While not all of them were equally formidable, his crossbow bolts occasionally found their mark.
“Seize him…!”
The distance between the cart and its pursuers rapidly closed.  A decision was needed, but there was no time for calm deliberation.
“My arrows are gone!”
His crossbow was empty. And then…
A magical attack pierced his right shoulder, rendering his right arm useless.  Staying in the cart now only added weight.
A thousand thoughts raced through his mind.  Was this the end? When he arrived at the sanctuary, he felt more story remained. Was this truly his story's end?
No, it wasn’t. There was one way.  He could throw the massive Barbarian from the cart and save himself. They were hunting Yandel, not him.  The cart would reach the walls, and he would live.  But…
‘Now I understand,’ he thought. Even when he sensed death in the sanctuary, he hadn't understood the emotions driving his magician friend's final decision. He had only guessed; he hadn't truly understood. Now, he did.
‘Even with fear—’ like the Barbarians entering the labyrinth, laughing despite the hardship; ‘there was no escape.’
Like a gentle breeze clearing the fog, his mind cleared. Dwalki wasn't a great man; he was ordinary, just like himself.  He feared death, like any normal person; he yearned for life, plagued by regrets and mistakes.  He wished to escape and rectify his errors, yet he didn’t.  He did his best, and as a result, saved everyone.
‘Yes…’  Without him, this story would have ended much sooner.  His hesitation felt absurd. Therefore…
“Excuse me, but I must go alone from now on.”
He offered this final farewell, though the unconscious man wouldn't hear it. Was he truly ordinary?  With a lingering sense of regret, he retrieved a pen from his [Treasure Trove].
He quickly scribbled a message on his calloused palm.  The situation demanded brevity, but it was enough to resolve his lingering anxieties. Perhaps even his final message was selfish...
‘A little selfishness is permissible.’
Trading the pen for a dagger, Lotmiller leaped from the cart, plunging his dagger into the oncoming attackers, again and again.
"What the hell is this guy?"
Hot steel tore through his body.  The creaking of the cart's wheels grew fainter.  He didn't need to look back to know; the cart would continue on its path, towards those lofty city walls.
He awoke as if refreshed by a deep sleep. His body ached, but his mind was clear. He felt he’d had a long dream, yet he couldn’t recall its content.
“This is…?” he wondered, looking at the ceiling. It seemed to be a barracks.
He slowly sat up, surveying his surroundings. There were no clues to his location. It seemed like a royal army barracks… but why was he here?
“…Lotmiller.”
As he pondered, fragments of his lost memories began to coalesce. The thunder, his survival, and the presence of Lotmiller beside him…
‘What… what happened?’ he thought, utterly confused.  He needed information about his current circumstances.
As he was about to get up, a knight entered the barracks. The face was familiar.
“……Astarotta?”
Astarotta Verun, the King’s Knight, a temporary ally who, along with Raven, had disappeared after being dragged to the ‘Netherworld’ by the Corpse Collector.
“You're finally awake.”
“Why am I here? Where’s Raven?”
“One question at a time.”  A rather chilly greeting for someone just waking up.
“Where’s Raven?”
“She’s safe. Don’t worry. She’ll be here soon.”
Ah, that's good.
“Tell me. Where am I, and why am I here?”
“We’re in the imperial capital, Carnon. The reason you, a Baron, are in a tent fit for a soldier is for security.”
“Security?”
“Another thunderbolt will strike if your location is revealed.”
“…What?”
“The Regent’s blood is boiling.  He keeps firing thunderbolts the moment your location is confirmed.”
Ah, so it was the Baron who fired it.  Important information, yes, but not what he asked.
“Astarotta, I’m not curious about why I’m in this tent, but about everything that happened while I was unconscious.”
“Oh, was that it?”
Astarotta wore an unaffected expression, then related the events. In short, a second thunderbolt had struck, and the Fifth Legion Commander, Baron Wilkins, had used an ancient magic array in the city.  The ancient magic was a summoning spell with a lengthy casting time, and the hurried activation caused side effects. The side effect? The summoning coordinates were randomized…
“So everyone there was randomly teleported across the city?”
“Better than all dying, right?”
True, but…
“So I luckily landed here?”
“No chance. You landed in the heart of enemy territory, the Fourth Ward. Someone else brought you, unconscious, to the imperial capital.”
“A man… Lotmiller!  Are you talking about Brown Lotmiller?”
“Probably.”
“What happened to Lotmiller?”
He anxiously inquired about his well-being. Astarotta calmly replied,
“He’s dead.”
“…What?”
“According to witnesses at the city walls, when the cart slowed, he jumped out to fend off the attackers.”
Oh…
“By the way, Ainar Pnellin, who helped you escape with him, was captured and taken prisoner.”
Lotmiller dead, Ainar captured…?  His head swam with information.
Astarotta chuckled.  “You’re far more delicate than you appear. I’ll leave you to process this. Oh, and one last thing…”
“…?”
“Your palm.”
With that cryptic statement, Astarotta left, leaving him to stare blankly at the cot. He raised his arm, turning his palm upwards. A hastily scribbled message was there, and the words hit home.
[Be kind to Shabin. She's a good woman.]
It wasn’t a dream.
