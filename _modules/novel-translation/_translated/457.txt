## Chapter 457: Raid (2)
"Oh! Quite intriguing—."
Just as Einar bent over and reached out, I roared, "Stop!"
I restrained Einar, who was taken aback by my sudden shout. Only after I had pushed her away to a safe distance did I exhale a sigh of relief.
"W-what’s going on? I didn’t do anything wrong!!" Einar protested, clueless about the situation.
Of course, I had no intention of scolding her.
"Wh-what exactly is this flower that you're making such a fuss over?"
Ignorance is no sin.  Well, at least not for a Barbarian.
“It’s No. 9999, the Beginner’s Luck.”
Only one person, Amelia, reacted when I revealed the object’s name.
“…So you’ve obtained a valuable item from the very start.”
Indeed, it is valuable.  This is something you can’t buy even with money. 
“So, what exactly is it?”
“Hmm… It’s one of the 109 treasures of the Labyrinth. Didn’t you read books well when you were young?”
“….I didn’t ask you.”
I couldn’t say I knew what the 109 treasures Amelia mentioned were, but I intervened to answer before they started fighting.
“Beginner’s Luck is a charm item.”
It was listed in the game as “Charm,” by the way.
“A charm…?”
Since it seemed like an unfamiliar term, I first explained the concept of a charm. Erwen, with her explorer experience, quickly grasped the idea.
“Oh, so it’s like equipment that activates simply by possessing it?”
“Exactly.”
By the way, there are a total of twelve charm-type Number items. Even if you possess multiple charms of different types, their effects don’t stack. 
Only one charm’s effect will be activated at a time.
“And Beginner’s Luck has the unique feature of being bound to its first possessor.”
“…Like the ‘Fire Orb’ you mentioned before?”
“Yes.”
“…That can’t be! I really didn’t know!! I swear! Trust me!!”
Einar paled and started making excuses as soon as she heard about the bound item.  But since there was no reason to respond, everyone ignored her and continued the conversation.
“Then what effect does this flower have?”
Ah, that.
It’s simple.
This Number item isn’t particularly helpful in combat.  It doesn’t increase the item level when equipped, nor does it enhance any stats.  However…
“It increases the chance of obtaining an Essence from the first monster you hunt.”
“Oh, is that so… It’s an intriguing item!”
Erwen seemed rather indifferent.  Einar also appeared somewhat deflated.
“What’s with that vague effect? It doesn’t guarantee an Essence! And it only works for the first monster?!”
This wasn’t an unexpected reaction.
They don’t know the exact probabilities.
According to my statistics (which I compiled myself), Beginner’s Luck increases the drop rate by approximately 5%.
By the way, this increase isn’t multiplicative.
It’s a fixed increase. 
For instance, the drop rate for a Guardian’s Essence, which is 33%, would increase by 5% to 38%.
While it may seem like a small increase, it's…
“So, how often does it actually drop?”
Things change completely when you consider the target as an average monster.
It's bound to feel different.
The difference between 33% becoming 38% and 0.01% becoming 5.01%.
“Roughly one in twenty monsters.”
As soon as the rough probability escaped my lips, not only Einar but also Erwen and Amelia looked slightly surprised.
“Re-really? One out of twenty?!”
It was the reaction I somewhat expected.
Even if they don't know the exact drop rates, all explorers have learned through experience. The abysmal drop rate of Essences, which can’t be described as anything less than “atrocious.”
I added further clarification.
“Ah, of course, one in twenty is based on a 9th-grade monster.  I heard the drop rate is a bit higher for higher-grade monsters.”
As monster grades increase, their base drop rate is likely to increase slightly.
There are even monsters among the 3rd grade with a 5% drop rate.
Well, it's just hard to find them, though.
"Indeed... it deserves to be among the 109 treasures."
“It definitely does. Even if it’s the first monster you hunt, with this kind of drop rate, you could earn a fortune by just bringing a mage along.”
“Bjorn… I’m sorry. I didn’t know. I was going to touch it without realizing…”
Suddenly, Einar apologized.  Was she downcast because no one responded to her excuses?  I didn’t really have anything to say, so I just ignored her and focused on the conversation.
Besides, wasn’t the appraisal of the loot already finished?
“So… who gets this?”
It’s time to decide the item’s owner.
It’s a bound item, so you can’t sell it.
“Didn’t you say that even if you only have a Binding spell on it, you don’t have to be the one to hunt it…?”
“It would be most efficient for the person who has killed the fewest monsters to take it.”
As Amelia said, it’s best for the lowest level to take it if you consider efficiency.
And currently, our levels are Amelia at 8, me, Erwen, and Einar at 7.
“Auyen, what’s your Soul Rank now?”
“…Eh? Ah, yes! 6…!”
So, giving it to Auyen, who is level 6, and using it as a totem would be one way to go…
‘But you can’t even bring a non-combatant like her on a real raid. I can’t waste this precious item on her.’
I made my decision.
“Einar, you take this.”
Erwen has experience killing Bellarios, but Einar doesn’t.
And more importantly…
“…Eh? This, for me? I-I’m glad! But Bjorn, you should… ”
Didn’t I say you can only equip one charm at a time?
Of course, I can’t waste an equipment slot.
It’s bound, so I can’t even remove it at will.
"It’s better for you to have it than me. So, take it. Einar."
“Bjo-oo-orn!!!!”
Fortunately, Einar was happy.
***
"The luck enshrined in the flower flows into Einar Pnelin.”

After clearing the Iron Tomb, we immediately headed to the Lair of Beasts.
And…
“Ugh! How much longer do I have to be in this stinking place?! This wasn’t the kind of exploration I had in mind!!”
We spent eight days waiting for the fissure to open.
Of course, considering ‘Beginner’s Luck,’ I couldn't help but think that it might be better to bring a mage along later…
‘But considering the price of the vial, selling it wouldn’t make much profit anyway.’
The only thing we could really earn was the Guardian’s Essence, and I planned to give it to Erwen if we found it, so there was no need to delay.
Well, it turned out to be wishful thinking in the end.
“…Really? We’re really just going to waste time and go up?”
“That’s how it is, so stop complaining.”
As we headed towards the portal on the 8th day, we encountered many exploration teams of intermediate levels.
Explorers like us, doing ‘Fissure Runs.’
The fissure on the 2nd floor doesn’t open after the 7th day, so they went upstairs without hesitation.
“Entered the 3rd floor, Pilgrim’s Path.”
Upon reaching the 3rd floor, we bypassed the Iron Boulder Hill and headed straight for the Orc Settlement to grind.
The monster we were going to hunt was also connected to me.
It was the very same monster that the Dzarwi Clan had raided when the Chaos King was summoned.
It was the Orc Hero.
“Ooo! Then [Enlarge]! Can I use [Enlarge] now?!”
Einar was overjoyed at hearing the target of this route, but in fact, none of us planned to eat its Essence.
[Enlarge] becomes a mere penalty Essence unless you have the [Unification] from the Unliving Inscription.
So, we originally planned to just farm experience or try for a Number item drop and leave.
But…
‘With Beginner’s Luck, we might get one.  I can’t just watch a precious Essence go to waste.’
So, I approached every mage I encountered while gathering the Orc Warlord Stones for the altar, since I was going to offer them.
Thanks to that, I found one.
“Vial…? Of course, I have one… ”
“Good. Once you get the Essence, put it in the vial. I’ll pay you right away.”
“…What nonsense? Who do you think you— ”
“Lewis! Ar-are you mad? You’re talking to Count Jandel!”
“…!!!”
Thanks to my fame score, recruitment was smoother than expected.
I also gained some useful information.
The fissure hasn’t opened on the 3rd floor yet?
‘Okay, so I think we should spend 13 days on the 3rd floor before leaving…’
After that, we continued to grind for the stones.
We all spread out and hunted, and within a day, we gathered all 777 stones.  Then, we found a mage nearby and told him to wait near the stone gathering spot.
"Just in case, don’t come near here until I get back. If the Orc Lord shows up, I won’t be able to protect you.”
“Orc Lord?”
“It’s a 2nd grade monster.”
“2… 2nd grade!”
"Just stay away, and you’ll be safe.”
“Ye-yes, sir… ”
So, that’s all the preparation done.
After explaining how to deal with the Orc Lord if it appeared, I offered the stones to the altar.
“The Warrior’s Vessel has received the Warlord’s Soul.”
“The Warrior’s Vessel has received the Warlord’s Soul.”
“The Warrior’s Vessel has received the Warlord’s Soul... ”
Every stone I placed on the altar disappeared in a flash of light.
“Special Condition - The Overflowing Vessel has been met.”
As if to announce the start of the boss fight, the shell of the statue standing behind the altar began to peel off.
Shhhh.
Thankfully, the Orc Lord statue remained intact.
Well, it was to be expected considering the Orc Lord’s summon rate…
‘But the probability is always nerve wracking.’
It felt like we had overcome one hurdle.
“Everyone, get ready!”
As soon as I shouted to my comrades, who were standing far from the altar…
“The Ancient Hero, Denish, awakens.”
“The Ancient Hero, Belta, awakens.”
“The Ancient Hero, Tarugas, awakens.”
The Orc Hero trio.
The so-called “Hero Tri-balls” broke the statue and rushed out, and the battle began immediately.
[Gull-kaaaaaaaaaa!!!]
“Behel—laaaaaaaaaaaa!!!”
Ax, hammer, sword.
The Hero Tri-balls, each wielding a different weapon, charged towards me.  Thanks to the combination of [Transcendence] and [Enlarge], I didn’t feel like I was at a disadvantage in terms of size.
Woooong-!
And even if I got hit by their weapons because I couldn’t block them, it didn’t hurt that much.
It just felt like my bones were aching a little.
Honestly, I think I could’ve held out for at least a day just taking hits.
But…
‘This is perfect for trying to match moves.’
I didn’t do anything other than take hits, so the battle dragged on.
For a very obvious reason.
Just three 5th-grade monsters.
It’s simply not fair to write them off as mere monsters, because their raid difficulty is quite high.
[Whhhiiiicccckk-!!!]
From the moment the raid began, waves of 7th-grade or lower orcs relentlessly charged from the forest.
Kwaang! Kwaang! Puuung-!
As I briefed them, Einar diligently dealt with them, but as a result, we lost another damage dealer for the boss fight.
Simply put, Erwen and Amelia had to deal with all three of them.
Of course, they have the record of having blown away the Death Worm in the Desert of Rocks in one hit…
“The Ancient Hero, Denish, has used [Agony].”
But these guys are 5th-grade monsters who have 4th-grade Essences, making them high-grade mutations.
And all three of them have different Essences.
“The Ancient Hero, Belta, has used [Divine Battlefield].”
“The Ancient Hero, Tarugas, has used [Protective Shield].”
The Essence combination form to supplement each other's weaknesses and maximize their strengths.
But it doesn't end there.  There’s one more annoying thing about them.
“Erwen Fornacci Di Tersia has used [Concentrated Fire].”
“Denish has used [Control’s Greatsword].”
“The trajectory of ranged attacks is adjusted.”
These guys use Number Items.
“The Orc Shaman has used [Enthusiasm].”
“Denish’s physical resistance is increased threefold fDor 10 seconds.”
And even if they get hit, it’s with a severely reduced amount of damage…
“The Orc Grand Shaman has used [Regeneration Inscription].”
“Tarugas’ natural regeneration ability is greatly increased.”
They even receive healing in real time, showcasing a power that Orc Heroes in the general field couldn’t even dream of.
In effect, a high-grade mutation kill bonus. ‘Number Item drop possible’ feature.  If it weren’t for this feature, there would be no reason to do this raid.
“What are you all doing?! Finish them off already! Didn’t you manage to kill that worm earlier?!”
“It’s not as easy as it sounds!”
"Don’t mind us. Do your thing, Barbarian.”
As soon as they fell into a slightly difficult situation, discord inevitably began…
But they were all professionals.
“Einar! Could you take out the shamans first?”
“Tersia. Focus on the one with the hammer first. I’ll block the one with the sword.”
“Behel—laaaaaaaaa!!!”
As time slowly passed, they realized that this wasn’t going to work.  They gave each other feedback and cooperated, creating opportunities.
"Uwaaaaaaaa!!!”
Even Auyen, who was level 6, diligently swung her weapon near Erwen to help with mopping up the trash.
And finally.
“The Ancient Hero, Belta, has been killed. EXP +5.”
“High-grade Mutation Kill Bonus. EXP +1.”
They managed to take down one of the Tri-balls, and from that point on, the battle turned in their favor, ending quickly.
“The Ancient Hero, Denish, has been killed.”
“High-grade Mutation Kill Bonus. EXP +1.”
“The Ancient Hero, Tarugas, has been killed.”
“High-grade Mutation Kill Bonus. EXP +1.”
Checking the time, the total battle time was about 35 minutes.  It was quite fast considering we were raiding with four people…
“Nothing dropped. After all that hard work… ”
There was zero loot.
No Essences, no Number items.
But what can you do?
This kind of disappointment is something you experience all the time in [Dungeon & Stone].
“Okay, then let’s collect the stones and move on. Ah, Emily. Let that mage know that he can leave now.”
We then farmed the stones ourselves and left the Orc Settlement.
There were no problems until this point.
But…
"Sir…?"
As we stayed near the Witch’s Forest, waiting for the fissure to open on the 13th day…
Something strange started to happen.
“The hut has received the fifth offering.”
“The hut has received the sixth offering.”
“The hut has received the seventh off— ”
The surroundings were illuminated brightly, no longer needing torches.
The ceiling above us was scattering a crimson glow.
“Special Condition - The Seven Offerings have been met.”
Damn, they say that even if a guy falls backward, he’ll still break his teeth.
I don’t know what kind of guy he is, but…
“The Chaos King, Riachis, starts roaming the floor.”
Oh, this is going to be a pain in the ass.
