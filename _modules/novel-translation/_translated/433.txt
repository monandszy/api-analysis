## The Lion’s Return (4)
A tavern in the 7th District, always teeming with explorers. Cheap booze sold at even cheaper prices, with empty bottles rolling around and drunken brawls erupting at every opportunity. 
The door swung open with a bang. In any world, there are always those who love to talk, especially when it pays. 
“Extra! Extra!”
“What is it, newsboy?” 
The burly innkeeper, with a rough appearance, rolled up his sleeves as the boy appeared. “Look here, we don't allow peddlers in this establishment.” 
“No, it's extra! Extra!”
“Extra what? It's just the news about the celebratory feast, I bet.” 
“Ha ha, hey! Do you think we're interested in that, while we're here guzzling down booze from midday?”
“You've been complaining for a while now, haven't you? The whole city's buzzing about something so trivial.”
“Come on, kid, come back when you're older.”
The innkeeper hoisted the boy onto his shoulder and headed toward the entrance. And in that moment...
“You stupid idiots!”
“Ha ha ha!”
“Bjorn Yandel has returned, alive…!”
“Ha ha…?”
Silence descended upon the tavern, though it was fleeting.
“The little brat heard some nonsense and is making a fuss.”
“How can someone who died more than two years ago return?” 
“Besides, he was an evil spirit!” 
“That's why he came back alive, and he's not an evil spirit! While you're all sitting here getting drunk, the whole city's gone crazy over this!”
The boy’s indignant yet truthful cry caught the innkeeper’s attention first. Then…
“Hold on, I want to hear more about that.”
One explorer expressed interest, and the innkeeper lowered the boy.
“Ugh, the smell of alcohol…”
The boy, brushing dust off his crumpled collar, headed to the table where the explorer sat. The explorer tossed a coin toward him, as if paying in advance. “Tell me everything. Bjorn Yandel returned alive? Is this information reliable?” 
“Of course it is! The Iron Chancellor himself acknowledged it, in front of thousands of nobles!”
“…The Iron Chancellor?”
“Well, it's like this, you see…,” the boy trailed off, glancing at the explorers around him, who were pretending not to be listening intently. With a sigh, those nearby tossed coins as well.
And so, the story began. It was a tale that, without the embellishments of the gifted storyteller, could have been summarized quite concisely.
“So… Bjorn Yandel's supposed death was a cover-up to carry out a royal mission, and the claim that he was an evil spirit was just a necessary part of that mission, right?”
“More importantly, isn't Lihen Shwietz the one called ‘The Man of Blood Spirit’?”
“The leader of this expedition!”
“I wondered why someone so obscure was leading all those important figures.”
The return of a hero, still etched in people's memories after all this time. Intrigued, the explorers in the tavern eagerly paid to hear about the celebratory feast and all that had transpired there.
How much time had passed?
콰아앙-!
A crash came from the table in the furthest corner, drawing the attention of the explorers.
터벅, 터벅.
A large woman, radiating strength despite the strong smell of alcohol emanating from her, was approaching.
“Excuse me, what’s going on…?”
Her powerful aura subdued the explorers, and only the boy timidly inquired about her intentions.
The woman’s lips parted. “Boy, I was listening to your story from over there.”
“...Is that so?”
“Is it true? That Bjorn Yandel is alive? And that he is Lihen Shwietz?”
Her gaze and voice seemed to be filled with a desperate plea.
The boy, now slightly suspicious, answered diligently. “…Yes, yes! It’s true!” 
“Really… I see… So it was, then…”
The woman muttered to herself as if entranced, then pulled out a sum of money from her pocket and handed it to the boy before leaving the tavern.
The boy’s eyes widened as he checked the amount. “10,000 stones…?”
The tavern was abuzz.
“Paying that much for a story?”
“…I didn’t know this cheap tavern had someone that rich.”
“Who was that…?”
“Hey, why have you been quiet this whole time?”
Just as everyone was trying to figure out who the woman was, a man muttered quietly.
“Crazy…”
“Do you know who she is?”
“How many blonde female barbarians are there, anyway? And how many of them carry such a massive greatsword on their back?”
“I mean, who is she?” 
“The Storm Sword, Ainar Pnellin.”
As the man uttered her name, everyone’s eyes widened again.
“What, the woman from just now is one of the Seven Strong?”
“No, but… the Storm Sword, wasn't she Bjorn Yandel’s former comrade?”
“So… that’s why she was so interested…?”
“Now it makes sense!”
“What, does that mean even her former comrades didn’t know Bjorn Yandel was alive?” 
The tavern erupted once more. The patrons shared their thoughts, weaving new stories around the latest revelation. Only the innkeeper seemed troubled.
“That woman… she just walked out without paying for her drink…”
***
The whirlwind of the celebratory feast had ended, and we each returned to our own homes. I was worried that the Duke might try to keep us, but he didn't seem willing to go that far.
‘So far, so good…’
Our mansion, returning to its usual state after a long absence. I headed to my room on the second floor, unpacking my things while replaying yesterday’s feast in my mind.
‘At least he acknowledged it without any fuss.’
After I came out as Bjorn Yandel, without his consent, in front of thousands of nobles, the Duke seamlessly carried on with the event and managed the situation.
He confirmed that my death was a cover-up, all for carrying out a secret royal mission.
He even confirmed that the proclamation that I was an evil spirit was false.
He brought forward the original announcement, which was scheduled for two months later, when the documentation was ready, and made it public in front of everyone. 
He had no choice.
‘If he denied my words in that situation, the royal family’s reputation would be ruined.’
That’s precisely what I was aiming for.
What good is a grand celebratory feast, anyway?
It would be the talk of the town for a month or so, before fading into oblivion. To make a lasting impression and capture people’s attention, this was the best option.
For whatever reason, the royal family cares a lot about public opinion.
‘Good, for the next few months, at least, they won’t be able to use tricks like framing me for crimes I didn’t commit…’
Whatever anyone says, we made a good start.
The next step is to expand our influence as much as possible within the allotted time. If the events in the Labyrinth ever came to light, the first thing that should come to mind would be that eliminating us is a bad move.
‘A lot to do…’.
With that thought, I finished changing and headed downstairs. The living room was a mess.
“…Emily, what is going on?”
“We had an intruder while we were out.”
“…What?”
“The strands of hair I’d placed on the doorknobs for security were gone. Just in case, we searched everywhere except your room, but thankfully, we couldn't find any listening devices.”
“Wait, if there was an intruder, shouldn’t we check the recording crystals first?” 
Our house is equipped with CCTV—installed by Erwen—in the living room and at the front door. 
But…
“Ah, I already broke them. They only store recordings for a day anyway, and manipulating them is not that hard. Maybe they’ve already tampered with the magic circuits. We can't just leave them there.”
“…I see.”
“Whoever it was, they were pretty incompetent. They managed to break into an empty house, but didn’t even touch the basement.”
“The basement…? Oh, the navigator!”
I suddenly remembered someone I’d been neglecting.
Auyen Lokrobe, the navigator we’d acquired during our recent Labyrinth exploration, a former raider.
‘Amelia said she gave him enough food for the time he stayed with us…’
Several days have passed since the Labyrinth closed.
Could it be that he’s been starving this whole time?
“Is he alright?”
“He’s fine. He’s a bit thin, but I like the lean type.” 
No, I don’t think that’s the issue…
“Besides, his obedience has involuntarily increased. This incident exposed the fact that he’s lying about the antidote he needs to take daily, but it made him more dependent on us.”
“Uh…,”
“Do you want to go see him? He’s been asking for compliments, saying he stayed quiet and held his breath when he heard noises from above.”
“Ah, no… I’m good…”
“Well, you should show him some attention. You can’t leave everything to me.”
“…Later.”
Regardless, if he’s fine, I decided to put Auyen out of my mind. Then Amelia went to my room to continue searching, and after that, we all gathered in the living room.
“Is the house safe now?”
“For today, at least.”
“Ah… I feel like everything was a dream now that I’m back home.”
Erwen slumped onto the sofa, finally relaxing.
“Yandel, now that the house is safe, can we finally open it?”
“Ah, the subspace,” 
“Yeah…,”
Amelia’s eyes were like those of a child waiting for a Christmas present.
Well, I guess I’m no different.
What treasures might be hidden in the subspace belonging to the Rose Knights?
“Alright, let’s open it together when we count to three.”
I silently counted.
We reached two when…
똑똑.
Someone was at the door. 
I decided to put the subspace on hold and see who it was. The moment I heard the knock, I tensed up, but thankfully, I recognized the visitor.
“Raven.” 
“I’m sorry to bother you. I couldn’t just stay quiet after hearing the news.”
“Come in.”
Raven entered the living room and settled on the sofa, bombarding me with questions.
Was regaining my status something I had planned?
What did I think would happen in the future?
And…
“I’m so glad you’re safe, truly…”
Then the topic of the expedition came up. 
“How is… Mr. Yandel?”
“How’s he what?” 
“Many died… I was in the Palace of Glory on the day of the celebratory feast… I saw you apologize to the bereaved families, and I saw you call out each of their names…”
“…You did?”
“I was worried about him. Mr. Yandel… is he okay?” 
Is he okay? What am I supposed to say?
I hesitated for a moment before bursting into laughter and lightly patting Raven’s slender shoulders. 
“Why wouldn’t he be okay? We came back alive, didn’t we?”
“…What happened there?”
Only ten people survived that expedition.
It’s impossible to explain what happened in just a few words.
But…
“Nothing. It's just as the Duke said.”
It's better not to tell Raven.
She’s already burdened with guilt for helping me regain my identity despite being part of the military.
And this time, she’s not even involved. 
I can't burden her with fighting the royal family. 
That’s our burden alone.
“Somehow, Mr. Yandel seems distant today. Actually, he’s always been like that…,” 
“It’s just your imagination.” 
“Right, that must be it.” 
The air grew a bit awkward.
Raven, without speaking, took a sip of tea and stood up.
Or, rather, she tried to stand up.
쾅쾅쾅!
The sound of a heavy bang came from the front door.
What the hell? Is it a robber?
Just as I stood up to investigate…
“Bjoooorrnn!”
I recognized that voice immediately.
“Bjorn! Come out here! Are you really alive?!”
It was my comrades, arriving as promised. 
It was pure magic.
“Bjoooorrnn!” 
The moment I heard that voice, the corners of my lips couldn't help but turn up. 
A grin.
Yes, I've gotten my name back.
We’ve been apart for long enough.
So…
‘Just Misha and Bear Uncle left?’
It's time for us to reunite.
***
덜그럭, 덜그럭. 
Only the sound of silverware clinking echoed across the dining table.
“Hey, Nyaong,” Baekho said, his voice barely audible.
“…I told you not to call me that.”
“You don’t want me to use your title, and you don’t want me to use your name, so what am I supposed to call you?”
“Can’t you understand? Just don’t call me anything.”
“Geez, you’re so heartless…,” Baekho muttered as he glanced around. 
It was a normal mealtime, yet everyone was watching him nervously, picking at their food.
Except one person.
“Nyaong,”
“…….”
“You never go outside, do you?”
“…….”
“You’re not a real cat, you know. Except for when you’re going into the Labyrinth, you never go outside. Look, you’re so pale—,”
탁-!
The Red Cat woman slammed her chopsticks onto the table.
And then…
“I’m done,”
She cleared her own plate and headed to her room on the second floor.
덜컥.
As the sound of her door closing faintly reached Baekho, he let out a long sigh. 
He looked at the others around the table and asked for their opinions.
“She… still doesn't know, does she?”
The Doom Scholar answered first.
“We can’t keep it a secret forever.”
“Yeah, I know. But until then, everyone, be careful what you say, okay?”
The Pathfinder nodded.
“…Alright, I will.”
“Okay, that's all for dinner today. Everyone, go do your own thing.”
Baekho smiled and stood up, leaving his plate on the table.
Then…
덜컥.
The moment he returned to his room,
“…….”
His expression, which he had kept composed in front of his comrades, hardened.
It was inevitable. 
“Bjorn Yandel is alive…,”
He had no bad feelings toward Bjorn Yandel, actually.
After all, they’re both evil spirits.
He felt like he was looking at a promising junior.
Seeing him brought back old memories.
That’s why he took in Misha, a drenched cat. He was fascinated by her dedication to her lover, even after knowing she was an evil spirit.
He was genuinely sad to see the two of them separated.
But…
“Interesting.” 
It’s too late, way too late.
He couldn't just be happy about his return.
After all, if this kept up, the Icebound Swordsman he had diligently trained for two years might end up with the wrong person.
Well, technically, it would be closer to the rightful owner…
“He should have returned sooner. It’s a nuisance to show up now.”
Baekho pondered seriously.
“Maybe… I should just kill him?”
Eliminating anyone who stood in his way, without letting his emotions interfere.
It was Baekho’s long-standing principle.
