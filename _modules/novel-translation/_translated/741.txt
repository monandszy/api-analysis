The Shifting Sands of Fate (Part 4)
I stood before the gate.  A low, resonant *kuung-* echoed, then again. This gate, the sole passage between the Holy City and Sector 7, vibrated with the rhythmic thudding of thousands of barbarian feet.  Each warrior held their weapon, the ground trembling in unison.  *Kuung-*.
Admittedly, a strange excitement coursed through me. The reality of impending battle hit hard.  Or was it just nerves?  *Duk-un-!*  (A heartbeat)  I double-checked my equipment: the crossbow for that decisive shot, the daggers and longsword for close combat, the round shield for ranged defense or protecting important figures.  I checked the powder pouches for my arrows, the smoke bombs for distraction, potions, scrolls… *Kuung-*.  I even went through the supplies in my [Treasure Chest], but everything was in perfect order, a testament to my diligent maintenance.
“Hoo…,” I exhaled deeply, easing some of the tension. I loosened my muscles, preparing my body.
‘Did I… gain some weight?’ The equipment felt a little tight, an uncomfortable tightness from disuse, not from unfamiliarity. It was as if I’d finally slipped back into my own skin.
‘I thought I’d never wear these again.’  Perhaps I subconsciously knew this day would come, which is why I’d kept the equipment instead of selling it when money was tight.  This day.
*Kuung-*.  As I instinctively scanned my surroundings, I finally noticed the expressions on the other warriors’ faces—grim, resolute, and filled with a palpable gravity. I found their expressions unexpectedly intense. It wouldn't have surprised me from seasoned explorers, but…
*Kuung-*. They were stomping their feet in time, like a festival, yet I could sense the familiar tremor of battle anxiety beneath their bravado.
‘Of course…'
They were human.  A wound from a blade would draw blood, too much blood, and they knew they might never see their loved ones again—
"The gate opens soon!! Prepare for battle!!!!!!!!!!"
Einar, at the forefront, bellowed a command that echoed for a kilometer.  The barbarians, who had been anticipating this moment, roared their battle cry.
"Behel—raaaaaaaaaaaah!"
The roar was deafening, threatening to rupture my eardrums. I couldn't cover my ears; both hands gripped my weapons as I stared ahead.  At the very front stood the elite, hand-picked by Bersil Goul Land. Their equipment gleamed, their very aura exuded an exceptional power.
*Kwaak-* (A sound of tightening muscles)
Looking at Einar, I unconsciously tightened my grip on my weapons. Einar, standing guard before the gate, held a massive green halberd—a trophy from a past expedition.  Her back seemed stronger than anyone else's.  I thought: *Ah, so that's it*.  Those people are Bjorn Yandel’s ‘companions.’
*Kwaak*. There was no need for self-loathing. No reason to feel inadequate compared to their talent. When was it ever different? I was always slow, always lagging behind.  People called me diligent, but that diligence wasn't a choice; it was ingrained. Accepting this, I abandoned my life in the labyrinth and found a new profession. Therefore, dwelling on what could have been if I’d stayed was pointless. They’d continued to progress, while I fell behind, which is why they stood where they did. And most importantly…
*Kuung-*.  My presence here was for a different reason. Yes, that's it.
*Kwaak*.  I didn't need to feel inferior.
*Duk-un-*. (A heartbeat) I ignored the warnings of my intuition.
"The barrier is down!"
I took up arms to fight today.
"Behel—raaaaaaaaaaaah!"
Like these barbarians chanting their ancestral god's name before battle, I fought to protect something precious.

What to do? What to do? What to do?
That was the only thought occupying Sven Parav’s mind.  ‘What to do…?’ He endlessly questioned himself, seeking an answer.
"What? Did you hear? We have to save them!"
To save or not to save?  Surprisingly, Sven wasn't actually seeking an answer; the answer was already decided.
*Duk-un-*. (A heartbeat) He shouldn't save them. Leaving the wardrobe to save the woman outside would undoubtedly lead to misfortune.  That intense feeling weighed heavily on him.  He knew he might appear cowardly, despicable, even—
‘What to do?’ How could he convince Lilys Marone to leave them to their fate? He racked his brain, but the golden opportunity slipped away.
“…We risk being discovered.”
That was all he could manage.  Lilys Marone paused.
“…Disappointing. I didn’t know you were this kind of person.”
Her voice trembled with betrayal; her gaze was icy.  Sven felt as if someone was repeatedly stabbing his heart with a needle.
“…Lilys Marone is far more important to me than some nameless strangers.”
The truth, blurted out involuntarily under the pressure.  Slightly flustered, Sven quickly added more excuses.
"Besides, we need to survive to achieve our goal…."
It was an excuse, but a sincere one nonetheless.  Marone's response remained frigid.
"If finding a cause justifies abandoning someone’s life, what makes us different from the royals?"
“…….”
"Mr. Parav, stay in the wardrobe.  I'll save them, even if I'm alone."
With that, Marone went to the window. After a moment of concentration, she chanted,
"Naria Cartetura!"
The spell shot out, piercing the shattered window and striking the ground below.
“……Kyaaak!”
Only a woman's scream echoed from below; no other sounds followed.  Lilys Marone, a former military mage, was precise and swift, her magic instantly penetrating the skulls of two people.
“…….”
Sven Parav and Lilys Marone's eyes met across the shattered windowpane. Parav was speechless, but Marone wasn't.
“…Don’t worry.  I won’t trouble Mr. Parav any further.”
"Yes…? What do you—?"
Before he could ask, Lilys Marone leaped through the broken window to the ground below.
"Madam, please stay inside! I'll take care of these bodies…!"
“…Yes! Yes? Oh! I, I’ll help too!”
"I'll hold this end, please lift your leg!"
Feeling shame despite the bustling conversation below, Sven Parav slammed the wardrobe door shut.
***
The battle began abruptly.  *Hu-uuu-ung-!* The translucent barrier, soaring high above the walls, shimmered, then vanished completely.
“…….”
“…….”
Silence followed for about five seconds—an eerie, unprecedented silence.
*Duk-un-duk-un*.  Blood rushed to my head, narrowing my vision; my heart pounded sickeningly.  Simultaneously,
Why aren’t they coming? Was the barrier's release a mere coincidence?  Maybe… I don't have to fight?  That hope flickered in my mind, only to be shattered by—
*Kwaaaaaaaaaaaang-!*
A magical cannonball ripped through the gate.  Fortunately, protective spells cast by the mages minimized the collateral damage, but…
*Swaaaaaaaaa-!*
The cloud of dust couldn't hide the approaching army.
"They're coming…!"
The sound of hundreds, thousands of soldiers charging grew closer.
"Behel—raaaaaaaaaaaah!"
This ‘war’ was nothing like I’d imagined.  I’d assumed the elite would hold the line, but thousands of soldiers overwhelmed them.  They managed to stem the main flow, but smaller streams seeped through.
"Aaah!"
"Kill! Kill them all!!"
In an instant, the front line broke, and those smaller streams reached the second defense line.
"Kuaaaak!"
"Aaah!"
The eerie silence was a cruel deception; the area before the walls was now a cacophony of screams and the stench of blood.  It was a chaotic free-for-all—a battle where strategy and troop deployment were meaningless. And it was unfolding right before my eyes.
*Hu-ung-!*
I momentarily went blank, but the sting of an arrow grazing my ear snapped me back to reality.  I fought like a madman, swinging my weapons.
*Seogok-!*  (The sound of a blade cutting flesh) I cleaved an enemy with my longsword.
*Pisu-ung-!* (The sound of an arrow piercing something) I shot my crossbow, piercing an enemy's skull.
*Peo-eo-eong-!* (The sound of an explosion) I hurled powder pouches into the enemy ranks, and threw myself on the ground to protect an ally.  I did everything I could. And so did everyone else.
"Einar Fnellin!"
"Two-tier essence for whoever takes her head!"
"Dieeee!"
Einar, wielding her green halberd, demonstrated the meaning of ‘a force unto herself,’ showing overwhelming prowess.
*Kwaaaaaaaaaaaang-!*
Hyoeryeonghoo, Erwen Pornach Di Tersia… Even without their fame, each clan fought with the practiced teamwork of years. And the barbarian warriors showed no retreat.
"Behel—raaaaaaaaaaaah!!"
"Kill every invader who enters the Holy City!!"
It seemed impossible to hold back the Noark army. But that hope was short-lived.
*Peo-eo-eong-!*
"Magical cannon! Magical cannon!"
The Noark forces, having already taken the walls, unleashed their magical cannons below.
*Peo-eo-eo-eong-! Peo-eong-! Peo-eong-!*
Each blast decimated ranks, killing anywhere from a few to more than a dozen soldiers.
*Piiiiiiiii-!* (High-pitched ringing in the ears)
Human lives… were so easily extinguished. I felt as though the war was swallowing my very soul.
"Haah… haah…"
Less than ten minutes into the battle, my breath came in ragged gasps; my arms and legs felt weak.  Perhaps the deafening noise damaged my eardrums; all I heard was a relentless ringing.
“……!”
The screams of the dying soldiers were silent.
“………!!”
The shouts of the attacking enemies were also silent.  Only two sounds remained for me.
*Piiiiiiiiii-!* The relentless ringing that prevented rational thought.
And…
*Duk-un-!* The thrumming of a heart clinging to life.
“……!!”
“…………!!”
Amidst the silent malice and screams, I swung my weapons.
*Duk-un-!*  I desperately ignored the inexplicable foreboding.
