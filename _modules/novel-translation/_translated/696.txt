## The Last Stand of a Barbarian
“Well, I guess we’ve somehow become connected,” he said.
“Ah… is that so?” The GM and the Old Man exchanged pleasantries with smiles and chuckles, creating a warm atmosphere. Baekho, watching them with a disapproving gaze, muttered under his breath.
“That traitorous bastard… hasn’t he got any conscience at all?”
Honestly, I felt the same. How could they be so nonchalant about this situation? If it weren't for this old geezer, none of this would have happened—
“Hm, I prefer to call him a perceptive fellow.”
“...What?” “This rational, young friend… he’s got manners, right?”
The Old Man, Ruingenesis, seemed to be defending the GM with those words. Perhaps he was a popular figure amongst the older crowd? I don’t know. But even the Old Man was no different from the GM in front of Auris Gavis.
“It’s been a while, Master.”
“Ah, Ruingenesis… It's good to see you. How have you been?”
“What’s there to be or not be, Master?”
“I’ll take that as a good sign then.”
“Well, Master, you’re as unchanged as ever. It seems I alone have aged, while time has passed you by.”
“Ha-ha, you’re still young.”
It seemed like a chance for some lighthearted small talk, but it didn’t last long.
“Since we've met again after all this time, may I ask one question?”
“Go ahead.”
The Old Man wasted no time in firing off his question.
“Master, have you already attained immortality?”
“Ha-ha, you start with such a difficult question.”
“If it’s inconvenient, you don’t have to answer—”
“I'll answer one thing, though.”
Auris Gavis cut him off, his words like advice to a child.
“Eternity exists nowhere in any world, Ruingenesis.”
“...…”
“Everything changes eventually. Even if you thought it was immutable.”
“...A very philosophical answer.”
The Old Man nodded as if genuinely impressed by the answer, although it was clearly a compliment. Baekho, however, simply snorted.
“Philosophy?  In other words, if you keep hitting it, it’ll eventually die, right?”
“You seem particularly grumpy today.”
“Well, wouldn’t I be? It's quite obvious that you’re the one who put us in this situation.”
Baekho, unwilling to continue the small talk, moved straight to the point.
“I should be grateful you haven’t attacked me yet. You should be, I mean.”
As always, he was using strong wording to start a showdown, but unfortunately, his opponent was no pushover.
“Ha-ha, you’re the one who should be grateful.”
“Ha! Grateful?”
Auris Gavis stared at Baekho, who let out a sigh as if the statement was utterly ridiculous.  
“Then you should be grateful.”
“...…”
“For the fact that I haven’t found a reason to ‘dispose’ of you yet.”
The moment those words left his mouth, I could feel the air change.
“...…”
The air, once pleasant, was now prickly with the sensation of steel spikes.  Auris Gavis, who had already overwhelmed everyone with his presence, took a step forward.
“Baekho, still don’t you get it? I’ve been obstructing you to ‘dispose’ of you.”
His words were far more direct and threatening than Baekho’s threats.
“But if you keep acting out like this, I might have to ‘reconsider.’”
I could see Baekho was slightly intimidated. After all, even with all his bravado, he had to acknowledge that he was no match for this old man.
“...So what exactly do you want? What about Briet? It seems you’ve been keeping him close by for a long time.”
“Briet was a guide for you.”
“What? A guide…?”
“You’re a person of interest. So you need someone to watch over you, to guide you on the right path so you don’t go astray.”
His brazen words were utterly absurd, even to someone like me listening from the side. But that’s how it is in this world.
“...…”
In a world of savagery, the voiceless are the powerless. Baekho, having enjoyed the privileges of the powerful for so long, was left speechless by this attitude.
“Just say it.”
Baekho finally spoke, his voice tinged with resignation after a long silence.
“What do you want from me…  Just say it.”
The emotion I felt in his short question was not anger. It was exhaustion. Baekho, this bastard… how tired and worn out he must have been after all this time.
“Hm, I don’t really want anything from you.”
“...What?”
“Don’t you know yet? That you’re a defective product.”
Auris Gavis spoke slowly and clearly, his gaze locked on Baekho.
“I never wanted you. I never wanted you to come here. So I don’t understand why you hate me. You’re on the wrong track, don’t you think?”
“...…”
“Well, if I really wanted anything, it’s just this: know your place and keep quiet.”
“...…”
“Play your role as a side character. Don’t try to change the story.”
Baekho remained silent, unable to respond to Auris Gavis’s sharp words. But his eyes, filled with anger, spoke volumes. How much humiliation he must have been enduring right now.  The Old Man, Ruingenesis, with his zero empathy, seemed unfazed by it all.
“If Baekho is a side character, then that means we’re also side characters, right?”
The Old Man’s eyes lit up, interested only in the part that concerned him.
“Are you upset about that?”
The Old Man shook his head in response to Auris Gavis’s question.
“Not really. I’m past the age of thinking I’m the protagonist, and…”
“And?”
“What’s the point of being the protagonist in someone else’s story?”
“...A very intriguing statement.”
Auris Gavis looked at the Old Man with a suspicious gaze, but the Old Man remained expressionless, moving on to the next topic.
“You know Flyer and Aures, right?”
“Hm…”
“I don’t think there’s much connection between the two of you, so I asked.”
Auris Gavis glanced between Jeina and Rex Aures, as if deep in thought.  Then...
“I met her once.”
Jeina was the first to admit that she had a connection with the old man.
“She told me that you could recover lost memories by offering sacrifices to Karui. It was this person.”
“...I see. What about Aures?”
“Uh… uh… I… I met him several times after the day the royal family invaded the city of Noark. Starting from that day, I’ve seen him beside the Lord many times.”
His tone clearly suggested he was lying.  Baekho and the Old Man both narrowed their eyes. Auris Gavis shook his head.
“Aures is from the same world as Ruingenesis.”
“...What?” “No way! This guy was also an Evil Spirit…?”
From what I could tell, no one in our group had known this information… 
‘All six of us are Evil Spirits together… this is like an Evil Spirit Dream Team.’ 
It was truly ironic. I still remember being surprised when I found out that half of our group were Evil Spirits.  But it wasn't half, it was all of us.
“Uh… maybe Briet too…?”
Jeina trailed off, looking at Auris Gavis.  She must have thought the same thing I did…
“Briet was born and raised in this world. He’s a pureblooded resident.”
So six out of seven of us were Evil Spirits. It felt strange. In any group, Evil Spirits were always a small minority.
The Ghostbusters, unique because they were the only group where that wasn’t the case, were special for this very reason.
“What kind of stupid expression is ‘pureblooded resident’?”
Baekho grumbled, unhappy with the specific wording, but Auris Gavis didn’t even bother to answer.
“Oh, I never thought Aures would be from the same place as I. Why didn’t you say so earlier?”
“Ah, ha-ha… I didn’t mean to deceive anyone. Honestly, I didn’t even know myself until now that we were from the same place.”
“Well, it wasn’t something to bring up first, but… there’s a lot to talk about with you. I have many questions about your world.”
“Ha-ha-ha… Ask anything you want. To be honest, my memories are hazy, but I’ll tell you anything that comes to mind.”
I had a feeling that Aures and the Old Man would sit together and chat about their shared past whenever they had free time…
‘I can’t even imagine it….’
Just as I was trying to process the fact that Aures was an Evil Spirit, the GM approached Auris Gavis with a timid expression.
“Uh, sir?  Do you know where we are…?”
“Are you curious if we’re inside or outside the walls? Or maybe somewhere else entirely?”
“Yes… Well, it seems that the Baron and I were caught up in this situation while taking a stroll outside…”
“Well… from your perspective, that may be true.”
“...Yes?”
The GM tilted her head at the vaguely meaningful words, but Auris Gavis didn’t explain further. He simply returned to the previous question.
“This place is somewhere outside the walls. It holds a deep meaning for me.”
“Ah… is that so…?”
“So I can’t tell you exactly where we are. Please understand.”
“Yes? Then—”
“Don’t worry. It doesn’t mean I’m going to keep you here.”
“Ha-ha, is that so? Then I’m truly relieved. I had no intention of embarking on such a long journey…”
The GM continued to flatter the culprit who had created this entire situation.  Well, at least the presence of someone willing to play that role had helped things move smoothly.
“Not going to keep us? So you’re just going to let us go?”
Baekho, who had been listening intently with a sullen expression, abruptly asked the question. Auris Gavis nodded slowly.
“Of course. If you promise me just one thing.”
“...Say it.”
“I didn’t plan to be this blunt, but since things have turned out this way, I’ll just come clean.”
“No, just get on with it already.”
“Don’t seek answers elsewhere.”
Baekho flinched at Auris Gavis’s words before letting out an awkward laugh.
“What kind of absurd statement is that? You ask for a promise, but you have to be more specific.”
“Then I’ll be more direct.”
“...…”
“Baekho, I know why you’re aiming for the royal palace.”
“And…?”
“But don’t even think about going there. You won’t find the answers you’re looking for there.”
Auris Gavis didn’t mention any penalties for breaking the promise.
He’d already said it several times before. If Baekho disobeyed, he would be ‘disposed’ of. Baekho knew it, and so did I.
“...Then where exactly are those answers?”
Baekho asked only one additional question, and Auris Gavis smiled kindly as he replied.
“Aren’t you ‘explorers’?”
He patted Baekho on the shoulder.
“Seek your answers in the Labyrinth.”
As if he had no ill intentions whatsoever.
“All the answers you seek are there.”
Looking at Auris Gavis speaking in that gentle voice, I couldn’t help but think of Karui.  Come to think of it, this old man is similar to Karui. In that he always toys with people.
Auris Gavis waited patiently for Baekho’s response, without any prompting.
“...…”
“...…”
A comfortable yet heavy pressure. It didn’t take long for Baekho to raise the white flag.
“Oh, okay, okay. I get it.  You’re saying don’t touch the royal palace, right? I won’t.  So we’re good, right?”
If you’re going to raise the white flag, you can at least be a bit more respectful.
‘Well… is he expecting something?’
As I thought that to myself, Baekho continued in a smug tone.
“But you’re not all-powerful either, are you? Running around like this, cleaning up your messes.”
“...?”
“I mean, it’s obvious, right? It seems like you’re not happy with the Labyrinth being closed either.  Wasn’t this all because you saved Noark from extinction?”
“So what are you trying to say?”
“Well, nothing in particular…  I’m just saying.  It’s not like I haven’t seen you run around before. But this time, you’ve revealed yourself, so it must mean you’re in a tight spot.”
In other words, he was fishing for a reaction to confirm his suspicions.
“Well, it seems like I was right, judging by your reaction.”
