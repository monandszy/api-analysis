##  The Closed Gate (2)
We were scouring the empty village.  Or perhaps, "plundering" would be a more fitting word.  The sole order given by the village chief, who had taken over the body of the former commander, was concise: "Gather all the things you find within the village."  Furniture, fixtures, equipment, everyday tools - every single item, regardless of its apparent usefulness, was to be collected.  It was a clear directive to take everything.
So why would the chief issue such an order?  Surely, it couldn’t be out of sentimentality for the things accumulated over the years, for he wasn’t the type to cling to possessions.  The only explanation was that he simply mimicked the actions of Jerome Saintred.  The man would have pilfered everything in the village, claiming it was for the royal family.  Thus, the chief followed suit.
“The leaders of each group should take these maps and be assigned their designated areas…!”
With that, the expeditionary force, divided into groups, commenced their work - plundering the homes of the monsters who had once believed themselves to be human, raised children, and lived within this very village.  A tedious task devoid of combat. 
There were some, however, who welcomed this mundane activity.
“These objects, imbued with the remnants of the first beastly creatures who could communicate!”
“They’ll be invaluable research material!”
“It’s a shame, though… if we could capture one or two alive, we could hear their stories directly.”
“Any chance of any hidden creatures lurking nearby?”
The mages, consumed by their insatiable thirst for knowledge,  saw immense value in this task.  Raven, of course, was no exception.
“You said you stayed here, didn’t you, Yandell?”
“And?”
“Could I, perhaps, hear about it in detail sometime? If you have the time.”
“Of course, when I have the chance.”
“A promise? Okay, I’ll head out.  My break is over.  See you later.”
As for us, the makeshift fourth squad, we diligently searched and re-searched our assigned area.  A strange sensation lingered, however. 
“This, this is the mansion where we stayed!”
“Ah! And there’s the open space where we practiced with Piarochichi!”
“It’s spooky. Even the forge has its flames burning, but there’s no one inside.”
“Something... it’s hard to describe, but there’s something… incredibly strange about this place.  They were monsters, sure, but there were also some really good ones.”
What truly separated humans from monsters?  Was it appearance?  Racial characteristics?  The presence of experience points?
Then again, was the village chief, who had regained his human body, really human?  Conversely, what if I were to become monstrous through some event, or perhaps inhabit one of their bodies?  Would that make me a monster?
I no longer knew the answer.  Not even whether there was any meaning in drawing such a distinction. 
“Yandell… are you alright?  You look upset.”
“Of course I’m alright.  Why wouldn’t I be?”
“If you say so.”
We continued with our assigned tasks, and once the search of our area was complete, we rejoined the other groups at the village center.  By now, it was time to set up camp.
“The amount is staggering…”
“It’s no surprise. This was a village where hundreds of creatures lived.”
The daylong task of scouring and plundering the village was finally over.  We had searched every nook and cranny, but found no survivors.  The day’s work concluded, we set up camp in a suitable empty dwelling, each squad in their own assigned space.  Finally, we had time for a quiet conversation with our comrades.
“We’ll be… in the other room.  Over there.”
“Yes, have a comfortable conversation.”
Armin’s expeditionary force and the Hextz clan politely excused themselves.  Once Bersill activated the “voice-control” spell, Amelia promptly began to speak.
“So, what really happened?”
“Oh, that…”
“Don’t think for a moment that you conspired with the commander.  If you had, with your personality, you wouldn’t have kept me in the dark.”
Especially without giving me a moment to speak. 
‘…She isn’t entirely wrong.’
It could have been incredibly dangerous.  The goddess told me that my comrades were subdued through a surprise attack at the same moment I collapsed.  The biggest problem was the lack of anyone to give orders.
What do I do?  Should I fight back?  But this is the royal family’s army.  What would I do if I were in their shoes? 
In that split second of judgment, Clan Anabad, without me, couldn’t make a timely decision, leading to their entire force being subdued.
‘…Luckily, the result itself was positive.’
That good result wasn’t because of wise judgment, but simply because things turned out well.  If we had stubbornly resisted, someone would have died or been severely injured.  That’s why she doesn’t believe me.  I wouldn’t have kept them in the dark, banking on luck.
“Like you said, there was no hidden cooperation.  In fact, Jerome Saintred tried to hand me over to the village chief.”
That part is an undeniable truth.
“Seems he attempted to bribe the chief with the royal family’s treasure.  But I managed to resolve the situation, and even used it to turn the tables on the chief.”
“…What do you mean, ‘managed to resolve the situation’?”
Bersill seemed unconvinced, so I sighed inwardly and said,
“Leatlas helped me a lot.”
This is also true.
Well, it was more like her advice to resolve things peacefully.  But she did contribute significantly to getting me out of that situation.
“Leatlas…?”
“Could it be that when that light burst out and you collapsed…?”
“Anyway, I can’t talk about the details.  It’s a promise I made to the goddess.  But… things worked out in the end.  After escaping the village, I secretly made a deal with Jerome Saintred.  He’d forget about trying to use me as a scapegoat if we took care of the village chief first.”
“…So that’s why he was saying about the great feat and reward.”
I glanced around.  The mention of the goddess’s name, combined with the fact that the commander was offering me a reward, seemed to have convinced most of them.  Except for Amelia.
‘…She’s going to relentlessly question me when we’re alone later.’
Just thinking about it gave me a headache, but it was unavoidable.  The fewer people who knew about the village chief’s secret, the better.  Even if I played my role well, given that it was the village chief himself, he’d be able to sense that I shared his secrets.  If that happened, that person would also become a target of the village chief’s potential “rash actions.”
‘More importantly… if things really go wrong someday, it’ll be easier to prove that I have no involvement.’
Anyway, I answered a few more questions from my comrades, ending that topic for the time being.  It was time to move on to the next phase.
“Can everyone please step aside for a moment?”
“Oh… okay, you need some rest too… .”
“Misha, you stay.”
“…Eh?”
Misha looked as startled as a student called on by their teacher.  My comrades left, heading for their rest, and only Misha remained, sitting on a chair with her fists clenched on her knees.  She cautiously asked,
“What, what is it…? You just called me out… .”
I didn’t want to beat around the bush, so I went straight to the point.
“The resurrection stone.”
“!”
Just those three words, and her shoulders flinched.  I couldn’t believe she’d hidden it this long, but thinking about it, it was all my fault.  I should have pressed her harder, even if it meant pushing her a little.  For some reason, it was always difficult to do that with her.
“Did Baekho give it to you?”
She didn’t ask how I knew or offer a similar response.  My direct question earned a brief answer.  In a voice barely audible above a whisper.
“Yeah… .”
“What did he say when he gave it to you?”
“He said… to stay by your side… and if you ever die, to use it… to bring you back.”
Ah, so that’s how it was.  It wasn’t surprising, as I’d suspected it.  But I still had some questions.
“Did you know that the resurrection stone causes the target to lose all their memories?”
“…What?”
Okay, her expression confirmed she didn’t know about that particular aspect.  I moved on to my next question.
“If you didn’t know, why didn’t you tell me beforehand? It doesn’t seem like it would harm me, from what you’ve told me.”
“He said… that something bad would happen to you if you knew… .”
“So you hid it from me?  Because that bastard said so?”
“… .”
Misha lowered her head and clamped her lips shut.  As I watched her closely, a strange emotion surfaced.  It wasn’t anger, as my mind remained calm.  And it wasn’t tranquility, as my heart kept pounding.  It was far from sorrow.  What exactly was this feeling?
“Alright.  Go on.  Get some rest.”
I wanted to end the conversation because I couldn’t understand it.  It was a way of showing her consideration, to avoid making her feel any more uncomfortable.  But why, for some reason, did… 
“… .”
Misha remained seated, silent.  So I asked,
“Why aren’t you leaving?  Go rest.  I’ve heard everything I need to hear.”
Slowly, Misha raised her head.  With effort, she spoke.
“You… heard everything? That’s… it?”
It was an odd question for me.
“Why?  Do you need anything else?”
“… .”
“I had no intention of scolding you.  You didn’t act out of malice, you were just trying to help me.”
To my gentle response, Misha was silent again for a long time.  The silence stretched on for what felt like an eternity.
“That’s… .”
“…?”
“I… don’t like that… .”
Misha lowered her head, continuing to speak.
“Just… tell me.  Anything… .”
Her words, tinged with desperation, pleaded for a response.  Unconsciously, I found myself speaking.
“I just thought I didn’t need to talk any more.”
It was a strange experience.  I never realized that even my own true feelings could be spoken before I even consciously recognized them.
“It’s hard to believe anything you say, even after hearing all this today.”
Once, she was the one person I could trust in this strange world, more than anyone else.  But that wasn’t the case anymore.  Of course, it wasn’t entirely her fault.  If I were to assign blame, Baekho would be responsible for a much larger share.
“To be honest.”
“… .”
“After hearing your story today, the first thought that crossed my mind was that you were probably hiding something else.”
“…Yeah… .”
I was about to apologize, but then I decided it wasn’t something I needed to apologize for.  Misha looked at me for a while, then slowly stood up.  And… 
Thump, thump, thump.
Without a word, she walked away.
Thump.
The door closed, and she quietly left the room.
***
The next morning, after the daily morning meeting, I had a private audience with the village chief.
“Can’t we just get rid of the pointless morning meetings?”
“That’s impossible.  Jerome Saintred values routine.”
“Well, I understand that.”
“So, have you thought about the reward I mentioned?”
“Ah, about that… I’m going to put that off for now.  I don’t need anything right now.”
“Alright.  Just let me know anytime.”
“I will.  Anyway, the important thing is our plan going forward… what are you going to do now?”
“Like I said before, I’m going to gradually adapt to this body.  It will take time.”
The village chief’s answer remained unchanged.  However…
“Adaptation… .”
That statement ultimately meant he didn’t trust me.  He wanted to find out what kind of essence I possessed, whether I’d truly consumed the Iblis essence, and if the [Heathen Altar] was actually installed in the city.  He wanted to confirm all of that first. 
“And after you adapt?”
“I’ll leave this place immediately.”
In other words, once the Iblis essence is confirmed, he’ll immediately step aside.  It was a day I was eagerly anticipating.  Well, that and satisfying my curiosity.
“But if you’re going to keep living in that body, why don’t you just leave with the rest of us? The Iblis essence can’t be erased.”
Was this a gamer’s occupational hazard?  I couldn’t shake the feeling that it was so inefficient to leave early, losing those precious days.  More accurately, I was just frustrated at the thought of missing out.  I wasn’t the one at a loss in this situation.
“Plus, if you die and escape alone, the royal family won’t look kindly upon you. You might lose your position as a commander.”
“Ahahaha, how curious! I never thought you’d give me such advice.”
“We’re on the same boat for now, aren’t we?  We might need to cooperate even outside.  By the way, your laughter skills have improved.”
“I’m gradually adapting, you see.  To the human heart.”
“So, what’s your answer?”
“The same as before.  Once I’ve adapted, I’ll leave immediately.”
Why did the village chief insist on doing something so inefficient?  As I stared at him, filled with questions, he forced a smile and began to speak.
“You’ve been in this layer for just over a hundred days, haven’t you?”
“And?”
“You still know nothing about this layer.”
“…?”
“Of course, you’ll eventually leave this place as per the records…  But how long that will take, no one knows.”
He continued,
“I’ve been waiting…  for this moment for a very long time.”
This time, it wasn’t a forced emotion.  The village chief’s voice was filled with an intense emotion I’d never witnessed before.  Though the moment was fleeting.
“Ha, ha,  everyone values different things.  If I can leave this place even a single day sooner, then that’s enough for me.”
He then resumed his artificial smile, as if nothing had happened.
