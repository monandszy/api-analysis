The game's D version was too hard for me to beat. Now, they want me to do it in real life? Maybe I’ll have to live here forever. Even that wouldn’t be easy, though.
=========================================
Chapter 1: Prologue
I’d loved games since I was a kid. The reason was simple: I was confined to the hospital, and gaming was the only option. As time passed, games became an integral part of my life. But, as with anything, repetition eventually brought boredom.
“Damn… is this AI’s decision for real? Why’d it give her a heal?”
At some point, I started losing the enjoyment I’d once felt in gaming. It wasn’t a matter of genre: AOS, RPG, FPS – nothing made a difference. Every game released year after year felt like garbage. The stories and world-building were unoriginal, the mechanics lacked depth. I yearned for something unique, something special.
That’s when I discovered Dungeon & Stone.
The game was a single-player RPG, an indie title from overseas. It lacked Korean support, employing 2D pixel graphics, a rarity in this day and age. Honestly, it was far from my usual style. But, it was free, so I installed it, hoping to give it a shot. Before long, I was fully immersed.
“Wow, this priest almost got us all killed.”
It was an unusual game in many ways. If your character died, you had to start over from scratch. NPC companions were essential for progressing, and despite being a side-scrolling game, it offered incredible freedom. The skill system and world-building were captivating, and even though the story was in English, it was still intriguing. Most importantly, the game had an inexplicable charm.
At the time, I was a social service worker assigned to the subway, and I began to devote myself to Dungeon & Stone. It wasn't easy. Combat in this game wasn’t simply a matter of HP/MP. Even with full health, a single misjudgment could erase a character I’d spent months building.
“…Let’s do this.”
After more than two years, I still hadn’t progressed past the mid-game. With my pride swallowed, I searched for walkthroughs. Korean portals didn’t even have entries, so I had to read English translations, which were not much help. Even overseas, the user base was small, and related content was sparse and unhelpful. Compared to those who quit after a couple of months, calling it a terrible game, I had a much deeper understanding, having spent two years grappling with it.
I eventually stopped looking for walkthroughs.
“Three steps up, four steps left, one step down, two steps left, six steps up again, four steps right. Then dodge the trap… Okay.”
Wasn’t this the game I’d been desperately searching for? I decided to complete it alone, no matter how long it took. And then…
“Ugh.”
I finally reached this point.
「Gate of the Abyss」
My character stood before a portal leading to the final boss room. Of course, actually seeing the ending would require several more visits. This wasn’t a game you beat on the first try. Even so, I could feel my tense fingertips, a testament to my anxiety.
“The final boss…”
It might seem insignificant to some. But it had taken me nine years to get here. It wasn’t an exaggeration to say I’d spent my entire twenties with this game. I played it on the day my social service assignment ended, on the day I returned to school to re-enroll, on the day I received my acceptance letter for my dream job. I always played Dungeon & Stone.
「Do you wish to enter?」
As I moved my character closer to the portal, the question popped up. I clicked YES, naturally. But, perhaps because it was the final boss room, an extra message appeared, one with a sense of gravity.
「You may not be able to return.」
「Are you sure you wish to enter?」
It was unnecessary theatrics from a player’s perspective. As if I wouldn’t enter at this point?
「Yes / No」
I clicked Yes, and the screen transitioned to a loading screen. I focused my gaze on the black monitor, willing myself to concentrate. How many patterns did this boss have? What was its weakness? It would have a one-hit kill move for sure.  Forget about clearing on the first try, let’s gather as much information as possible. Maybe I’ll need to completely revamp my build and team.
My brain, stimulated by excitement and anticipation, was consumed only by thoughts of the final boss. As a result, I was slow to react.
「You have reached the abyss.」
「Tutorial complete.」
Tutorial complete?  But, more importantly, why is this in Korean? Wasn’t Dungeon & Stone only available in English?
「Starting transfer.」
Simultaneously with my sense of unease, a blinding light erupted. The source was so intense I couldn’t believe it was coming from my monitor.
“Damn it! My eyes!”
Everything instantly turned white. My ears rang, my skin felt an unknown heat. My consciousness faded rapidly, as if I’d been injected with anesthetic. My crisis management skills were usually top-notch, but at this moment, I had no idea what was happening.
Flash-!
Feeling the light intensify, I lost consciousness. And when I opened my eyes again…
I was a Barbarian in the game.
