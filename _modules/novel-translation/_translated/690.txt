## Chapter 690: Mystery (4)
Following Baekho's suggestion, we began our in-depth research on the armor we had acquired. 
Two high-ranking sorceresses, Baekho, a former gamer, and myself, along with two elite explorers from the local populace, gathered to examine the mysterious armor that had emerged from the mystery box.  Our combined expertise yielded swift results.
“It's definitely a Numbered Item,” declared the GM, her voice filled with certainty.
“A Numbered Item? I've never heard of such a thing,” I replied, genuinely confused.
“Me neither, but there’s no doubt about it.  The classification itself is based on whether it shows specific magical reactions,” Baekho chimed in.
“How is that even possible…?” I couldn’t shake the feeling of bewilderment.
“Actually, if you look at the history of the labyrinth, not all numbered artifacts have existed from the beginning. There was a time when there were no 'numbers' at all,” the GM explained.
“Oh! A time without numbers? Did such a time exist?” I questioned, intrigued.
“Yes. It was only after a certain Appraiser compiled 10,000 artifacts into a single book that 'numbers' were assigned,” she confirmed.
“Perhaps this armor is a new Numbered Item that no explorer has discovered since the labyrinth’s inception,” Baekho remarked with a glint in her eye.
“...A new Numbered Item?” I questioned, trying to understand the implications.
“I believe there are more cases like this armor. So, I'd like to name it 'No Numbers' or 'Mystery Numbers'—.” The GM was clearly eager to assign a unique name, but alas, someone had already claimed it.
“The official name is Secret Numbers,” I stated matter-of-factly.
“What...?  Who?” The GM looked perplexed.
“Arua Raven discovered it first and named it,” I explained.  “Naturally, she’d be upset if someone else took credit.”
“Oh… I see,” she muttered, her expression subdued. “Could it be… that there are more of these artifacts?” 
Despite the slight disappointment in her voice, she quickly shifted her focus, her curiosity outweighing any resentment.  
I pondered for a moment before answering honestly. “Yes, I’ve found one other such artifact in the labyrinth.”
“May we see it?” She asked, her eyes filled with anticipation.
“Unfortunately, I don't have it on me right now,” I replied, trying to maintain a casual tone.
“Oh… I see,” she sighed, her disappointment obvious.  
It was evident that everyone was curious about the other artifact, but I only revealed that I had acquired it during our exploration of the first floor.
“A 'Secret Number' from the first region opened,” the GM mused, a hint of excitement in her voice. “Perhaps there are many more undiscovered Numbered Items out there.”
“I agree,” I said, my thoughts mirroring her own. “The outer walls, and even the first floor we explored recently, are areas that explorers have rarely ventured into over the centuries.  These are the places that have been uncovered in the last few years.”
“Wow, it’s a bound item?” Baekho exclaimed, her eyes wide with surprise. 
This armor was already bound to me.
“B-Bound inscription?  So… I can’t get it back!” the GM cried, her voice filled with despair.
“So what?  What are you going to do about it?  What are you going to do about it?” I retorted, nonchalantly.  I simply ignored her outburst, picking at my nose as if I hadn’t heard a word.
“Alright then, explain it to me. You’re sure it's a bound item?” she demanded.
“Yes? Ah, yes. If someone else tries to wear it, shape adjustment won't work. Even if they force it on, it'll just become a regular, useless suit of armor. It’s a typical pattern for bound inscriptions,” I explained patiently.
“I think the ambiguous fluctuation we sensed last time might have been related to this owner inscription circuit,” Baekho added.
“Yes, that’s a strong possibility,” I agreed.
In addition to being bound, the armor also had a "Unbreakable" option.  It also had an option that directly affected the wearer’s stats:  “Increased Regeneration Speed.”  This was, in the GM's opinion, the most remarkable feature of the armor.
“That’s an incredibly rare trait. It’s not limited to specific resources like soul power, magical energy, or divine power, but applies to everything that regenerates,” she said, her voice filled with awe. 
She wasn’t talking about just resources used like MP. 
“Increased Regeneration Speed” also affected “Natural Regeneration” and, if I acquired skills that used unique resources, the trait would still be beneficial.
“Well, if it’s a Numbered Item, it needs a proper name, right?” Baekho said, reminding me of the obvious. We couldn't just keep calling it “armor.”
“Oh! I can come up with a cool name—.”
“Aegis Dragon Armor.”
“...What?”
“It’s the Aegis Dragon Armor. From now on, that's what we’ll call it.”
I declared my choice, and Baekho nodded in approval.
“Wow, that's a good name!  The color is great too, it looks like a set item.”
While Baekho was enthusiastic, Jayna, on the other hand, looked perplexed.
“I understand Aegis, but why Dragon Armor? It's not made of dragonhide, and it doesn't have a dragon heart in it,” she questioned, her voice filled with confusion.
“Uh…,” I stammered, caught off guard by her unexpected question.  
Truth be told, I responded honestly.
“It just feels a little boring to just call it armor,” I admitted.
“Ah, I see.”
Jayna still seemed puzzled, but the other male members of our party nodded in agreement.  It seemed that men generally prefer “Dragon Armor” over "armor” or "plate armor.”
“Oh, women don’t understand a man’s heart.”
At any rate, the name “Aegis Dragon Armor” was settled, and curiously, this process led to a new discovery.
“Quite a coincidence.  I tested a direct comparison with the ‘Aegis Wall,’ and there’s actually a resonance reaction.” 
“In simpler terms, it’s a set item with the real shield?”
“Yes.  The Aegis Dragon Armor and the Wall are both resonance artifacts.”
Resonance artifacts are set items that provide additional effects when worn together.
“For example, there’s No. 7611, ‘Necromancer’s Deception,’ which the Bearman used.”
“Wearing it simultaneously with a belt shaped like a skull called ‘Necromancer’s Pride’ (No. 7612), results in a resonance effect.  The effect is a 50% health recovery every time one of the artifacts’ abilities activates,” Baekho explained.
Anyway, as we discovered the resonance effect, the existing information about this artifact was updated.
“So what’s the resonance effect of the armor and shield?” Baekho asked, her curiosity growing.
“Hm… it seems like the regeneration effect is the resonance effect.”  
The "Increased Regeneration Speed" option was the resonance effect of the Aegis set.
“Oh, so it has separate passive effects?” 
“Yes. It seems to have one passive ability and one active ability,” I said.
In other words, the armor itself has one passive and one active option.
The active effect was easy to identify through various experiments.
* * *
[Yurben Habellion cast the 5th-grade attack magic [Thunderbolt].]
* * *
The effect was simple.
* * *
[Yurben Habellion cast the 4th-grade attack magic [Storm Rush].]
* * *
It was a defensive ability, as expected of an armor-based option.
* * *
[Yurben Habellion cast the 4th-grade attack magic [Ice Sword].]
* * *
As expected…
* * *
[The character used [Aegis Dragon Armor].]
* * *
After all, isn't it true that the best defense is a good offense? 
* * *
[Reflects accumulated damage.]
* * *
The Dragon Armor's active ability was similar to the essence of ‘gacha games’ in some ways.  A ‘counterattack’ mechanism, and…
* * *
[The character used [Aegis Dragon Armor].]
* * *
Similar to how one-time-use skeletons were summoned for counterattacks, a sort of summoner appeared behind me. 
These two features resemble ‘gacha games.’ 
But the crucial difference is…
“…Why is it so big?”
It was far more imposing than any skeleton.
“...Is it a summoning ability?” 
“Uh... but it’s moving!”
A colossal Viking warrior, formed of souls, brandished a greatsword.
It was aimed at the GM, who had been attacking me for the experiment.
“Shit!! Block it!”
Baekho's cry spurred the Destroyer to conjure a magical barrier to intercept the sword's path. 
* * *
[The character used [Aegis Dragon Armor].]
* * *
* * *
[Reflects accumulated damage.]
* * *
* * *
[The character used [Aegis Dragon Armor].]
* * *
Crack-!
The barrier, hastily constructed, wasn’t strong enough to withstand the greatsword.
“Come forth!”
In response, Rex Aures swiftly stepped forward, raising his shield.
* * *
[The character used [Aegis Dragon Armor].]
* * *
* * *
[Reflects accumulated damage.]
* * *
“Cough-!”
Rex Aures, blocking the greatsword with his colossal shield, vomited blood.  The situation was resolved.
Clang-!
Aures' gigantic shield, deeply dented, fell to the ground.  The soul giant, having fulfilled its purpose, vanished into thin air.
“Are, are you okay?”
Jeina, the healer, rushed to Rex Aures’ side to check on his condition, and only then did the GM realize she had just come close to death, collapsing to the ground.
“Wow… this is insane.”  Baekho observed, her eyes gleaming with excitement.
“It’s definitely triggered by taking damage, but does it reflect damage proportionally?  Or is it based on a fixed amount accumulated before it can be activated?”
“.....”
“Hm, depending on which it is, our approach will have to change a bit.  But it’s not a guaranteed hit, so it shouldn’t be too difficult.”
Ah, this is why I wanted to research this on my own later.
“Hey, hey! What are you all doing? No one’s hurt!  Stop freaking out and get back to the research.”
“Huh? Baekho? Did you not see? My mouth was bleeding—.”
“Well, it’s not bleeding anymore.”
“.....”
With Baekho’s encouragement, we resumed our research, delving into the active ability in detail.
“The longer you take damage, the more stacks accumulate, and the damage increases proportionally based on those stacks.”
“The cooldown is only 5 minutes, and there’s no specific resource consumption.  But even with only 4 stacks, it can deal enough damage to pierce through twenty magic barriers like they’re paper?”
“Ah, yeah, yeah.  It's unbreakable because it’s a Numbered Item.”
“But it’s a set item, so if you wear them together, the regeneration speed goes crazy, and there’s even another passive effect we haven’t figured out yet?”
Oh, uh…
Well, it feels like that’s the gist of it…
“Shit, what the hell is this overpowered armor?”
“.....”
I’m speechless.
I agree with her assessment.  
Even just considering the active ability alone, it’s comparable to a single Numbered Item. If the passive is as good as a single Numbered Item, then it’s safe to say we’ve basically acquired a new one.
“It’s, it’s mine… Originally…”
Listening to the GM’s mutterings, I felt pangs of guilt, but what could I do about it now? It’s not like I could just return it.
“Yurben Habellion, stop whining.”
“Bu, but…,” she whimpered.
“It’s inevitable. It’s not like I wanted to bind it to myself.”
“.....”
“Or are you assuming this is the end of our connection?  That we’ll only explore together once?”
“Th, that’s not what I meant…,” she stuttered.
“Then wouldn’t it be good for you if I get stronger?  I’m not the kind of person who forgets favors.”
My logical argument left the GM speechless, and she clamped her mouth shut. 
She seemed a bit downcast, but this is something time will take care of.
“Wow, Baron, you’re so good at gaslighting.”
I ignored Baekho’s comment and continued our equipment research.  Our priority was to thoroughly investigate the remaining passive abilities.
But…
Day, two days, three days… 
No matter how much time passed, we couldn’t unravel the Dragon Armor’s passive effects.
“Ah… if only we had some monsters, we could figure something out.”
“I think we’ve tried everything we could without monsters.”
“If it's not a really specific condition or a really difficult effect, then we’ll need monsters to figure it out.”
So, we abandoned our attempts to uncover the passive.
Unfortunately, this put us in a difficult position.  We had started researching the Dragon Armor to find a way to escape this place.
“So back to square one?” 
Baekho’s words, filled with disappointment, spread through the air, echoing the feeling of defeat in the hearts of everyone present.
It’s the leader's job to not show how disheartened they are.
“Let’s start with the things we can do, slowly.”
I tried to sound encouraging, but my words lacked conviction. I felt like a leader who had just lost the battle.
We resumed our search for the Golden Ruins, hoping to find some clue. We scoured every passageway again, even resorting to physical means like breaking down walls. We even went back up the steps at the entrance and revisited the hidden chamber of the Golden Ruins, the chamber of the Machairo.
“...Huh?”
What was happening?
“...Wow, this is creepy.”
The Machairo’s corpse, which should have been inside the sarcophagus, was gone.
