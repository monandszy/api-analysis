## The Pilgrim (5)
“A pilgrim! Stop her—!”
*KWAJIK*
I sprinted through the passage, smashing the heads of Imperial soldiers in my path. My stats continued to rise slightly with each kill, but it wasn't noticeable in the current situation. 
‘At this pace, I should reach the destination within an hour…'
Despite giving it my all, my troubled mind refused to settle.
“Bjorn… When will Erwen get here?”
Even Ainar was worried. How could I not be?
“…”
Was something wrong?
Could she have been injured, or worse… dead?
My heart pounded with a mix of anxiety and dread. But there was nothing else I could do right now except to keep running, trusting that Erwen would eventually arrive.
“Character has slain 405 Imperial soldiers.”
“All stats increased by +1.”
“Character has slain 410 Imperial soldiers.”
“All stats increased by +1.”
“Character has slain 415 Imperial soldiers…”
“…”
Time blurred. 
‘30 minutes.’
My worry for Erwen grew with each passing minute. Then, abruptly, I stopped in my tracks. 
“Didn't I tell you, Pilgrim?”
“…”
“There's only one way you can escape this cave alive.”
Dreadfear stood before us, blocking our path.
***
There was one thing I didn't understand. He wasn't chasing us from behind; how could he be ahead of us? We'd even gained speed from increased stats. 
‘He… caught up?’
A sense of unease washed over me. But there was something I needed to do before delving into my questions. 
“Ainar, get ready to fight.”
As soon as I gave the order, Ainar lowered her fallen comrade's body to the ground. 
“…Rest for a while, Mage.”
Dreadfear watched us, his lips curling in a cruel sneer.
“Foolish things.”
Whatever. Not running away at the sight of him simply meant it was worth a try. 
‘With my stats now, it’s definitely possible.’
I lowered my body behind my shield. It was just a habit; not a meaningful posture. A cheap metal shield was meaningless against a Knight wielding Aura.
“…”
We stood in tense silence, waiting for the attack. Then, he muttered casually,
“My offer still stands.”
Was this guy really insane? He couldn't possibly still be hung up on that.
However, he seemed willing to talk, so I seized the opportunity.
“….What happened to Erwen?” 
The question and anxiety I'd been carrying for hours during our race.
He answered briefly, 
“That woman Pilgrim? She's dead.”
“Bullshit.”
“You deny your inner voice.”
Damn, I should've just kept my mouth shut.  As a Boss with a betrayal fetish, believing his words would be foolish. 
“Faith cannot change truth. No matter how righteous you believe yourselves to be, you're nothing but dirty traitors—.”
I didn't need to hear any more.
“Ainar!”
I dashed forward as soon as I gave the signal.  He retaliated, unleashing Aura.
Therefore….
*TADAT*
I took a step back before reaching him.  Taking advantage of the opening, Ainar closed the distance.
And…
“Behel—laaaAAAAAH!”
He twisted his body sideways as her sword came down with the force of a mountain.
*KWAANG*!
Her sword slammed into the ground where he'd been standing. But it wasn't a wasted attack yet.
Hitting, retreating, then exploiting the resulting opening to thrust your weapon. That's the basis of 합격술 (hapgeokseul) [martial art that focuses on striking openings and hitting vulnerable areas of the body], after all.
*TADAT*
In the instant I avoided his sword strike, I threw my useless shield at his face. As his vision was blocked…
*TADAT*
I quickly dashed forward and swung my mace. He reacted, as always.
“!”
His sword intercepted my mace's path. If we collided, the metal mace would shatter for sure.
*SUUUK*
I forced my strength, twisting the mace's trajectory.
*HUUNG*!
Immediately after the mace passed by his sword and cut through empty air…
*PUUK*!
Ainar's blade pierced his shoulder.
‘Okay, so we scored the first point.’
But I wasn't satisfied.  There was no reason to waste time retreating here.
Combat is essentially a game of wits.
Attack.
Block.
Evade.
In the blink of an eye, you must choose one of those three options; your next choice depends on that.  That's why we were relentlessly limiting his options.
*TADAT*
He focused on blocking and evading, overwhelmed. Attacking had become too risky for him.
But he wasn’t free to just block or evade.
‘Left.’
Yes, with that posture, he'd evade to the left. 
*PWEOK*!
His stance crumbled under the relentless barrage of attacks. He was forced to choose a subpar option to minimize further losses.
It made it easier for us to read his next move, and he lost even more options. A vicious cycle.
However…
“…”
No matter how much we pressured him, I couldn't let my guard down. He still had Aura, a powerful card to play.  After all, combat inevitably involves variables.
Just like this.
*HUIK*!
I twisted the mace's path again, feigning an attack, before it could touch his blade, but the outcome was completely different.
“!”
His sword moved in tandem with the mace as if he had anticipated my actions.  I had to use my core strength to force another trajectory to avoid losing my weapon. It forced me to reveal an opening.
*PWEOK*
He didn't miss his chance. He kicked me in the abdomen.  It didn't do much damage. The problem came next.
We were both significantly depleted.
*PUUK*!
Ainar's sword pierced his thigh.
And at the same time…
*PUUK*!
I was stabbed in the stomach.
‘Damn, it stings.’
I never thought he’d take such a bold move from that position.
Despite seeing me stabbed, Ainar didn’t ask if I was okay.  Instead, she just went in for another attack.
“Hwaaat!”
I hurriedly recovered and rejoined the battle.  It wasn't like my bleeding would stop by retreating.
The key wasn't how badly I was injured.
It was whether I could kill this guy before I died.
If defeating him ended the raid and allowed me to escape, injuries were meaningless.
“Behel—laaaAAAAAH!”
The battle continued, a heart-stopping dance of death. 
Despite my greatly increased stats, two against one wasn't easy.
Our numerical advantage wouldn't last much longer either.
“For the Empire…!”
Imperial soldiers kept appearing out of nowhere, like moths to a flame.
They made the battle much harder, but there was an advantage.
*SEOKGEOK*
My weapon refilled.
*SUUK*
The moment my mace was cut, I grabbed a weapon from the corpse of a fallen soldier and charged again.
Sword, hammer, mace.
I didn’t discriminate. 
As long as it was long enough to swing with force, it was enough.
*KWAANG*!
Arm, leg, torso, shoulder, eye, ear.
The more my body was damaged, the more his condition deteriorated.
*HUIIK*!
The once-mighty aura of a Knight was fading; his movements were sluggish. His aura was smaller than before. One arm dangled uselessly; his left leg, pierced twice by Ainar, limped.
‘It’s almost over.’
We're going to win. This guy’s going to fall before we do.
Just as I thought that and swung my hammer at his temple…
“Dreadfear’s HP is below 15%.”
The impact sent me flying backwards, crashing against the wall.  The force reverberated through my skull, blurring my vision. I struggled to my feet and checked in front of me.
“Damn it.”
I couldn't help but swear.
“Dreadfear has used [Eternal Nightmare].”
“All HP is restored.”
He recovered from his injuries and walked towards me, his face unchanged.
“The offer…”
“…”
“Is still valid.”
As if.
I retorted,
“You… are you…”
“…”
“Your parents parrots?”
He didn't answer my question. 
Instead, he silently stabbed me in the gut.
“You’re… damn… game…”
My vision went black.
***
“Character’s HP is below 5%.”
“[Somnolence] activated.”
“Natural regeneration is significantly increased.”
“Character has fallen into a [昏迷 (hommi)] [unconscious state].”
***
In the pitch black darkness.
I felt weightless, as if floating on a flowing river. I thought,
Dreadfear, the King of Terror. 
How the hell are they supposed to defeat this guy?
The answer was simple.
Impossible.
I thought my enhanced stats would help defeat him, but it was a trap.
He was never meant to be defeated. 
Meaning…
‘I was wrong.’
My judgment was wrong.  Instead of fighting, I should've just run away from him, escaped from the cave.
‘It was a game of tag from the start.’
My stats were merely a slight boost to help me escape him.
A head-on fight was never the right answer.
Therefore…
“Huu… huuu….”
Now, I’m paying the price for choosing the wrong answer.
“Character’s HP is above 15%.”
“[昏迷 (hommi)] [unconscious state] has been changed to [麻痺 (mabi)] [paralyzed state].”
“Natural regeneration increase has been slightly reduced.”
When I opened my eyes, I was being carried by Ainar.
“Get her…!”
I heard the shouts of Imperial soldiers behind us as Ainar ran, dodging them.
“Huh? Bjorn...? Are you awake?”
“…”
“Are you… okay? Can you hear me?”
I forced my mouth to open.
“I… am… fine. Just… explain… the… situation…”
“Ah, ah! Ye… yes…!”
Ainar explained the situation as she ran.
“You… fainted… then… suddenly… the whole cave… lit up, and… he… stopped… moving. I… took… advantage of… the opportunity and… carried… you… and… ran…”
He stopped moving?
…Was it the Altar's effect?
I didn’t know. It was a hidden piece, and without system logs, I couldn’t even tell what was causing what.
“Time…?”
“I… don’t… know. Five minutes? Maybe… that… long…?”
I was unconscious for about 5 minutes.
“But, are… you… okay?”
“I… am… fine. I… can’t… move… only… that’s… all…”
What was going on?
As I pondered, one thing came to mind.
‘[Somnolence].’
A passive skill that activates when my HP drops below 5%.
It changes to [麻痺 (mabi)] [paralyzed state] at 15% and my HP gradually recovers. The status effect disappears at 30%. 
‘I… had… a skill… too.’
I had a starting skill, too, not just Bersil and Erwen.
It just took a while to realize it was a passive skill.
‘Then… Ainar… probably… has… something… too…’
What could her skill be? 
I didn’t know, but I didn’t have time to experiment and find out.
“Left… side… side….”
“Huh?”
“Left… side… path… is… the… way… forward…”
“Ah…!”
I directed her while trying to organize my thoughts.
As we moved, I heard a particularly loud sound.
“Huu… huuu…”
It was a different kind of breath than just labored panting.
“Ainar… Are… you… okay?”
“…Fine…!”
No, she doesn't look fine at all.
“Just… can’t… use… my… hands. I… got… hurt… a… bit. Don’t… worry… about… me…”
I realized that Ainar couldn't use her hands since she was carrying me.
Then, how did she deal with the Imperial soldiers?
Were they lucky enough to never attack her head-on?
I was soon to see the answer with my own eyes.
“…Filthy Pilgrims!”
A group of soldiers appeared directly in front of us, blocking our path.
Ainar’s choice was simple.
To not stop.
Instead, she sped up and charged at the soldiers.
*PUUK*!
She was exposed, with her arms behind her back. The sharp weapons were swung, but she just endured it, guarding against any vital attacks.
And as a result...
Shoulder.
Arm.
Leg.
She suffered minor injuries in three places, but she was past the soldiers in an instant. 
The soldiers who’d been bypassed joined the rest, pursuing us. Ainar’s breathing became slightly harsher.
“Huu… huuu…”
I watched, unable to speak as she carried me. 
But, as if sensing my worry, she asked me, 
“Bjorn… Are you… hurt… anywhere?”
“….Stop.”
This was too reckless.  She’d collapse soon, and even if we reached our destination, how could she treat those wounds?
Without potions?
It was better to drop me and wait for [Somnolence] to wear off. Then, we could move together.
However...
“Can’t… do… that.”
She insisted, no matter what argument I used.
“Be, cause… I… saw… the… future… when… you… collapsed.”
“….The future?”
“When… the… Mage… died… I… saw… that… too. I… thought… it… was… just… an… illusion… then… but… I… think… it’s… my… ability.”
What did she see to make her like this?
She didn’t answer, no matter how many times I asked.
“I… can’t… stop. So… trust… me.”
“…”
“I… will… never… collapse.”
With those words, she resumed walking, no matter how many times I tried to reason with her.
*TUBUK* *TUBUK*
No matter how many Imperial soldiers appeared in front of her.
She wouldn’t stop.
