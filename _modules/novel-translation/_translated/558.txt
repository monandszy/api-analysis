## The First Clear (3)
The formation of the expedition team was a masterpiece of tactical arrangement, each member meticulously placed according to their class and strengths. Ranged attackers were strategically positioned amongst melee fighters, while a squad of knights formed a formidable flank. This wasn’t the haphazard grouping of earlier, where ranged units stayed at the back and melee fighters held the front line. Each member occupied their designated space with the utmost consideration, ensuring maximum stability and tactical flexibility in every situation.
I was no exception. My position was directly in front of the stone gate, a solitary sentinel standing between the relentless onslaught and the waiting expedition. It meant facing the monstrous entity alone, shouldering the brunt of its attacks. But there were no complaints, for this was the agreed upon strategy, the best chance we had.
The beast from the ancient tales emerged from the stone gate, its low growl reverberating through the cavern. It surveyed its surroundings, its gaze settling upon me. Perhaps the sight of a lone warrior, armed with a shield, seemed peculiar to its monstrous sensibilities. 
“Fancy a closer look?”
A guttural chuckle escaped my throat. It was my first encounter with a First-Class monster, a fact that didn’t escape my attention. A wave of nervous energy coursed through me, tightening the muscles in my limbs. Yet, the fiery spirit of a Barbarian only burned brighter in the face of formidable enemies.
I gripped my shield, a surge of adrenaline electrifying my veins. The beast, towering twice my size, was an intimidating sight. Its massive frame was draped in crimson fur, its eyes glowed with an infernal light, and three tails, each tipped with a pulsating orb, lashed around it. A thick, blood-red mist swirled around its form, adding an aura of both mystery and dread. 
“Never seen a Barbarian before?”
The beast tilted its head slightly, its eyes fixed on me, as if trying to decipher my existence. The moment was perfect for initiating combat.
“Behel—laaaaahhhh—!!”
I roared, a battle cry that echoed through the cavern. With all my might, I swung my mighty hammer, aimed at the beast’s nose. It was a blow with the raw power of a thunderclap.
The beast didn’t budge. It seemed to merely shrug off the blow, unperturbed by my attack. However, I had successfully landed the first strike.
“!”
The speed of the beast was formidable, far beyond human comprehension.  Before I could even react, its gaping maw was clamped down on my shield.  The impact shook me to my core, but a wry smile formed on my face. My shield was different.
“Not gonna break, you little shit.”
This First-Class monster couldn’t pierce the indestructible barrier woven into my single-numbered shield.  The problem was, it was my strength that was failing.
“Uh oh, this isn’t good!”
With a swift movement, the beast lifted me, shield and all, and began violently shaking its head. The feeling of nausea was overwhelming, but releasing the shield was unthinkable. It was all I had. I clung on for dear life, gritting my teeth against the onslaught of disorientation.
Just as I feared my grip was going to fail, reinforcements arrived.
“Gahyeon Vesillus has cast the First-Class offensive spell, ‘Cradle of Rupture.’”
The head mage of the expedition team, drawing upon the combined power of dozens of mages, unleashed a First-Class offensive spell.
——————!
A flash of blinding light engulfed the cavern, and when I regained my senses, I was rolling on the ground. I scrambled to my feet, looking around in a daze. The beast, badly wounded, lay crumpled on the ground. 
“Gooooooooo—!!”
It roared in pain, its fur singed and its leg visibly injured. But I, miraculously, was unharmed. Despite the proximity to the First-Class spell, I hadn’t been turned into a slab of raw meat like in the Blood Citadel. 
“Damage inflicted by allied characters in a ‘Bond’ state.”
“The ‘Trust’ effect protects the character from damage.”
It was the Bond spell I had cast with the mage, the reason why the number on the spell ‘Trust’ was 12.  In this world, the effect of not taking damage from allied attacks was immensely powerful.
“The next strike from the mage will be in about 3 minutes, while they recover their mana.”
This meant a lot of things. We needed to make the most of the next 3 minutes.  Facing a First-Class monster, 3 minutes was not a lot of time.
“Kashan has cast ‘Triple Gaze.’”
The beast spread its three tails, and the orbs at the tip of each tail glowed brightly.
“Phooong! Phooong! Phooong!”
Lasers, like those in the movies, erupted from the orbs.
“Left tail is magical damage with curse, right tail is physical damage with defense reduction, and the middle one is a combination of both with the summoning of token mobs.”
I recalled the effects of each tail and braced myself against the onslaught of lasers.
“Block successful.”
“Aegis Barrier absorbed all damage.”
“Block successful.”
“Aegis Barrier absorbed all damage.”
“Block successful.”
“Aegis Barrier absorbed all dama—.”
Normally, the skill would hit randomly, but due to my high threat level, all attacks were directed at me.  Yet, amidst the successful blocks…
“Character has lost its balance.”
My footing slipped, and I stumbled, completely off guard. The laser caught me in my weak spot, a direct hit.
“Character receives 10% increased damage.”
That was the defense-reduction tail. I couldn’t let the stack get too high.
“Damn my luck.”
It was a mistake I would never have made under normal circumstances. But I couldn’t blame myself.  It was simply the effect of the beast’s skill.
“Bad Omen” was a skill that fixed my luck stat at -200. Within this aura, such misfortunes were commonplace, happening one after another.
“Evasion failed.”
“Critical hit.”
“Character receives a massive increase in damage.”
The force of the attack should have broken my arm, but instead, I felt my joints dislocate. And amidst the chaos…
“Kashan has cast ‘Life Drain.’”
Translucent red threads erupted from the bodies of every expedition member in the library, connecting them to the beast. 
This was the beast’s only recovery skill. With over 200 people in the library, Kashan’s wounds rapidly healed.  However, thanks to our preparedness, the situation was under control.
“Cut the threads!”
“Auras! Use your auras!”
Immediately upon connection, every knight strategically positioned in the library swiftly cut the threads with their swords, halting the beast’s recovery.  Those threads, normally requiring multiple strikes to sever, were instantly severed by auras that ignored physical resistance and magic resistance by 90%.
“Okay, recovery skill disabled.”
We had bought ourselves about 2 minutes before the skill could be used again.
“Charge!!”
As the commander barked the order, dozens of knights charged at the beast, swords drawn.  Despite their unwavering loyalty, there was a lingering sense of unease. This creature could turn on us at any moment. Yet, in the back of my mind, I couldn’t help but wish…
“Nia Rafdonia…!”
For everyone to survive this encounter.
***
“Scur, phoo, whoosh!”
The knights, their auras cutting through Kashan’s hide like knives, unleashed their might alongside the ranged attackers, whose skill and precision were evident in every attack.  Their firepower was unmatched, a barrage of attacks that would be unthinkable in a normal situation.  
First-Class monsters had an astronomically high threat level. 
“If threat level exceeds 500, all monsters will prioritize attacking the wearer.”
Without my Aegis Barrier, which negated the threat level, the knights would have been torn limb from limb by now.
“I’m sure they would have eventually gotten it, but without me… about 100 of them would have died.”
It was the cost of victory, the price of their lives.  I was the only one who could stand against this beast.  I had saved countless lives.  Surely, the commander would acknowledge my contribution.
“Kashan has cast ‘The End of Fire.’”
A crimson shadow began to spread across the floor.  We had anticipated this skill as the second most dangerous in its arsenal.
“Evacuate now!!”
The deputy commander, acting as the operator, yelled, and within a second, a pillar of fire erupted from the crimson shadow that had spread across the floor.  It was a near-instantaneous area of effect attack.
“That’s the direction Raven is in…!”
My heart skipped a beat.  I glanced over to see Raven being dragged by Ainar, both of them sprinting through the panicking mages, a blur of darkness against a backdrop of chaos.
“Phew… she’s safe.”
But I couldn’t relax. The End of Fire had a follow-up attack.
“Mages, deploy barriers!”
The deputy commander’s order was followed immediately by the mages, who activated protective barriers.  The follow-up attack was weaker, but not entirely negated by the barriers.
“Shooosh!”
A series of barriers were rapidly deployed, forming a protective circle around the area where the pillar of fire had erupted.
“Thud thud thud thud thud…”
The troops from the back lines scrambled for cover, seeking refuge within the barriers, desperately trying to escape the inferno.  But some were not so fortunate.
“No!…”
“Aaaaaah!”
One mage and a ranger assigned to help with the evacuation were engulfed in the flames, vaporized in a flash of light.  Witnessing the death of his comrade, a knight clenched his jaw and shouted: 
“Elton Fassier of the second squad, and Quilkan Battleln of the third squad, both dead!”
Even in a chaotic situation, reporting the casualties was a priority for soldiers.
“I need to focus.”
Every skill of a First-Class monster was a potential death sentence.  Even Kashan’s lasers could vaporize a mage in a single hit if they were to hit anyone other than me.  
I had to play my part perfectly. Lives depended on it.
“Behel—laaaahhh—!!”
I unleashed my ‘Barbaric Rage,’ amplifying my threat level even further.  Then, I pressed forward, drawing closer to the beast. 
“The chant has been completed!”
“Attack squad, fall back!”
As the mages finished their chant, the knights surrounding me retreated.  And with a thunderous roar…
——————!
The First-Class spell hit Kashan squarely. It was aimed at a more vulnerable spot this time.
“Kashan has cast ‘The End of Fire.’”
The beast unleashed another area-of-effect attack.
“Kashan has cast ‘Death Sentence.’”
A new skill.  It was the most dangerous skill, the one we had deemed most threatening in our simulations.
***
“Death Sentence.”
The name alone conjured images of instant death, but it wasn’t a true instant death skill.  It simply mimicked the effect.
“Character receives a massive increase in damage proportional to their luck stat.”
Damage amplification based on luck.
“‘Death Sentence’ damage amplification is 200% per 10 luck.”
A typical First-Class monster skill.  The problem was Kashan’s base luck stat.  Years of research revealed that it was about 500.
“10,000%.”
A direct hit meant certain death.  Even a seasoned knight would die in one or two hits from a First-Class monster’s basic attack.  My physical resistance was high, but if the attack wasn’t blocked, my bones would break. 
Of course, if I could land a proper ‘guard’ with my shield…
“Block successful.”
“Aegis Barrier absorbed all damage.”
The problem was, it was a gamble.
“Phew…”
Thankfully, I had successfully blocked the first Death Sentence.  But was there any guarantee it would happen again?
“Thump thump thump thump!”
My heart hammered against my ribs.  A sudden wave of weakness washed over me, making my legs tremble.  With a surge of adrenaline, I forced my legs to work, calculating the number of attacks I had to endure.
“Three or four.”
If we could end this quickly, three. But if things dragged on, four.
“Will I be able to block them all?”
The question lingered in the back of my mind.  I couldn’t help but smile.  Blocking or not blocking the attack was irrelevant.  I would endure, no matter what. Even if my limbs were ripped apart, my organs shredded, I would not yield. 
It was the only way to win.
“Kashan has cast ‘Life Drain.’”
The chaotic battle raged on.  Every expedition member was doing their part. 
“Kashan has cast ‘The End of Fire.’”
Another pillar of fire erupted, incinerating everything in its path.  Casualty reports came in. The only solace I found was that none of my comrades were amongst the fallen.
“Gahyeon Vesillus has cast the First-Class offensive spell, ‘Cradle of Rupture.’”
The third spell hit Kashan right on its head.  It was a powerful attack, but the beast, as expected, was still alive and well. It continued to fix its gaze on me, with a ferocity that was both unnerving and mesmerizing.
“Block successful.”
“Aegis Barrier absorbed all damage.”
The second Death Sentence was successfully blocked, a stroke of pure luck.
“Kashan has cast ‘Destiny’s Crossroads.’”
It was a skill the beast unleashed when its health dropped below 50%.
“Phooong! Phooong! Phooong!”
Its tails continued to unleash their lasers, some piercing my defenses, while others were blocked. 
“Character receives increased damage.”
“Character has been cursed.”
“Plague Wolves charge towards the area with the highest concentration of troops.”
The beast summoned token mobs.  Another End of Fire erupted, this time targeting my position.  I was unable to dodge, as the beast lunged at me.
“Character’s health is below 20%.”
“Passive skill ‘Hero’s Path’ activates, increasing resistance and immunity.”
My body felt like it was melting, but I didn’t dissolve.  My flesh sizzled and burned, my organs felt like they were being roasted alive.  I couldn’t breathe properly, but the magical resistance kept me alive.
And as long as I was alive, I wouldn’t give up.
“Shooosh!”
I stood my ground, receiving a healing spell from the cleric.  The shield was still in my hand.  Just as I was about to charge…
“Kashan has cast ‘Death Sentence.’”
The third Death Sentence arrived at the perfect moment.
“…”
Time seemed to slow down, my mind racing. Only one question haunted me.
“In this state… could I survive another attack?”
I asked the question, and the answer was painfully obvious.
“No.”
It was as simple as 1+1 = 2.  The realization dawned on me, and my vision blurred.  But time never stopped.
“Block successful.”
“Aegis Barrier absorbed all damage.”
The beast’s front leg slammed down on my shield, a thunderous blow. 
But it wasn’t just a lucky block.  I had blocked it perfectly.  No unexpected stumbles, no unforeseen circumstances.
“…”
It didn’t feel real.  Had I actually survived?
“Cough!”
Air rushed into my lungs, filling the empty void left by the breathlessness that had gripped me.  I hadn’t even realized I had stopped breathing.  The inhalation felt like fire in my damaged lungs.
“Thump thump thump thump!”
My heart pounded in my chest, a wild rhythm that refused to be tamed. And just then…
“Erwen Fornach di Tercia has summoned ‘The Dark Spirit King, D’Clore.’”
The familiar dark orbs burst into existence, raining down on the beast.  The moment had arrived for a full-scale, focused barrage.  Our last stand.
“Yes, in this condition, we could take it down before the fourth…!”
But variables are called variables for a reason, appearing when you least expect them.
“Oops…?”
My forward stride was suddenly halted.  It felt like I had stepped on something slippery.
“Character tripped over an object.”
When I regained my senses, I was met with the face of the beast, its maw inches from mine.  
“Crunch, crunch.”
I could hear the beast chewing on my head.  Its massive teeth scraped against my skull.
“My senses were still intact, but I felt no pain.”
“Character’s brain has been severely damaged.”
“Character has fainted.”
It was my last memory.
