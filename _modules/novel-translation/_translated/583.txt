## Chapter 583: Opening the Door (4)
A long, straight corridor.  Actually, calling it a corridor might be a bit of a misnomer, given its structure. While its proportions were similar to a corridor, its absolute width was significantly different.  This place felt three times larger than the grand hall in the palace where the royal decree was given...
Swoosh-
Even with the flare illuminating the space, its end was still out of sight. The dark shadows cast by the stone statues lining the walls created an eerie atmosphere. 
"Guardian statues..."
What kind of place is this? This doesn't seem like a dungeon suited for group play, but individual challenges instead.
I kept my guard up, expecting any potential threats while I waited for the arrival of the agreed upon time, when portals began to appear in the air.
Whoosh—
Portals, just large enough for a single person to pass through.  Each portal opened for a brief moment, spitting out one person before vanishing, as if they had served their purpose.
"Thankfully, she's safe."
Amelia, appearing right after me.
"Ugh… It's a bit spooky here, don't you think?"
Next came Ainar, the warrior, looking completely devoid of her usual fighting spirit, as if the enthusiasm had been sucked out of her.  Following her, more portals continued to open, bringing in our fellow adventurers.
"There may be traps around, so stay put and wait for my instructions!"
The entire temporary party of four had arrived, but I didn’t start exploring right away.  Instead, I waited for the rest of the group.  No rush; the search could wait until everyone was ready.
The third, second, and first parties...
I waited patiently, as over a hundred people entered one after the other. Among them was the Village Chief.
"Magicians, secure the perimeter first! Everyone else, hold back and await orders!"
The Village Chief, shouting at the top of his lungs, with Jerome Saintred’s face.  His natural acting skills brought a slight sense of unease, but also a small measure of relief.
Right, he did actually enter.
I had been worried that he wouldn’t, leaving me stranded here all alone.
"Alright, everyone's in…."
There didn’t seem to be a limit to the number of people allowed in, or perhaps the limit was very high.
Of course, this didn’t make me purely happy.  In the nature of [Dungeon & Stone], dungeons like this were mostly known to have difficult levels.
"Lord Yandell, what should we do from here?"
The Village Chief approached me, asking for my opinion, but I merely pretended to express my views and conveyed my instructions to him.
"Hmm… makes sense."
The Village Chief, as if trying to hide his lack of actual authority, pretended to ponder for a moment before giving instructions to the Vice Commander.
"First, we'll form a reconnaissance team to begin the search!"
Thus, the search commenced.
Knights were the first to investigate the surroundings, and if they found anything suspicious, they would call the magicians over for a closer look.
Before I knew it, a map of the dungeon was already complete.
"It’s so convenient having so many people at my disposal."
It feels like cheating, but it truly is.  If it were just our clan, Anabada, it would have taken ages to even create this map.
“No monsters detected within the radius.”
“Don't touch the statues!  There’s a faint but discernible magical energy emanating from them!"
“We’ve crossed the rift, but it seems we haven’t entered the rift’s interior.”
“All the terrain features here have regenerative properties.”
Tasks that would normally take an entire day are finished instantly with the combined efforts of a larger force.  All I had to do was sit back, listen to the reports with the Village Chief, gather information, and make decisions.
“This is... the taste of power?”
Compared to the wild expeditions I’ve been on before, this ease of operation seems almost barbaric.
I started to organize the accumulated information in my head, rather than using a pen.  In my estimation, there are three crucial points:
1. The Guardian Statues. 
The magicians’ suspicions seem correct; these statues are more than just decorative pieces.  They definitely have a role, and I have a hunch about it.  Well, perhaps it’s more accurate to say that I have an expectation.
"I'll get to that later, since it’s not yet confirmed…."
2. The Possibility of New Guardian Species.
All the statues depicted Guardians from the fifth floor and below.  However, what’s peculiar is that even the Vampire Duke Cambormier, a kind of hidden boss, was among these statues.
The real problem lies elsewhere.
“Why are these here?”
Among these Guardian statues are creatures I’ve never seen before.  They weren't unidentified, though.  Even if they were Guardians, just as Cambormier’s true nature was a Rank 5 Vampire Monster, most of these Guardians themselves were creatures whose experience points I had already obtained.
But here’s the thing...
“Draykes shouldn’t be Guardians...?”
There's a monster, which doesn’t appear as a ‘Guardian’ in any rift, standing proudly among the Guardian statues.
Could these statues not simply be a collection of Guardian monsters? All the other statues possess Guardian characteristics.  Take the Lycanthrope statue, for instance.  The only Lycanthrope wielding an ice club is Tarunbas, the Tyrant of the Ice Cave.
“If they are truly one of the Guardians… it means a new type of Guardian essence has emerged!"
“But nothing has been confirmed yet.”
"No, I'm certain! Just as Lord Yandell once obtained the essence from a Vampire Guardian, these are Guardians of rifts yet to be discovered, just like that Vampire!"
Perhaps it’s truly a case similar to the Crimson Citadel.  It’s not easy to accept that there are many rifts I didn’t even know existed, but...
The longer I stay in this world, the more I realize that my arrogance stems from the belief that I know everything about [Dungeon & Stone].  Take this first floor, for example.  I didn’t know about the possibility of upgrading Vampire Essence to Ogre Essence using the Restrained Wish.
Anyways, let’s move on to the next.
3. The Massive Stone Gate.
Past the statues, at the end of the corridor, there's a massive stone gate.  Even with a Rank 1 spell, we couldn’t even scratch it.  And…
4. That’s all.
To put it simply, we need to fulfill certain conditions using these clues.  Only then can we open this gate and proceed to the next stage. 
Therefore…
"We've gathered enough information from the search, so gather everyone. No, it would be better to gather them."
I gave the Village Chief, who’s basically a figurehead, the order to gather everyone.  These clues are enough, right?
“Prepare for combat!”
The Vice Commander, following the Village Chief’s order, shouted, and I walked towards the statues, moving slowly through the tense atmosphere.
Then…
Thump, thump.
I placed my hand on the most harmless looking King Slime statue, for the first time.
Zzzzt—
An electric-like sensation flowed from my fingertips where they touched the statue.  I instinctively knew that something had been activated.  However…
"A portal?"
A portal materialized around the statue.
***
The portal opened.  The portal emerged from the location we reached after passing through the mysterious stone gate on the first floor.  However, it's not too difficult to guess where this portal leads.
“Could it lead to the Green Mine…?”
“It seems highly likely.”
From the murmurs I could hear, other adventurers seemed to be thinking the same thing.  But I didn’t rush to confirm.
"We need to decide who will go in first."
There’s no guarantee that this portal actually leads to the Green Mine, and I can’t be sure how many people can go through a single portal.  So, I began the selection process with utmost care.
After all, there were three types of portals.
1. Portals that activate permanently once opened and remain active until the dungeon closes.
The Dimensional Obelisk is an example of this.  However, in the case of rifts, this kind of portal hasn’t been seen yet, so this is a less likely possibility.
2. Portals that aren't single-use, but only remain active until the allotted number of people pass through.
The first floor rifts are prime examples.  When a rift opens, dozens of portals appear throughout the first floor, and they all vanish once five people have crossed them.
And lastly…
3. Single-use portals.
The Doppelganger Forest on the fourth floor is this type.  There’s only one chance to use the portal.  However, anyone who’s in a pact with the user at the time of entering will be transported as well.
Oh, as a side note, even if six people are in a pact, all six will be transported, which was confirmed a long time ago.
"Alright, that's the selection process done…."
Whether it’s a five-member or six-member team.  I created teams based on multiples of five and six, such as ten, twelve, fifteen, and eighteen, and even decided their entry order.
All this may be pointless, but it’s my belief that not preparing beforehand is a sin in the dungeon.
But…
"I'll go in first."
After renewing our pact, I carefully stepped into the portal and soon found myself in a place that baffled me.
"…"
Railroad tracks on the ground.  Scrap materials scattered around.  A broken wagon with coal inside.  This is all fine.  This is definitely the Green Mine.
However, there’s a serious problem.
"What the hell? Why isn’t anyone else coming in?"
Why hasn’t anyone else entered even after time has passed?
"…"
Just in case, I explored the surroundings and waited for a while, but the portal didn’t show any signs of reopening.  My mind grew even more confused.
“Why isn’t anyone coming in?”
Did something happen outside?  Could the Village Chief be up to something… again?  Or maybe everyone’s entered already, but our starting points are different, and we just can’t find each other?
“…I guess I'll go on alone."
Regardless of the reason, waiting here is pointless.  I slowly started exploring.  This is no ordinary Green Mine.  Even if a powerful monster appears, it wouldn’t be surprising.
I repeatedly reminded myself not to let my guard down and cautiously proceeded forward, when...
"…Huh?"
I hadn’t even walked for long before I came across a clearing.  And…
[Gyu-ii-iit—!]
Suddenly, the Green Mine’s Guardian appeared.  Normally, I would have had to walk much further after defeating the mid-boss...
Kwak-!
The moment it saw me, it lunged, so I bashed its head in with my hammer.
"You've defeated the King Slime."
“Guardian defeat bonus. EXP + 3.”
…The experience points seem to be registering properly.  But just in case, I’ll put that aside for now.
Swoosh—
As soon as I defeated it, a portal materialized, and I stared blankly at it.
“This is it…?”
It’s a little anticlimactic, but I think this is the end.  Unless there’s another event waiting beyond this portal.
The portal didn’t seem like it would disappear right away, so I calmed myself and inspected the area where the King Slime had fallen.
“Damn it, I wish it had dropped a Rift Stone.”
The loot was just a single rainbow-colored essence, proof of the Guardian’s existence.  It’s trash in my books.  Even if I put it in a vial to sell it, it wouldn’t bring much profit, and...
There’s no magician around to put it in a vial.  I’m not going to eat it.
Thump.
I tossed the Guardian Essence aside without any remorse and quickly entered the portal back outside.
“Ah, sir…!!”
Thankfully, the portal dropped me back to where I was.
“Bjorn…!”
“Th, thank goodness! Captain!!”
“What happened inside?”
My team members rushed to me, worried about my safety.  However, before telling them my story, I listened to what happened after I entered the portal.
Why didn’t anyone else follow me?
The answer to that question was exactly what I expected.  A truly unfortunate reality.
"It’s not that they didn’t enter.  They couldn’t.  The portal vanished right after you went in, Yandell."
…So, it truly was a one-person rift.
Well, it’s still better than them not coming in because something happened outside…
"Huu…."
I couldn’t help but sigh.
I turned my gaze away from my comrades and scanned the statues lining the corridor.  Guardians from below the fifth floor, each with different types, levels, and strategies.
"I have to take down all of these alone…"
I could already see the long, arduous journey ahead.
