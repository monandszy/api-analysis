## Chapter 456: Raid (1)
[Dungeon & Stone] is a farming game. The primary source of enjoyment comes from strengthening your character through activities like gaining experience, consuming essence, and acquiring equipment. 
Typically, players level up by consuming essence and then hunting for experience points to reach the next level. This is because you only earn experience points from your first kill of a particular monster. Without using essence to strengthen your character, you can't even acquire experience points.
"How come I haven't encountered a single roadblock until level 7?"
This was largely due to the consumption of high-grade essence early on, such as the rank 7 Corpse Golem, the rank 5 Vampire, and the Orc Hero essence. Even just those three would've made me strong enough to easily clear the lower levels with just experience point gains. Later, consuming the Ogre essence with "Tempered Hope" also played a significant role.
Ah, the war raging in the royal family was also a boon. The [Transcendence] ability from the "Bion" essence obtained through military merit would've normally been something I could farm for only at this stage. 
"I guess this is the first time I've been truly stuck in terms of growth..."
Of course, the reason I haven't been able to progress further isn't due to my lack of skills. It's simply because the path to the 7th level has turned into a warzone, making it impossible to venture there.
Technically, my stats are strong enough to start grinding Bellarios right away if I could just reinforce my clan a bit more.
Therefore...
"Bjorn, how much longer do we have to wait here? The monsters here are too weak, and it's not even fun!"
I decided to make this exploration all about lower-level raids. Even looking back now, it was the best choice. It allows us to gain experience from the monsters we'll need to hunt later, practice teamwork, and even consume essence if we happen to find any during the raid.
Currently, each of us has one remaining essence slot.
"Just be patient. As I said before, the essence you need will be here."
The monster we're hunting now will drop an essence that will be quite useful for Ainár. It might not be a perfect endgame essence, but consuming it now will make her 30% stronger.
"Well, even so..."
However, Ainár seemed unconvinced.
"It's just a rank 5 essence, isn't it? Can't we just keep going up? We need to fight stronger enemies to show you how much I've grown! How much stronger I've become!"
Ah... that was the real problem.
I ignored her complaint and focused on chewing my dried meat.
How much time had passed? 
"Yandel."
Amelia, who had been resting while her summoned clone automatically hunted weaker monsters, called out to me.
At the same time, Erwen spoke up.
"There are people approaching again."
"Yes, someone is indeed coming this way. The number is..."
"Twelve."
"..."
Ugh, that's just rude...
I wish they wouldn't make this into some kind of competition.
"They'll arrive in about two minutes."
"I see."
After we waited for a short while, a team of twelve adventurers emerged from the darkness.
Team, or should I say clan?
They were equipped quite well for adventurers who had only just reached the second level.
"..."
"..."
A brief exchange of scrutinizing glances.
The man who seemed to be the leader of their group approached us and spoke first.
"...There are those who came before us."
A simple sentence that confirmed their objective was the same as ours. Well, the monster we were hunting was well-known enough.
Since our goals were aligned, the solution was simple.
"Yes, there are those who came before us, so you should move along."
In technical terms, it's called "claiming the spot."
"..."
The opponent's leader licked his lips and scanned us.
In the past, I would've felt an immediate sense of unease at such a gaze.
But now, I felt nothing. 
"What a shame."
Well, what can he do if he's disappointed? 
"It's good fortune to encounter a celebrity like this. May the blessings of Laffdonia be with you, Baron Yandel."
They left without another word, just like the three teams we had encountered earlier.
And how much time had passed?
"The character has slain the Sandworm."
"The character has slain the Sandworm."
"The character has slain the Sandw..."
"..."
Finally, the conditions were met as we continued to hunt the Sandworms, a monster that appears exclusively in specific areas of the Rocky Desert.
"Oh, the ground is shaking!"
The desert shook as if an earthquake had struck.
Swoosh-
A sandstorm, as if to block our retreat, blew in.
Then, a giant worm rose from the ground, its maw wide open.
"A Deathworm appears."
The rank 5 Deathworm.  It appears in the lower levels, always as a superior variant. We often put it early on in our “experience farming" routes, as it's a creature that appears often.
[Kii-ye-ee-ee-ee-e-ee-eek-! ]
The Deathworm, with only its upper half above the ground, roared, sending shivers down our spines as it looked down at us. 
"Be-hel-laaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!"
Ainár shouted, not to be outdone, leaping high into the sky.
Sadly, she was too late.
"Amelia Rainwales has cast [Abyssal Might]."
"Erwen Fornach di Tersia has cast [Rupture]."
Before Ainár could even swing her greatsword, the Deathworm, pierced by arrows and blades, collapsed onto the sand.
"The Deathworm has been slain. EXP +5."
"Bonus for slaying a superior variant. EXP +1."
I wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't seen it, but it was a one-second kill.
"Weaker than I expected?"
"Uncle! I took it down!"
"What are you talking about? Didn't you see my sword cleaving the beast in half before your arrow hit?"
"But I was the one who took its head off with my arrow."
"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! What's this! I waited so long for this!!"
Ah, no essence dropped.
***
After defeating the Deathworm, we left the Rocky Desert and returned to the Crystal Cave on the first level.
The reason was simple.
It had been three months since our last visit to the Green Mine.
Now we could enter a confirmed rift on the first level.
"Come to think of it, I still haven't explored this place."
To be honest, we haven't actually been to every level. We skipped most of the lower levels, so the only places we've been to so far are the White Sanctuary on the third level and the Doppelganger Forest on the fourth.
The second level is where we spent the least amount of time, so I haven't even seen a rift open up there yet.
"Maybe I can go this time..."
Well, I'm not sure. The rift is included in our exploration plan for this trip, but you can't just waltz into a rift whenever you feel like it.
"Hahaha! This place feels familiar! It's nostalgic, somehow. Don't you agree, Bjorn?"
Ainár's words as soon as we reached the Great Sage Monument, located in the center of the Crystal Cave.
Well, I guess she would feel that way.
I felt something similar when I came here three months ago.
This is where Ainár and I first opened a rift, and where we first met Raven and that dwarf.
We also spent a few days in this very place, being surrounded by Noirque's men.
"That was three years ago..."
Though a significant amount of time is lost to traveling through the past, even with that considered, a lot of time has passed.
It feels like it was just the other day.
Thud.
I placed the rank 8 magic stone I had mined in the Rocky Desert on the altar. A portal opened, and we rushed inside.
"The character has entered the first level rift."
The last rift on the first level that I haven't cleared yet.
"This is the 'Iron Tomb'... "
Erwen lit the path with her spirit, and a hallway that seemed to trigger claustrophobia unfolded before us.
It felt like I had stepped into the interior of a pyramid, just like I had seen in a documentary.
Of course, there was a distinct difference from a pyramid.
The walls of the hallway, adorned with fresco-like patterns, were all made of metal.
"Uncle, what language is this?"
"I don't know."
"Hahaha! I think Aru would've loved this!"
"Enough chit-chat, let's move."
There was no point in wasting time, so we started exploring the rift.
Ah, Ainár was in the lead. 
She insisted on taking the lead...
Amelia and Erwen were also secretly curious about Ainár's skills, so I just let her have her way.
To be honest, I was also a bit curious. 
"Be-hel-laaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!"
Ainár, in the lead, started to clear the rift.
Normally, the "Iron Tomb" involves disarming traps and carefully finding your way to the last chapter, the tomb chamber, but this meant nothing to Ainár.
Traps are more efficient to destroy by stepping on them than to disarm.
If you have the strength.
"Ainár, left from there!"
"Woo-ooo-ooo-ooo!!!"
I just told her the way, and she would run ahead, step on the traps, and smash monsters with her greatsword.
Kaboom! Boom! Kaboom!
She's truly a greatsword warrior who specializes in easy kills.
"Ainár Frnellin has cast [Repeated Cleave]."
"Hitting the same area."
"The [Blast Scar] is activated."
The basic combo that synergizes with [Repeated Cleave].
But the growth she's achieved over the past few years is evident.
"[Tempered Oil] amplifies the power of [Blast Scar] by 200%."
The rank 5 Smug essence, which activates when a flame-based passive skill is used.
And…
"[Residual Heat] is activated."
"Deals additional damage proportional to the damage dealt."
The rank 4 essence that deals an additional 50% damage to multiple targets over a short period of time when dealing flame damage.
Boom! Kaboom! Boom!
With every swing of her sword, Ainár's combos triggered explosions, and I watched her proudly.
"I wouldn't have believed she actually consumed all the essence I recommended."
It felt like watching a student who had done an excellent job on their summer homework. I recommended only essences with good resistance stats, so she was impervious to stepping on traps or being hit directly by a monster's abilities.
Well, she'd heal up quickly anyway.
"Ainár Frnellin has cast [Wings of Greed]."
"Natural Regeneration is greatly increased."
Ainár's build focuses on passive damage, which means her soul force consumption is low. 
Except for her basic attack [Repeated Cleave], she has only one ultimate skill.
Therefore, she can continuously activate a healing skill without much burden.
"She has slain a rank 8 monster."
"Recovers soul force proportional to the rank of the monster."
Thanks to the level 3 effect [Predation] from the Slaughterer's Mark, her MP and HP both recharge as she fights.
From the looks of it, she has even activated her level 6 mark.
"She is engaged in battle with a rank 8 monster."
"Strength stat increases continuously based on the rank of the monster."
Woah, she even activated [Battle Learning]!
She gets stronger the more she fights. It's exactly the type of barbarian warrior I envisioned.
"...She must have a blast fighting like that."
A sense of deprivation crept in as I watched her exhilarating battle, but I quickly banished the thought.
Shield Barbarians are all about their unique style.
After all, in [Dungeon & Stone], if the main tank can't hold the line, you can't do anything.
You can raid without a cleric, mage, or archer, but you absolutely need a main tank.
"Be-hel-laaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!"
Anyway, we followed Ainár's lead, and as time passed, our initial experience points steadily accumulated.
"The character has slain the Mummy. EXP +1."
"The character has slain the Iron Knight. EXP +3."
"The character has slain the Buried One. EXP +2."
"The character has slain the Guardian's Eye. EXP +2."
"The character has slain the Iron Lizardman. EXP +3."
"The character has slain the Enigmatic Gatekeep..."
"..."
We also found two hidden pieces and shared them amongst us.
"The character has consumed Mercurial Liquid."
"Magic Resistance permanently increased by +3."
"This effect cannot be stacked."
"The character has received the Blessing of Iron."
"Physical Resistance permanently increased by +3."
"This effect cannot be stacked."
It's just the first level rift, so the stat increase is relatively low, but it will add up over time.
"The character has entered the Iron Tomb."
Despite exploring all there was to explore and defeating all the monsters, we didn't take long to reach the boss room.
About 3 hours, maybe.
"She's definitely fast with her solo hunting, clocking in at 3 hours."
While her skills are undeniably proven, Ainár still wasn't satisfied.  She insisted on soloing the boss fight.
And…
"The Iron Colossus Ildium has been slain. EXP +4."
"Bonus for slaying a superior variant. EXP +1."
"Bonus for slaying a guardian. EXP +3."
The brief boss fight was over.
Being adventurers, who are known for their greed, everyone's attention turned to the boss's corpse, which was now fading into a light.
Swoosh-
There was no essence.
Nor were there any Rift Stones, which are quite valuable.
But...
"...Flowers?"
"Huh? Was there a Number Item that was a flower?"
A Number Item dropped.
No. 9999, the Beginner's Luck. 
And a very rare one at that.
