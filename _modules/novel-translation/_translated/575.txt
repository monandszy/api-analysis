## Return (1)
A white mask, devoid of any defining features. 
A dull-colored robe enveloped the figure, concealing the body entirely, with only the hands, etched with wrinkles, visible.
“Hmm… Who’s that old man?”
“...”
The black mask and the butterfly, both bewildered by this unexpected visitor, exchanged confused looks. However, the Queen, a stranger to this face as well, responded differently.
“Could it be…?”
Though she had never seen him before, the circumstances seemed to have revealed his identity to her.
“Master…!”
The wolf, instantly recognizing the intruder’s identity, sprang to his feet and rushed towards him.
“It’s been a while, Wolf. How have you been?”
“Thanks to you, I’ve been well. But Master, what brings you here? You could’ve at least sent a message…?”
The wolf’s words hinted at a clear connection between the two, evident to all.
“This might be our last meeting. I decided to come by for a face-to-face. There are things I need to do here.”
“Things to do…?”
The wolf’s curiosity was piqued, but the Master offered no further details.  
He had a way of leaving people wanting more.
“Besides… Would you mind stepping aside for a moment? I’d like to greet the others.”
“Ah… Yes! I’m sorry!”
As the Master subtly urged him, the wolf immediately apologized and retreated to his spot.
He’s more like a dog than a wolf.
I observed the unfolding scene, my mind racing as the Master’s gaze landed on me.
“Cause and effect, a truly mysterious phenomenon. What’s it like, watching it all unfold?”
Unlike our first meeting at the Round Table, he no longer bothered to hide his true identity, ‘Auril Gaviss’.
There was no reason to find it strange.
[The Master of the Round Table is Auril Gaviss.]
The wolf had already revealed that information here.
It was probably with the Master’s permission that it surfaced in the first place.
Tick, Tock.
So, why did he reappear here?
Seeing the thick bond they shared, I figured he could’ve just sent the wolf with a message if that was the objective.
While calculating in my head, I responded nonchalantly.
“Nothing special.”
“Hmm, really? I thought you’d feel a little regret. After all, this place is practically your creation, isn’t it?”
Well, that's true.
Not the Round Table itself, but the system of this truth game.
“P, Phew??!”
“The Round Table… was made by that person…?”
The problem was the reactions of the members surrounding us.
***
One, two, three...  
“Ah, of course, this is all a story from twenty years ago… We only had the Evil Spirits from the Otherworld back then.”
Every exchange with the Master sparked a flurry of reactions.
“So the Round Table existed even twenty years ago…?”
“No, but more importantly… The Evil Spirits from the Otherworld…?”
Ugh, this is getting annoying.
Can’t they just keep their conversations to themselves?
I decided to ignore this part for now. Dealing with this old man was enough to make my head spin.
“So what’s it about then?”
“Didn’t I say? I had things to do. I came by to see your faces after all this time.”
The old man shifted his gaze, directing it towards another member.
“Good to see you again, Fox. How have you been?”
“You? Ah… Yes, yes… It’s been a while.”
“Honestly, I felt a bit hurt. You were so close to me back when there was nothing here, but now you don’t even think of me as your benefactor anymore, huh? Ha-ha.”
“W, what are you…!”
The mention of their past set the Fox visibly flustered, while the others lit up. 
Of course, he knew all this.
No need for explanations, it’s obvious.
This old man has a way to eavesdrop on every conversation here.
In other words…
‘…He’s been listening to everything we’ve been saying.’
A shiver runs down my spine.
I knew he was shady, but I didn’t know he had such terrible taste.
What’s truly chilling is the fact that he brazenly denied having seen the missing masks when he walked in.
Lying’s just a habit for him...
“Look… it’s not like that… I…  “
“No need for excuses. I truly don’t mind, so don’t worry about it.”
But his claim of not minding is probably true.
To this old man, the Fox is meaningless.  Even if she bled to death right in front of him, he wouldn't care if she was of no value to him. 
“Excuse me.”
The Queen, who had been observing silently, finally joined the conversation.
“Are you truly the Master of the Round Table… Auril Gaviss?”
“So it seems.”
“…I have a question. Wolf mentioned that you have the power to prevent the community’s closure… Is that true?”
“It is.  I was the one who weakened your power in the first place.”
Such a nonchalant statement.
The Queen took a long pause before asking again.
“…What?”
A sly grin spread across Auril Gaviss’ face as he continued. 
“You mentioned the device malfunctioned, but the device I gave that friend is perfectly fine. You just felt that way because the power I delegated to you gradually disappeared.”
“Delegated power… How is that even possible?”
“Well, I wouldn’t have transferred everything to him without keeping some for myself, wouldn’t I?”
A concise and clear answer that left the listeners speechless.
“Don’t be too disappointed. It’s just me getting back what was originally mine. Besides, haven’t you been using it well?”
“…”
“Alright, let’s end this conversation… “
Auril Gaviss smoothly silenced the Queen, took a few steps forward, and placed his hand on the Round Table’s jewel.
And in that instant.
Swish, swish, swish—
The jewel transformed into particles of light, as though the bodies of monsters in the labyrinth were vanishing, and flowed into Auril Gaviss’ fingertips. 
“Well, I’ve finished what I came to do.”
Unlike the other members who were simply stunned, I understood what that action meant.
Twenty years ago, Auril Gaviss had said that he lost most of his power over this space when he created the Round Table’s jewel.
Therefore, based on that, I concluded…
“He came to reclaim his power.”
With this, Auril Gaviss regained his former authority over this space.
“That’s right. Now I can do anything I want in this space.  Including this, for example.”
With a hand riddled with wrinkles, he waved through the air, and all the members’ masks except mine fell off.
Thud.
As though pulled by an invisible force, the masks slipped from their faces and landed on the table.
“Aahh!”
“…”
“P…hew?”
The members’ true faces, hidden behind the masks, were revealed, causing chaos.
Some covered their faces with both hands, some crouched down to hide, and others simply stared blankly into space.
Of course, not everyone reacted so passively.
Whoosh—
Two members, in a swift decision, logged out as soon as their masks fell off.
“They might be shy, unlike their appearances.  It’s not like they’re showing their real faces for the first time.  Everyone would’ve seen them by now.”
The first to disappear without even a goodbye was the Clown.
What did he look like again? 
He seemed to be white, but he disappeared too quickly for me to see properly.
He seemed a bit chubby, unlike what I expected… 
‘The other one who vanished… was the Black Mask.’
The Black Mask’s seat was empty.
He even fled faster than the Clown, leaving no trace at all.
Therefore, to prevent anyone else from escaping before I could see them, I quickly scanned the surroundings.
“…T, this is outrageous!”
The Queen, seemingly in a state of panic, revealed her face: a typical foreigner with blue eyes and blonde hair.
Not exactly a stunning beauty, though.
Just a plain-looking woman, probably in her early thirties.  The members looked surprised, but also skeptical. 
“Somehow…  her face seems familiar…?”
It’s likely not just my imagination.
The Queen is responsible for evaluating new members to determine if they are genuine players.
Anyway, next.
‘The Goblin…  ‘
He’s surprisingly handsome.
No, he’s incredibly handsome.
He could be an actor, perhaps?
His skin was dark, making me think he was from Southeast Asia, but he was actually a typical South American heartthrob.
‘Short for South American Heartthrob?’
South American Heartthrob.
It’s the same backward. A truly improbable coincidence—
‘…This isn’t important.’
I pretended not to care and rolled my eyes, taking in the exposed faces of all the members.
I know that their appearances in the community don’t mean much, but I was honestly curious.
What kind of people are they in real life?
‘The Butterfly is Asian.  The Fox is younger than I expected.  The Wolf is just an old man, as expected…  ‘
A secretive Round Table gathering.
A conversation between seasoned players. 
But the faces behind their mysterious masks were so ordinary.  None of them looked particularly strong or malicious.
However…
‘I'm no different.’
Who would imagine, looking at Yi Han-su’s face, that he was an optimist who could laugh even when his head was smashed with a hammer or his limbs were torn apart and bloody?
The same goes for them.
None of them would have ever escaped this place without blood on their hands.
Those who did were all dead long ago.
“Uhm…  I’m a bit… No, honestly… a little uncomfortable with this… Ah… It’s not that I’m angry…  “
The Goblin hesitantly spoke, and Auril Gaviss promptly replied. 
“Hmm, you must’ve been curious, too, right?  What kind of people were those who you’ve been conversing with behind masks all this time?  It’s our last meeting, so I thought it’d be nice for everyone to show each other their faces.”
“Ah…  Yes, yes?”
The Goblin nodded awkwardly and then glanced at me. 
I knew what he was trying to say.
“But…  why is Lion…?”
“He wants to know why you didn’t take off your mask, right?”
“Yes…  that’s right.”
Auril Gaviss removed everyone’s masks without asking for consent, except for mine.
So why was I an exception?
“Ha-ha, I’m a bit hesitant to treat that friend the same way!  You never know what might happen if I treat him disrespectfully.”
“Ah…  yes, yes?”
The Goblin nodded awkwardly again.
I found it slightly amusing.
Why bother asking if he’s just going to agree to a response like that?
Well, that’s just the Goblin for you.
“…”
“…”
An awkward silence filled the room.
Auril Gaviss enjoyed the situation, without saying a word, and the members kept glancing at me.
They seemed to want me to do something, so I was forced to speak first.
“So…  is that all?”
A hint of urgency, urging him to get on with it if he had more to say.
I used an indirect approach, as it wasn’t really my style, but luckily it seemed to get the point across.
“No. I still have one thing to say.”
“One thing?”
“I have a question for you.”
“Oh, really? Ask away.”
I readily agreed.
My plan was to listen to the question first, and then decide whether to answer or not.
But…
“There are too many people listening to ask a question.”
Auril Gaviss surveyed the surroundings with a sly voice.
“But it’d be a bit rude to just kick you all out.  You were forced to reveal your faces, so there should be some kind of compensation, shouldn’t there?”
My body tensed at the word ‘compensation’.
This old man wouldn’t be offering any real compensation.
He’s definitely up to something…
“Just giving compensation would be boring, so let’s play a game together.”
Sure enough, he started talking in circles.
“Game…  you say?”
“Yes, a game. You all like games, don’t you?  By the way, the reward is going to go to only one person, the winner of the game.”
“…Can we know what the reward is?”
The Goblin, without even hearing about the game itself, wanted to know the reward first, and Auril Gaviss, without resorting to the usual ‘you’ll know later’ tactics, gave a cool response. 
“I’ll send you home.”
Everyone’s eyes changed.
