## Chapter 707: The Call to Arms (2)
Kaislan’s words left me deep in thought. It wasn’t surprising, considering I’d be dragged to the military headquarters the moment we appeared publicly. My clan would be left to face the dangerous frontlines alone without me.
“Should we just stay hidden down here?”
The memory of losing three comrades still haunted me.  The mere idea of being separated from my clan felt unbearably unsettling.  But…
“You have to go, Captain.” Kaislan’s voice held a note of persuasion, as if he understood my internal struggle.
“Have to, you say?”
“The official document suggests the call to arms was issued only recently. The deadline hasn’t passed yet, so it shouldn’t be an issue, but failing to respond after the deadline could cause major problems.”
“For instance?”
My gaze demanded a detailed explanation. Kaislan hesitated before speaking.
“First, it would severely tarnish your reputation, Captain. No matter our circumstances, it would be seen as desertion.  It’d appear as if you fled out of fear of war.”
Essentially, my reputation as Baron Bjorn Yandel would plummet to the depths of the abyss… 
I’d always benefited from my reputation, so I was aware of its value. However…
“That doesn’t matter to me. Next.”
Kaislan was momentarily stunned by my unhesitant answer before a wry smile broke across his face.
“Such a typical Captain response.”
“Anyway, get on with it. Next.”
“…Secondly, it would harm the clan itself. As I said, it would be seen as desertion, so we would all face trial after the war. We’d likely receive severe punishment. Desertion is a grave offense under military law.”
“Severe punishment, you say?  What exactly does that entail?”
“Execution, Captain.  Military law prioritizes deterrence as its primary objective.”
This was not a matter to be dismissed lightly. 
If I didn’t want all these people to spend their lives in hiding beneath the sewers…
“What if… Noirarc wins? Then there would be no punishment for desertion, wouldn’t there?”
“True, but…”
Kaislan looked at me resolutely, addressing my hypothetical question.
“The royal family will not be defeated.”
“How can you be so certain? The call to arms itself implies the royal family is desperate, to the point where they need to rely on adventurers?”
“Well… they might be seeking assistance to minimize their own losses, but I don’t think they’re truly cornered.”
Kaislan insisted that it was merely his personal opinion, but I couldn’t dismiss it entirely. He’d served in the military, after all.
He must know more about the royal family’s power than anyone else.
“Anything else?”
“Thirdly, it’s you, Captain.”
“Me?”
“Yes.  We wouldn’t go as far as ‘execution’ like us, but in the worst-case scenario, they could use ‘desertion’ as a pretext to revoke your title.”
He was staring at me with such serious intensity, I couldn’t help but feel apprehensive.
“Revoking my title…?”
Honestly, I didn’t care about losing my title.
The real problem was the clan. 
If I still held my title, I could at least try to prevent their ‘execution’. 
“Don’t worry, I can speak on your behalf, Captain.”
When I nodded in agreement, Kaislan looked at me with a soldier’s gaze.
“We chose to follow you, not because we wanted to be your children.”
“…”
“We simply wanted to walk the same path as you.”
As soon as Kaislan finished, the others nodded in agreement, as if they were all thinking the same thing.
“You’re finally saying what we all wanted to hear.”
Amelia looked as if she’d just had a refreshing drink.
“You must go, Captain. The royal family will never fall. If you want to live in this world, you must go, even now.”
In that situation, I had no choice but to finally nod in agreement.
“I understand. I will go. But I need to do something first.”
“What is it?”
Well, of course.
What else could it be? We would have to part ways if I left, right?
“I’m going to choose a deputy captain.”
We needed someone to lead the group while I was gone.
***
The position of deputy captain had remained vacant since the clan was founded. It wasn’t intentional; I’d wanted to fill it long ago, but…
“Somehow, we’re only doing it now.”
There were many reasons for the delay.
Everyone had found the position burdensome from the start. 
The clan was functioning smoothly, with each member handling their own area of expertise, and we’d preferred a more horizontal atmosphere among the members.
But things were different now.
“Deputy Captain, you say?”
“Yes.”
There’s a saying in the world.
A pack of lions led by a sheep is stronger than a pack of sheep led by a lion.
Leadership is crucial.
Therefore…
“Is there anyone who wishes to be nominated?”
I discreetly asked the members, but no one immediately stepped forward.
Kaislan seemed a bit eager, though…
“Those two are surprising.”
Bercil Goulond and James Kala, both former deputy captains of large clans.
They seemed completely uninterested, even though they were arguably the most suitable candidates. 
“Maybe they’ve experienced the burden of the position and understand its weight?”
It wasn’t hard to understand their hesitation.
Our clan was different from the others.
Being the deputy captain meant more ‘obligation’ than any benefit, like power.
“Hmm… who would be the right person?”
With that in mind, I scrutinized each member standing nearby.
Who would be the most suitable for the position of deputy captain?
I wasn’t sure yet, but one thing was certain.
The position of deputy captain wasn’t something I could simply bestow upon someone.
What if I appointed Auyen as deputy captain? Would the others listen to him?
We needed someone who could establish their authority within the clan through their own merits.
And in that regard…
Meland Kaislan.
He met the minimum requirements, at least.
He had experience leading a group, and as a former soldier, he had some charisma… 
“Above all, he’s skilled in strategy and tactics.”
His weaknesses were his lack of information-gathering ability and his tendency to be passive due to his unwavering convictions.
In simpler terms, he wasn’t quick on his feet…
“Amelia Rainweils.”
Amelia was the complete opposite of Kaislan.
She was always rational in her thinking and judgment. Having experienced a wide range of situations, she was also quick on her feet.
However, her understanding of the group was less developed than Kaislan’s. 
She wasn’t lacking in charisma, but she preferred to work alone…
“As an original member, I think everyone would accept her as deputy captain.”
This was a huge advantage.
We’d be separated soon, and she was someone everyone would accept without question.
“Bercil Goulond.”
…She’s a good candidate too.
She joined us soon after the Ice Rock expedition, so she’s been with the clan for a while, and she has experience as a former deputy captain.
“Well, she might lack charisma compared to the other two…?”
She’s been a regular member for so long, but she would act differently if she were deputy captain.
“Her strategy and tactics are pretty good too… from her conversations, she’s not as stubborn or inflexible as I thought…?”
Looking at it from this perspective, Bercil seemed like a combination of Amelia and Kaislan.
A perfect middle ground, you could say.
“Anyway, there’s no one else who stands out.”
After scanning the remaining members, I narrowed down the candidates to these three.
After all, Erwen and Misha were original members, but they didn’t have the potential to lead others.
“Hey, Deputy Captain! Maybe… I could do it?!”
Ainar, of course.
“You stay out of this.”
“Why! You said anyone who wants to can step forward!”
“…You’re out.”
“That’s unfair! Bjorn!! How can you treat me so disrespectfully—.”
“Frenel, the Captain is talking. Be quiet.”
Amelia narrowed her eyes at Ainar, who instantly quieted down.
“…”
Well, seeing this, Amelia seems perfect…
“Let me be clear, I have no intention of doing it.”
“…What?”
“It just wouldn’t suit me.”
Well, that’s your opinion, but…
She seems to have a habit of downplaying herself.
She never wears skirts or bright clothes, similar to Erwen or Misha.
Is she always convinced that things won’t suit her? 
Even without trying them on.
“But don’t worry.  Whoever becomes deputy captain, I’ll help them as much as I’ve helped you.”
Still, it would be unfair to force her to take the position after she’s said that.
Amelia as deputy captain is a plan I’ll have to abandon completely.
“Since there’s no one else to nominate, I’ll choose—.”
“Me! I said I’d… Aah! Why, why are you pinching me!”
Misha pinched Ainar’s waist, cutting her off once again and putting an end to Ainar’s persistent attempt.
“Since there’s no one else to nominate, I’ll choose. Meland Kaislan, and Bercil Goulond. I think you two would be ideal for the position of deputy captain.”
“If you entrust me with the responsibility, I will not shirk its weight.”
“Me too… someone has to do it, after all.”
Okay, so these two are officially nominated.
The only step left is to choose between them.
I was going to assign it to the remaining candidate if one of them declined, but both expressed their willingness to take on the position.
“I’m starting the vote now. All members will come to me and whisper their choice.  Who do you think is more suitable for deputy captain.”
“Whisper…?  Is that right?”
“Don’t worry! It’s a secret ballot!”
“…”
James Kala seemed a bit dumbfounded but didn’t raise any further objections.
Then…
“Let’s begin!”
The barbarian-style secret ballot began.
The first to step forward was Erwen, whom I’d pointed to.
“Amelia Rainweils.”
…What?
Did I hear wrong?
“Just… I think she’d be the best.”
“But you need to choose one of the two…?”
“Then just count it as a blank vote. I don’t care who it is.”
“I understand.”
A blank vote (Amelia) for the first.
“I’ll vote for Goulond… she seems a bit nicer than Kaislan…?”
Misha chose Bercil, second.
…How does being nice relate to being deputy captain?
“What is this, an elementary school election for class representative?”
I was starting to wonder if this was really a vote, but the subsequent votes were a bit better.
“Bercil Goulond.”
Amelia, only speaking that one sentence before going back.
“I’d like to cast my vote for Ms. Goulond.”
James Kala, the former deputy captain.
“If I had to trust my life to one of them, I’d choose Ms. Goulond.”
Sven Parav, a man with extraordinary survival instincts.
“I’ll vote for Bercil Goulond.”
Lilys Marone, who had been quiet, cast one vote each for Bercil, making it a total of five votes for her.
“I’m going for Kaislan! A knight is better than a mage!”
“Hey, you can hear all of this!”
Ainar, seemingly clueless about secret ballots, cast one vote for Kaislan, giving him his first vote…
“Then the outcome’s already decided.”
The nominees were going to abstain from voting, so the ballot was practically over.
But I still wanted to hear their opinions, so I called the last member to vote.
“I, I…?”
Auyen Rocklob, the former pirate.
Who would he choose?
“I… I think it has to be the lady.”
That was an unexpected response.
“The lady…?”
“Ah, no… I mean Ms. Rains. I can’t think of anyone more suitable for the position of deputy captain than her…?”
Oh, dear…
“I understand, go back.”
“Yes… I’m sorry for saying such a silly thing.”
“No, it’s your right to express your opinion.”
Anyway, with Auyen completing his vote and returning to his seat, the deputy captain election concluded.
“…”
“…”
Kaislan and Bercil looked tense.
The other members were also curious about the results.
“Don’t worry, Kaislan! Everyone voted for you! A knight is better than a mage! Of course, you’re going to win!”
“Ha-ha, don’t inflate my ego too much. Ms. Goulond is a very capable person. We won’t know until the results are in.”
Well… seeing him act like this makes me reluctant to announce the results.
Not that I’m going to back out.
“I’m going to announce the results. Bercil Goulond received five votes and has been appointed as deputy captain of our Anabada Clan starting today.”
As soon as I announced the winner, Kaislan looked a bit disappointed yet relieved.
“If Ms. Goulond received five votes, then I must have received three. This difference isn’t all that disappointin—.”
“Emily Rains received two votes, Meland Kaislan one vote. And that’s it.”
The results were just as clear as the expression on Kaislan’s face a moment ago.
Kaislan was taken aback, taking a long pause before reacting.
“………What? What are you talking about?”
“Literally, though?”
I shrugged nonchalantly, and Kaislan shouted as if I’d said something absurd.
“But Ms. Rains didn’t even participate in the deputy captain race!”
Yeah, that’s true.
I was thinking about whether I should just keep this to myself.
But that would taint the fairness of our sacred secret ballot, right?
“Don’t worry. The votes for Ms. Rains were all counted as abstentions.”
So cheer up.
“Kaislan, you’re still in second place.”
