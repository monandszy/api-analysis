## Chapter 539: Verdant Glaive (1)
Three days after the second rainy season ended.  Counting from the day we entered the Labyrinth, it was the 74th day.
“About 1 billion stones from the island… and I’ve been saving up about 600 million…”
That’s a total of 1.6 billion stones.
Of course, this money was collected by dozens of people, and my share would be much smaller after the distribution. But…
Fortunately, we’ve reached an agreement with all the members.
So, there’s only one thing left.
“Take a good rest, everyone! We’re not doing anything today!”
Having spent the last few days mining stones across the giant island, I led the team back to the cave.
The cave, of course, was the one where the Hext Clan had found the portal stone after getting stranded.
“Thinking about it now, we were really lucky.”
Currently, the mapping of the giant island was almost complete. There weren’t many places that qualified as caves. But this cave, nestled deep within the island, was unique, and somehow monsters never seemed to approach it.
It was practically the safest place on the island…
To find this place in that desperate situation.
“I wish a little of that luck would rub off on me.”
My next action was heavily reliant on luck, and the psychological pressure was immense. I wasn’t exactly known for my good fortune.
Or maybe…
“My luck is average.”
I’d only started thinking that recently.
Since childhood, I’d encountered countless misfortunes and believed I was cursed from birth. But looking back, I hadn’t been so unlucky after all.
I survived all those hardships.
And most importantly…
“Are you finally going to start?”
“Bjorn! I don’t know what you’re doing, but good luck!”
Meeting these amazing people was already a stroke of unbelievable luck.
Erwen, who became my night companion on the first expedition.
Ainar, my trustworthy warrior of the same bloodline.
Raven and Hikurod, my comrades we found in the bloodstained stronghold where the deformed monsters appeared.
Misha, Rothmiller, and Dwaki of the Half-hearted team.
There was a time when I had nothing.
Meeting them was truly magical, a stroke of unbelievable luck.
Therefore…
“Don’t rely on them.”
Ainar, Misha, and the others.
I discarded the weak desire to put the responsibility on my lucky comrades.
And…
“I am a lucky person.”
I repeated it over and over in my mind.
What I needed now wasn’t doubt but unshakeable certainty.
“I am…”
A lucky person.
Just as I repeated it one more time.
“I am…”
Something flashed through my mind.
My jaw muscles, tense as if slightly startled, relaxed, and the subtle tremor in my hand vanished.
It was a revelation.
A half-empty cup of water.
Whether it was considered fortunate or unfortunate was not for the observer to decide.
Only oneself could make that judgment.
“Lucky.”
“…Huh?”
“What are you saying? You haven’t even done anything…”
Haven’t done anything?
Everything in this world is up to the mind.
It’s the same principle as how the future written on the records will inevitably come to pass.
In other words, the moment I set my mind on something, the future is already set.
That is the truth of the world, an unbreakable law.
“Heh heh…”
But I simply laughed and remained silent, knowing that the foolish beings wouldn’t understand even if I explained it.
“The wind is refreshing today.”
A sensation as if the power of the universe, transcending nature itself, enveloped me in warmth.
“And the sunlight is cozy.”
The only thing that remained in my heart was certainty, unwavering certainty.
“We’re inside the cave. Where is this wind you speak of?”
“Maybe he just wanted to say it was refreshing?”
“That might be true, but saying the sunlight is cozy…?”
“Uncle… are you feeling alright?”
Ignoring the clueless questions of mortals, I picked up one of the scattered stones.
I slowly brought it to my necklace.
There was no reason to rush.
“Water is water, and wind is wind.”
It was that simple for me.
Whoosh—!
The future is already set.
“The power of the great alchemist Garpas detects the power of creation.”
“Creating a Stone Bread.”
Let’s go.
***
No.7777, Garpas’ Necklace.
The effect of this necklace is simple.
When a stone is placed on the necklace, it melts and disappears, randomly spitting out items like bread, water, metal, and so on.
Like this.
“Creating a Stone Bread.”
Each time a stone is placed, the item displayed in the necklace’s gem changes. You can take out whatever you want at that moment.
I had no reason to choose Stone Bread, so I kept turning it. But…
“Why doesn’t the item change?”
What’s going on?
“Creating a Stone Bread.”
“Creating a Stone Bread.”
“Creating a Stone Bread.”
“Creating a St…”.
Six Stone Breads in a row from the start?
I was using 5th grade or higher stones, not 9th grade.
“The chance of getting Stone Bread with 5th grade or higher stones is about 4%.”
And the probability of that happening six times in a row…
“…Ugh!”
My mind almost snapped out of the Barbarian’s Clear Mind mode, but I managed to overcome it with my practiced mind control.
The early gacha was just for stacking.
“Bjorn! Are you alright? You’re coughing!”
“…Move. I’m fine.”
…Doubt is poison.
A very nasty poison that gnaws at the mind and makes life miserable.
So…
“Creating a Stone Bread.”
“Creating a Stone Bread.”
“Creating a Stone Bread.”
I repeated the action, placing stones on the necklace, mechanically, without a human mind.
Nine Stone Breads in a row, after six?
What did it matter?
The outcome was predetermined.
“Creating a Steel Ingot.”
Yes, probability is just probability.
What should come will eventually come.
The only thing I needed was that belief.
“Oh! Bjorn’s expression changed!”
“I’ve heard about this! When the Baron makes that face, it means he’s serious about something!”
No matter what appeared, I kept placing stones, maintaining my composure.
How long had it been?
“I think it’s about time…”.
That thought was just beginning to form when…
“Creating a Steel Short Sword.”
The necklace, which had been spitting out miscellaneous items like bread, metal, and bricks, finally produced a decent piece of equipment.
I wasn’t surprised. Garpas’ Necklace had a hidden pattern.
“Seven thousand seven hundred seventy-seven 9th grade stones.”
That would be about 1.55 million stones in cash.
If you placed that many stones, the necklace would definitely produce a ‘usable item’, chosen randomly.
And…
“Creating a Lythinum Chestplate.”
This pattern repeated every 1.55 million stones.
Wow, so I got a Lythinum Chestplate after placing 3.1 million?
“Not bad for the start.”
Of course, that was just a feeling.
The result was meaningless to me.
There was no way I was stopping here.
“What? Bjorn! Why are you just skipping it? It’s not Stone Bread! You’re wasting it!”
Because if I stop, I have to start stacking all over again.
I wanted to quickly answer, thinking he’d keep bothering me, but thankfully, Amelia handled it right away.
“Prnellin, leave him be. Don’t bother him.”
“Oh, no… I was just curious about why…”.
“Tsk.”
“Oh, alright… I won’t bother him anymore…”.
That’s why order is important, isn’t it?
Since that time in the hut when she beat the crap out of him, Ainar had been unusually weak against Amelia.
Anyway, that’s not important.
“Creating a Redwood Longbow.”
A longbow made with 2nd grade wood.
“Creating a Steel Shield.”
Then came a common shield, much lower in value.
Soon, I had pulled nine usable items, and it was almost time for the tenth pull.
Or rather…
Fifteen million five hundred fifty thousand stones in cash.
Seven hundred seventy-seven thousand seven hundred seventy-seven 9th grade stones.
At the moment I had poured all of that into the necklace…
“Creating a No.9981, Wanderer’s Vitality Ring.”
For the first time, a numbered item appeared.
Of course, it wasn’t more profitable than the previous pulls, financially. Not all numbered items are expensive.
“This one was about 2 million stones, right?”
In a way, it was even less valuable than the Lythinum Chestplate.
But it was also meaningless.
“Creating a Cloud Candy.”
“Creating a Training Magic Staff.”
“Creating High Density Magic Herb.”
“Creating Wyvern Leather Armor.”
“Creating a Permanent Magic Enhancement (Light Sphere) Sc…”.
Potions, equipment, enhanced materials, and so on.
I was just skimming, placing stones into the bottomless pit, when…
“…Huh?”
My body froze.
The reason was very simple.
“Creating a Mystium Ingot.”
Crazy! A 6th grade metal here?
The scroll I pulled just before… it must have been just normal gacha probability.
“M, Mystium!”
“I, isn’t that ingot worth hundreds of millions of stones?”
If I stopped here, I could get tens of millions of stones.
But…
“Damn it.”
I had to stack misfortune, but why was it popping up so early?
I sighed inwardly, but I pushed aside the doubt.
I continued to place the stones.
“…Ah!”
“…Huh!”
Someone sighed around me.
Damn, I’m bringing bad luck to the gacha player.
“How can a mere mortal understand the mind of a giant?”
How long had I been pushing forward alone like a rhinoceros’ horn?
Whooooosh—!
Fifteen million five hundred thousand stones in cash.
Seventy-seven million seven hundred seventy-seven thousand seven hundred seventy-seven 9th grade stones.
At the moment I had poured all of that into the necklace…
For the first time, red light burst forth from the necklace.
“The power of Garpas has been greatly damaged by the over-concentration of magical energy.”
In other words, this would be the last gacha. I wouldn’t be able to do it again.
“Bjorn… are you alright? I think your necklace even has a crack…”.
Of course, I wasn’t alright.
I hadn’t even considered a retreat.
And in that sense…
“Let’s see.”
I checked the gem after the red light subsided.
Statistically, single numbered items could be pulled from here. If I had gotten something good, I was willing to take profits and stop —.
“Creating a No.535, Polar Regions Shield.”
Polar regions shield.
That was the name in the game, and it was the shield I used when I leveled up a shield Barbarian, until I got a graduation shield.
“Damn.”
It wasn’t bad to get a shield, but a triple numbered item?
“Who am I supposed to give this to?”
Although it was the most valuable item I’d pulled, no one around me seemed disappointed.
They must not have recognized it.
Only weirdos memorize all the numbered items.
“Next.”
I placed another stone.
I took a quick glance and checked the item.
“Next.”
I kept refreshing the items.
As the number of pulls increased exponentially, the high-value items began to appear repeatedly.
A few memorable ones were…
“Creating a No.2998, Guardian Regiment Insignia.”
My earring.
“Creating a Staff with the Power of the World Tree.”
The staff made with the World Tree, a 6th grade material, that Bersil coveted.
“Creating five Arch Ingots.”
The 6th grade ingot, Arch, with the maximum quantity.
“Creating a Shrine.”
A potion obtainable with a certain probability in the 9th floor rift.
“Creating a No.7777, Garpas’ Necklace.”
I have no idea what to do with it.
Is it like a Matryoshka doll?
In any case, countless items appeared, and I passed on them all.
And as a result…
“Creating a Stone Bread.”
I’d finally reached my destination.
I’d placed so many stones that I couldn’t remember the exact number, but I had a feeling.
“About ten more.”
I just needed to place ten more stones to reach my target.
“Creating a Stone Bread.”
Fifteen million five hundred thousand stones in cash.
“Creating a Stone Bread.”
Seventy-seven million seven hundred seventy-seven thousand seven hundred seventy-seven 9th grade stones.
Hm…
“Creating a Stone Bread.”
What?
“Creating a Stone Bread.”
Wait…
“Creating a Stone Bread.”
“Creating a Stone Bread.”
“Creating a St…”
Nine Stone Breads in a row at the end?
Of course, it didn’t matter if it was Stone Bread or a Steel Ingot…
Gulp.
My hand stopped without my noticing.
Cold sweat covered my palm.
Revelation.
This phenomenon felt like a revelation.
A universal revelation about my future.
“…What am I talking about.”
I shook my head, desperately clinging to my sanity.
This phenomenon was just a phenomenon. Attaching meaning to it was foolish.
Moreover.
“This is actually good.”
In a way, it was a positive sign.
I don’t believe in superstitions, but I’ve often reinforced useless equipment in games, only to destroy it and then strengthen my real equipment.
So…
Swish.
I placed another stone with unwavering faith.
Whooooosh—!
The stone shattered into tiny pieces, and the necklace emitted light.
A blindingly bright light.
“The maximum number of stones has been absorbed.”
“Caution. The necklace may break at any time.”
This is where the real luck battle begins.
***
Seventy-seven million seven hundred seventy-seven thousand seven hundred seventy-seven stones.
After absorbing that many stones, Garpas’ Necklace transforms into a fixed-type gacha.
You could say it has a ceiling, right?
From No.1 to No.35.
From now on, this necklace will definitely produce a top-ranked numbered item within that range.
So, how will my first attempt turn out?
‘Tsk.’
It doesn’t come easy.
“Creating a No.35, Abyss Claw.”
Of course, the Abyss Claw was a great item.
It’s a claw-shaped weapon, given as a set of two, and its effects are varied.  If I gave this to Amelia, she would use it very effectively.
But…
“Fifteen million, and I get a No.35?”
It just doesn’t feel worth it.
So…
“One more.”
I placed another stone on the necklace, which had already reached its maximum capacity —.
“Creating a No.35, Abyss Claw.”
What?
Why isn’t it changing?
I definitely placed a stone…
“…Is this real?”
My heart felt uncertain, but my head calmly acknowledged the situation.
I had gotten the Abyss Claw again.
Thump thump thump thump—
Suddenly, my head filled with blood, and my vision narrowed.
I felt a chill down my spine and my lips went dry.
Swish.
I slowly picked up another stone.
“Caution. The necklace may break at any time.”
There’s a warning message, but I wasn’t really scared. I know it won’t break for three more pulls.
…Don’t worry.
This is all just stacking.
My future is a bright rainbow —.
“Creating a No.35, Abyss Claw.”
“…One more.”
“Creating a No.35, Abyss Claw.”
“Damn it, are you kidding me?”
I couldn’t hold it back anymore and cursed out loud.
I tried to maintain my composure, but I couldn’t take it anymore.
All sorts of thoughts swirled in my mind.
Everything I experienced today felt meaningful.
The continuous Stone Breads…
“Garpas’ Necklace.”
And the item that popped up when I rerolled.
Maybe it was a revelation after all?
A message that today is ruined, but I should take this and go back and try again next time.
“…Yandel, are you alright?”
“Ah… yeah. I’m fine.”
“Your face is as white as a sheet…”.
“…That’s impossible. I am lucky.”
I forced myself to regain my composure.
“Four Abyss Claws in a row?”
It’s just another hurdle.
Sweet fruits are always hidden beyond trials.
“Trust myself.”
I recalled the revelation I had earlier, and with a confident gesture, I placed another stone.
“Creating a No.35, Abyss Claw.”
It’s still okay.
It didn’t break, did it?
“Creating a No.35, Abyss Claw.”
Well, it didn’t break, maybe it’s just the universe playing a trick on me —.
“Creating a No.35, Abyss Claw.”
…Is it broken?
“Creating a No.35, Abyss Claw.”
…I think it’s getting dangerous now.
Thump thump thump thump—
My heart raced wildly.
“Creating a No.35, Abyss Claw.”
Finally, I raised the white flag.
“…Ah, Ainar?”
Ainar Prnellin.
She’s a warrior who seems to live carefree, but always has good luck, and things always go her way.
“Huh? What’s up?”
Ainar, who had lost interest and was munching on jerky far away, tilted her head at me.
I politely called her over.
“Um…”.
“Huh?”
“C, come here… and try placing a stone on this.”
“Oh! Really? I was actually curious about it!”
Thankfully, Ainar readily agreed to my request and came running over.
And…
“Creating a No.3, Aegis Wall.”
That day, I learned a new lesson.
“…Oh? It’s a shield. Is it good?”
“…”.
I should just ask her to do this from now on.
