## The Storm's Eye (4)
We chewed on jerky, moving forward. Not just me, but all the members of the expedition. 
"I… I think I'm going to puke. I ate too much, I can't…"
Some grumbled, their bellies full, but they were a minority. Even as we climbed the uphill path at a near-alarming pace, everyone forced down the jerky.
We all knew. This was our last chance to eat our fill.
"Schuitz! No, I mean… Yandell Viscount!"
As we walked, Marone, the mage of the 5th team, ran towards me.
"The detection magic I set up 10 minutes ago triggered!"
"They're much closer than we thought."
Close enough to reach within a few minutes if we ran at full speed. 
"Everyone, throw away your food crates!"
I shouted, and tossed my own jerky crate over the cliff. We needed to lighten our load to increase our speed.
Whizz!
Most members threw away their crates as soon as the command was given, but a few hesitated, their eyes filled with reluctance. They were the ones who filled the roles of knights and paladins, the warriors of the expedition.
"Damn it, I could still eat more!"
It was funny to hear this from someone whose pockets were stuffed with jerky, but I understood. I felt the same way.
'Why does my stomach feel empty already?'
This inefficient body of mine could never get enough, no matter how much I ate. Damn it.
'Well, the good times are over.'
"Marone, reset the detection magic. We need to deduce their speed from the intervals."
"Yes!"
Marone immediately reset the magic as we increased our pace. Not dramatically, but from a brisk walk to a near-marathon pace.
Seven minutes later.
"The detection magic triggered!"
They had closed the distance by another three minutes, despite our increased speed.
"This is getting troublesome."
The non-combatants like priests and mages were already being carried. We had only one option left.
Survival depended on what you could sacrifice.
"All of you, throw away the backpacks with the heating stones."
We had to give up the stones, crucial for maintaining our body temperature.  They were the heaviest things left, after the tents and sleeping bags we threw away when we abandoned the sleds.  As for food, we'd naturally consume it as we went.
"Damn it, now we have to fight the cold too?"
"What are you all waiting for! Hurry and get rid of them!"
"We'll be running anyway. Don't be so sentimental about them."
As expected, our speed increased further after we sacrificed the heating stones. The members who had to carry the non-combatants felt a significant relief.
Soon, good news came.
"The detection magic triggered. This time, exactly 7 minutes and 37 seconds!"
The distance that had been closing started to hold steady. Not that we weren't dying from exhaustion, but…
'They won't be having an easy time either.'
From now on, it was a test of endurance. The harsh environment was fair to everyone. Just as we had to sacrifice much, they would also have to make choices soon, just like this.
"…What should we do? They're getting faster! Now, there's only a six-minute difference!"
We ran for five hours straight, chewing on jerky, not even taking a moment to rest. The seven-minute barrier that we had maintained was broken.
What was the reason?
The answer was simple.
"I briefly shifted into mental connection and checked. Their numbers have decreased! About twelve of them are missing!"
They had given up. They abandoned the huge advantage they had in numbers to catch us.
'Did they hand over all their food and send the rest back?'
That was the most likely scenario. Those who turned back might starve, but they could eat their fill once they reached the bottom.
'Twelve… so now they're outnumbered.'
For now, we had twice the number of enemies. But…
'I'm still not sure if we can win.'
We would eventually have to face them. But not yet.
So…
"What should we do? They'll catch up soon!"
What else? They sacrificed something, so we should too.  It's only fair.
"Throw away any heavy armor equipment.  We need to be able to fight, so shields and weapons are exempt."
"Are you serious?"
I threw away my armor without a second thought.
"Did you forget you were yelling about everyone dying a while ago? Do you think it's precious now?"
"No, I, I just…."
"Then good. Throw it away. We'll get reimbursed for the equipment anyway when we return to the city and organize the loot."
"Wow… abandoning our armor while we're being chased. You're truly insane."
The frontliners, who considered their armor their life, grumbled. But they eventually obeyed my order, throwing away their armor and only wearing their thick fur coats.
The result?
"Six minutes! It's the same as before!"
The six-minute gap remained unchanged. 
They must be panicking right now, I imagined. What's going on? Why isn't the gap closing?
'I wonder what their faces will be when they encounter us, stripped down to our underwear.'
Good. It feels like I've got a little more strength now.
Thump, thump.
How much further did we run up the hill?
"…I never knew people could sleep while running."
"Even just a minute… I just want to sleep for a minute."
Our speed gradually slowed. It was only natural, considering the relentless march, with no proper rest, let alone sleep, for days.
But…
"Six minutes... six minutes..."
The distance between us and the enemies remained the same. They were losing their stamina as much as we were, but…
Then, something changed.
"What's going on? The detection magic should have triggered by now."
The detection magic, which had triggered every six minutes, hadn't activated in over twenty minutes.
Why?
Could they have found a way to evade the magic?
'No. If they could do that, they would have done it earlier.'
I continued running for over ten minutes, but the detection magic remained silent.
That's when I reached my conclusion.
'They must be reaching their limit.'
They've stopped to rest.
In other words…
"Halt!"
We could also rest.
***
"Everyone, rest! You can even sleep! I'll wake you up when it's time to leave!"
The moment my order came out, the members collapsed without even a cheer. Several of them, exhausted beyond measure, fell asleep the moment they hit the ground, as if they were unconscious.
"You're not resting?"
"Just checking the surroundings."
"I'm sorry, I want to stay with you, but I can't hold it in anymore…"
"Don't worry, just go rest."
"Yes…"
With a tired face, Erwen turned and huddled next to Amelia, who she normally didn't get along with, and fell asleep.
Well, without the heating stones, they'll have to share body heat.
Chuckling, I watched them for a while before taking a walk around the area.
Among the members who were eating or sleeping, there was one whose actions stood out.
"Kaislan, what are you writing?"
"Ah! I'm writing down what Schuitz... no, Yandell, you said."
"What I said…?"
Kaislan didn't answer. He simply handed me his notepad.
[I'll bear the burden.  Even the dirty work, the work no one wants, I'll do it.]
[I'll be the first to walk into the stench of blood, and I'll be the one hurt, if anyone must be.]
[So... follow me.]
[If you're going to throw away your life anyway, throw it away with me!!]
Ugh, reading this in writing is making me blush.
But I couldn't say anything bad to him, not while he was diligently writing this down, even while foregoing sleep.
"Your memory is good."
"I don't know, what use is memory? I probably won't ever forget it."
What a peculiar hobby.
Embarrassed, I tried to scold him, asking why he was writing all this down and what he planned to do with it. But Kaislan just shrugged and smiled silently.
"You never know."
"Huh?"
"This record might become a moment in a great history."
Ugh, his history obsession.
He’s always been like that, hasn't he?
I straightened up and patted his shoulder.
"We have to survive. For this record to make history."
"Ah, yes, yes. That's right, we have to survive…"
"Write enough and get some rest. You can do that later."
"Yes, sir."
I finished talking with Kaislan and headed towards Erwen. A woman mage, sitting with her back against her backpack, opened her eyes.
"Bjorn Yandell."
It was Bersil Goulond.
"Ah, did I wake you? I’m sorry—"
"I'm the one who needs to apologize."
" …Huh?"
"I'm sorry. For leaving you all behind on the first floor."
I had no idea what she was talking about.  Why was she bringing this up now?
"Do you remember when I said I sincerely regretted it at the banquet? I wasn't just saying it.  After I woke up and heard about what you did in the Crystal Cave, I felt so ashamed and miserable."
"What's there to be ashamed of? It was the right decision, if you were a leader. I would have done the same."
Bersil Goulond's face hardened at my genuine response.
"Don't joke. You wouldn't have."
That was too much to take. If they had given me enough escape tickets for everyone at the Crystal Cave, I would have immediately jumped through the portal.
I simply struggled to survive because I was abandoned. There was no heroic mission.
But perhaps she thought differently.
"You're like the eye of a storm. No matter how harsh the wind blows from all sides, you never get swept away."
Barbarians aren't the ones who understand complex figures of speech.
As I stared at her blankly, wondering if she was testing me, Bersil Goulond laughed wryly.
"Maybe that's why people gather around you, even in the midst of a fierce storm."
"It's just… the situation turned out that way."
"Maybe I said something wrong. I didn't mean to burden you.  Were… you resting? I'm sorry for interrupting you."
"No, you go rest too."
And so, my conversation with Bersil ended.
I moved past the collapsed members and lay down near Erwen. If the detection magic triggered, the mage would wake me up, so I planned to close my eyes for a moment.
But…
'The eye of the storm…'
It was an inappropriate compliment, even when I thought about it again.
Unless she meant that I was cursed with bad luck and everyone around me suffers because of it—
"Sir! Wake up!"
What? 
It felt like I had only closed my eyes for a few seconds.
"Did the detection magic trigger?"
"No, it didn't…"
Then why did she wake me up so urgently? 
The answer was right before my eyes, even before I could ask Erwen.
"What the hell! Why are there monsters here!"
"Wait, these aren't the ones we saw before!"
"Skeletons… are there skeletons here too?"
Countless monsters were crawling up the cliff.
The members, their faces still drowsy, scrambled to their feet and grabbed their weapons.
"Yandell, do you know anything about this phenomenon?"
Amelia's question made me clench my fists.
Do I know?
Of course I do.
There's only one reason why monsters respawn in the Ice Cave after it's been cleared.
[The Ice Mage, Kariades, has appeared in this area.]
A boss monster with a spawn rate of less than 10%. And it had to spawn now.
'Damn RNG.'
Are they trying to tell us to go out and die?
Why does this have to spawn now?
Suddenly, my vision went dark and I let out a sigh. But I checked the time first.
[00:12]
It was just after midnight.  In other words, we were only a day's distance away from escaping the Ice Cave.
"Yandell Viscount! The, the detection magic triggered too!"
The enemies had finished their rest and resumed their pursuit, marching through the mountains.
Was that why?
I couldn't help but laugh.
"Heh heh heh."
A warrior's intuition told me. Today was going to be a hard day.
