## Chapter 386: We (5)
Baron Björn Jandel. The Duke's eyes, even when uttering that name, held no trace of trepidation. If Erwin or Amelia had looked at me with such unwavering conviction, I would have confessed my wrongdoings before being reprimanded further. 
But... the Duke and those two were different. It would be naive to blindly trust the gaze of a seasoned politician who had weathered countless storms and held the second most powerful position in the kingdom for decades.
"Your Grace, are you perhaps mistaken?" I feigned ignorance, never dismissing the possibility of a ploy. 
Of course, the Duke remained unmoved. 
"Hearing the honorific makes me feel awkward. I still vividly remember your appearance on the day you received your title."
"...Is Erwin the source of this misunderstanding?" 
"I understand your position, so I won't fault you for lying in front of me. But..."
The Duke, visible through the crystal orb, leaned back from his chair, resting his elbows on the desk.
"To engage in a proper dialogue, we need to create a situation you can't deny."
A situation I couldn't deny? 
Could he be planning to use a verification spell or some numbered item like the Misaligned Trust? Or perhaps torture? I meticulously explored every possibility, maintaining a poker face, but my predictions proved to be entirely wrong.
"First, let me tell you this."
The Duke's chosen weapon was "dialogue."
"Baron Jandel, be at ease. I'm one of the few who knows you're not an Evil Spirit."
Oh, you're going for the jugular right from the start. 
***
Amelia's initial shock upon discovering my true nature wasn't about how I could possibly be an Evil Spirit, but rather how I managed to receive a noble title.
"...Hm, thinking back, the royal family might have known and simply turned a blind eye. You were a hero in the city at that time."
Amelia had made that assumption then, and I found it somewhat plausible. But...
"If what the Duke just said is true, it means he really didn't know." 
Of course, there's also the possibility that the Duke knew all along and was simply setting a trap. 
But for now, I decided to listen in silence. Sometimes, a defensive stance is more advantageous than a preemptive strike. It's not too late to make a judgment and act after I hear everything.
"Baron Björn Jandel and Ríhen Suíths. I won't delve into the similarities between these two explorers. Is that alright?"
"Yes, well, I've actually been mistaken for him a few times..."
As I nodded, the Duke elaborated on his reasons for believing I was Baron Jandel.
"It was easy to figure out that you weren't Ríhen Suíths. I heard the whole story from the employee who accidentally damaged and discarded your files."
Some woman had approached and threatened him, right? That's when my suspicions deepened. 
"At first, I thought it was nonsense. But do you know what's most important in administrative work? Seeing only the numbers. No matter how logical or plausible the story, if the numbers don't match, it's a lie."
"That's precisely your case."
Björn Jandel is dead. 
The moment that statement was challenged, every clue began to fall into place, the Duke said.
"You were too strong to be Baron Björn Jandel. But if given two years and support, it was entirely plausible."
"Then how did you manage to hide from our eyes for all that time? That would make sense if you hadn't stayed in this city."
If not in this city, then where?
The answer was obvious. 
"When you disappeared on Falune Island, you had contact with those from Noirark, right?"
Too coincidental to be a coincidence. 
Furthermore, investigations revealed that two years later, I reappeared in the now-closed underground fortress. The very same fortress rumored to have a path connecting to the outside walls.
"After the Blood Countess visited that place, you appeared."
Now I see, the knight didn't just burst into our house and accuse us of treason for no reason. At the time, I simply thought it was an excuse. 
"Now, tell me your thoughts after hearing my story."
The Duke, peering at me through the crystal orb, grinned.
I certainly couldn't deny that it was a convincing story. 
Actually, it made more sense than the idea of me traveling back in time for two years.
But...
"Oh..."
My only thought after hearing the long story was this:
It seems like he genuinely believes this, not a trap.
"Should I call this exceptional imagination, or a lack thereof...?"
So, it could be interpreted this way.
***
My time for deliberation was short. I always make it a habit to prioritize my goals.
First priority: Our survival. 
Second priority: Reclaiming my identity as Björn Jandel.
Third priority: Clearing the charges of being an Evil Spirit.
I set these priorities on my way here. Therefore...
"You are sharp, even for a Chancellor."
I shed the mask of Ríhen Suíths and revealed myself as a Barbarian. 
A simple reason.
As I said before, regaining the name Björn Jandel is more important than clearing the charges of being an Evil Spirit. It doesn't matter if they think I'm an Evil Spirit or a traitor. 
This is a problem that can be solved with a negotiation with the Duke.
"He wouldn't have summoned me here if he intended to kill me for being a traitor."
"Yes, I am Björn Jandel. Long time no see, Duke."
I've realized that words hold power.  Or else, there's no way I could be exuding this confidence, having shed the mask of humanity. 
Ah, I feel like I can breathe again.
"Haha, good. If you had denied it here as well, it would have been a real nuisance."
I chuckled at the Duke's words, laced with a hint of sarcasm.
"A nuisance..."
In fact, that was why I revealed myself so readily. The next step wouldn't be "dialogue" but "items."  
If he realized those "items" wouldn't work on me, where the arrow would fly was clear as day. 
Erwin, Amelia, Raven.  If he interrogated them thoroughly, the truth behind this ridiculous misunderstanding would come out in time. 
It's better to admit it coolly and get to the main point.  
Besides, tricking others has become my specialty.
"Alright, now we're getting down to business."
The Duke, finally ending the chit-chat, lowered his voice.
"Baron Jandel, what's your reason for siding with Noirark?"
"Well, does it matter?"
"Such an uncooperative attitude isn't good. You're a clever friend, aren't you?"
"There's nothing to say about siding. I merely stayed there temporarily for my purpose."
"..."
The Duke stared silently at me with an enigmatic gaze. 
But I kept my shoulders squared, unwavering.  
It wasn't a complete lie, after all. I did travel back in time and stay in Noirark. For six months, no less. 
And I even cracked the Baron's head open in the end.
"It doesn't seem like a lie..."
"Burp."
"..."
"Ah, sorry. I had some air trapped." 
It wasn't intentional. My stomach had been feeling queasy since earlier.
"Seems like you were tense as well."
Was it because of the sudden hiccup that shifted the mood slightly? 
The Duke didn't press further and moved on.
"Anyway, can we understand that you're not with them now?"
"Of course."
"That still doesn't quite make sense. If you're not a spy, why did you hide your identity?"
"The royal family declared me an Evil Spirit first. I intended to investigate their motives for doing so before clearing my name."
"So, you were wary of us... I see, that's possible."
The Duke nodded slightly, and it was finally my turn.
It's more enjoyable to have a back-and-forth with questions, isn't it?
"So, since we're on the subject, why did they make that declaration? If you were the Duke, surely you would know the reason."
"I can't tell you the details. Just assume it was for political reasons. Besides, we didn't know you were alive, did we?"
Ah, this was the part I was most curious about, but I didn't get the most crucial piece of information. 
It would be a lie to say I wasn't disappointed, but I moved on to the next question without dwelling on it.
"Well, then tell me this. What do you want from me? If you really thought I was a traitor, you wouldn't have brought me here. You should have just assassinated me."
"The royal family doesn't work that way."
Bullshit. They don't work that way, huh?
Just a visit to the palace and you're reeking of every kind of grime imaginable.
"So, you're saying you want nothing from me?"
"Actually, if you were a spy, we were planning to persuade you and use you in the war."
See, there it is, right out of the gate. 
"Then it's a pity."
"Well, is it really a pity? I think the current situation isn't bad at all."
"Not bad at all?"
"Wars always need heroes."
Oh, so when you declared me an Evil Spirit, that wasn't the plan?
His brazenness, stating such a blatant lie without a flicker of emotion, was baffling, but then again, that's how he got to his position.
"Baron Björn Jandel, return to the embrace of the royal family."
"Why should I?"
"Because you need us."
"Well, I don't know about that."
When I pushed back again, the Duke revealed his true intentions.
"Whether you cut ties with Noirark or not, it's a fact that you were with them.  We could execute you on the spot without any issues."
"In other words, you'll let it go if I join you?"
"Not just letting it go. We'll help you regain your noble title and even your original name."
"What about the declaration that I'm an Evil Spirit?"
"If there's a plausible story, people will believe it."
It seemed like the Duke had already visualized how this would be implemented...
"Didn't you say you stayed in Noirark for a while to achieve your goals? If you have emotional reservations, consider it a business deal."
My feelings were mixed. 
Or rather, I felt a bit uneasy. 
I came here prepared for the worst-case scenario, ready to walk into the lion's den.
"Is this even possible...?"
This whole situation was unfolding so favorably for me that my heart started racing, and a sense of unease settled in.
But...
"Baron Jandel, if you've made your decision, let me have your answer."
The choices before me were limited. Even if the Duke and the royal family were plotting something sinister, what else could I do here?
I'll agree here and figure it out on my own later.
"Alright. Tell me the details. How will you return my title, and what do you want in return?"
The Duke, satisfied with my agreement, nodded.
However, just as he was about to speak, a loud roar echoed from the garden.
"Good heavens, it seems she has arrived. I didn't expect her to act so recklessly."
It's Erwin, then.
"We'll continue this conversation later. You'll have to calm her down before things get any more chaotic."
"...Fine."
And thus, that day's conversation ended.
