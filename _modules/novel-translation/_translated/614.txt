##  Chapter 614: Homunculus (1)
Test tubes filled with green nutrient solution. Dozens of Doppelgangers huddled inside, their eyes fixed on me. It wasn't a coincidence. One blinked, its pupils tracking my every movement.
"…"Alive, aren't they?" 
The sight was grotesque, enough to make even a modern person flinch. But...
"What're you looking at?"
Having inhabited a Barbarian's body and overcome countless trials, modern sensibilities were no longer a concern. Not entirely, of course.
"Never seen a Barbarian before?"
I'd say it's about as jarring as truffle oil in a dish, wouldn't you? I swept my gaze around, then moved forward. 
Thud, thud. 
Their gazes followed as I walked down the corridor, but I barely paid them any mind. After all, there's no creature on Earth more grotesque than a Corpse Golem. My Barbarian's body remained unyielding, moving with uncaring grace.
Thump.
The end of the corridor came into view. Another room sat at its end, and I cautiously pushed open the door, revealing a space resembling a laboratory. In the center, a massive test tube stood like a pillar, filled with green nutrient solution.
Shhh.
Turning my head, I saw a bookshelf. It spanned one entire wall, overflowing with thick, ancient tomes.
"Dead end?"
Hoping for a clue, I flipped through every book, but none contained a single written word. They were mere decorative pieces.
"Well, this isn't new…"
Empty books were a common sight in my dungeon-crawling days. That's why the ones with content often fetched high prices in the city, like the 'Necronomicon' found in the Crimson Citadel.
"Wait… what's this?"
Pulling my focus away from the bookshelf, I approached the center of the lab. In front of the colossal test tube, filled with nothing but nutrient solution, sat an enigmatic lever. In a game, it would be an interaction button begging to be pressed. I couldn't resist.
Click, clunk!
I pulled the lever with moderate force, and it slid smoothly to its end. And then, simultaneously…
Flash!
Light erupted from the test tube. It wasn't blindingly bright, but when the light faded, something had materialized within the nutrient solution.
'Doppelganger.'
The creature trapped in the test tube in the corridor. A Doppelganger spontaneously appearing just from pulling a lever was intriguing, but that was all. It's not like it couldn't happen in this world, after all. My attention shifted elsewhere.
'If the left lever creates them… what does the right one do?'
I extended my hand towards the other lever. Come on, I couldn't possibly resist.
Click, clunk!
Barbarian style, I pulled it decisively. And…
Flash!
Light erupted from the test tube, just as before. Only the results were completely different.
'It vanished.'
The Doppelganger disappeared without a trace as the light subsided.
'Is this a delete button?'
I don't know for sure. Maybe it teleports them somewhere. Regardless, it's not particularly important right now.
"So what exactly is this place?"
The biggest question I had after witnessing the effects of both levers. A creation lever and a deletion lever. I understood that much. But why was this place hidden underground? And how did I even find it?
This wasn't just some hidden area for me to play with levers alone, was it…?
"Hmm."
Thinking back, there were similar hidden areas, not quite hidden areas, in 'Dungeon & Stone'. Aren't there in other online RPGs too? Where you find a dropped notebook or note, and reading it reveals someone's story. Sometimes, hidden quests start from such things. Ultimately, their purpose is to naturally reveal the game's lore.
If this is the case…
'Are they trying to give me a clue about the truth of these races being artificially created?'
That's the only thing I can think of. I had already guessed the truth about the races' origins before coming here, but that was just luck. If not for that conversation with the vampire gentleman, I never would have arrived at that conclusion.
'…Maybe this place really does exist for that purpose?'
There's another reason this hypothesis feels plausible. The basement feels different, doesn't it? The more I explore, the stronger it becomes. A feeling that something unseen is guiding me, whispering secrets.
'Anyway, it'd be a shame if this was all there was to it…'
I detached myself from the lever and searched the room thoroughly. Despite my efforts, I found nothing of significance. There was only one thing left unchecked.
"Sigh…"
I sighed, staring at the colossal test tube filled with green nutrient solution. Even for a Barbarian, a symbol of bravado, this problem was a dilemma. There was nothing left but that test tube.
'If I smash it… will something come out?'
If I were playing a game, I'd press the attack button. Even if it was irreversible, I'd be satisfied with the information gained and reload. 'Dungeon & Stone' was that kind of game, after all. But…
'You can't know anything without trying.'
I pondered, but it didn't take long to make a decision.
Ting!
I flipped a 100-stone coin I had from the city with my thumb. Heads, I'd flip it again. Tails, I'd smash the test tube with a hammer.
Roll, roll, roll.
The coin rolled to a stop, revealing its fate. Tails.
'Okay, no guilt trip necessary.'
I swung the hammer without hesitation, aiming for the test tube's glass. I was worried about a 'unbreakable' option, but thankfully, the test tube was no different from ordinary glass. It shattered with a *clink*.
Caaarashhhh!
The green liquid poured out through the cracks in the broken glass. I wasn't sure what it was, so I climbed onto a desk to avoid getting splashed. It did get on me a bit when I smashed it with the hammer, but the affected area didn't sting.
Thud.
The liquid that soaked the floor quickly disappeared, as if there was a drain underneath. Only then did I climb down from the desk and approach the test tube. And…
Grin.
I smiled, looking at the mysterious stone buried among the glass shards.
'I knew there'd be something.'
Of course, I've been playing this game for years. The cracks radiating out from the stone, as if magma flowed within, clearly indicate that this is no ordinary item.
Shhh.
I bent down and picked up the stone with my gloved hand. And…
"…"
I lost consciousness.
***
"The character has acquired the 'Philosopher's Stone'."
"The malignant gene encoded in the character's body is eliminated."
***
When I opened my eyes, the first thought that came to mind was one.
Hungry.
I felt a stronger hunger than ever before, leading to a question.
'How much time has passed?'
I couldn't possibly be this hungry from a moment of unconsciousness. I pushed myself up, using the floor as support. There were shards of glass everywhere, but thanks to my high physical resistance, they didn't hurt.
"…"
Everything around me remained unchanged. The test tube was shattered, and the bookshelf against the wall was still a mess from me pulling out the books. However, the only difference was…
"What the hell, where did it go?"
I searched high and low, but the stone was nowhere to be seen. I distinctly remember holding it as I lost consciousness. But it vanished like a bubble.
Two possibilities immediately came to mind.
1. Someone took the stone while I was unconscious.
2. It was a consumable item that activates upon acquisition.
I couldn't be sure which was true, but I judged the latter as more likely. 'Dungeon & Stone' wasn't entirely devoid of such items or events.
'The problem is that I have no way of knowing what effect it has…'
Is it a potion, a curse, or a buff? I couldn't know anything without being able to check my character log. There wasn't even a noticeable change to my body.
'How much time has actually passed?'
I put the stone out of my mind and checked my watch. The hour hand was about seven hours ahead of where I last saw it, but that wasn't reassuring. Explorer-exclusive, high-grade watches also show how many days have passed.
"No wonder I was hungry…"
I sighed as I realized over ten days had passed. Sigh, how much scolding would I get from my comrades when I go back?
Creak, creak.
I took my time, chewing on some dried meat to fill my stomach. Then I stood up, leaving the lab behind. Just as I had when I arrived, I was met by the Doppelgangers trapped in the test tubes, glaring at me.
It was thematically appropriate, so I wasn't particularly bothered. But…
'I have to smash these too, don't I?'
If a thought arises, action must follow. That's the Barbarian way. I crushed every test tube as I walked down the corridor, smashing the heads of every crawling Doppelganger.
However, aside from a slight alleviation of my frustration, I gained no substantial rewards.
"Ah, that was here too."
As I walked past the corridor, another opening leading downwards caught my eye. What could be down there?
'Might as well check this while I'm at it.'
Amelia would probably be furious, but she'd be equally furious if I returned now. So I went down the ladder and began to search.
It was similar to the bunker-like space I first entered. There was a straight passage, ending at a circular iron door. The only difference was that it wouldn't open, no matter how much I knocked, touched it, or yelled.
'…Maybe there's some condition for it to open. Wait, but why did the first door open immediately?'
I couldn't understand it, but there was nothing else to do here. So I climbed back up the ladder and returned the way I came. The time it took to reach the spot where the dimensional severance phenomenon occurred, the spot I blocked to prevent Amelia from following, was short. But…
"…"What the hell."
No one was there.
***
A bad feeling. I never dismiss such feelings as superstition or imagination. They say a bad feeling never lies, after all. In reality, bad feelings are often right.
Having that feeling means I was subconsciously aware of something. A discrepancy in the information I perceived through my eyes and ears.
Thump, thump!
My heart hammered in my chest. Someone, Amelia or anyone, should have been here. It was common for my comrades to wait anxiously when I recklessly disappeared as a Barbarian. 
But why was no one here now? Even if they moved, it would make sense to leave at least one person behind.
'Something must have happened.'
I quickly climbed up the ladder to the surface. But no one was there on the surface either, amidst the dense thicket of plants.
"Emily! Ainar! Raven! Misha…!!"
I yelled as loud as I could, but no one responded. It was too quiet. I even wondered if I was the only one left in this world.
Whatever the situation was, I needed to check the temple where the main group was located. As quickly as possible.
Da-da-da-dat.
I ran like I was possessed, and after a day, I reached the river I passed earlier. It was the biggest obstacle to reaching the temple. I didn't know if the river was harmless or not, but…
1. Barbarians can't swim.
2. The boat I controlled was completely wrecked in the rainy season and can't float.
3. I couldn't find the boat I left behind.
But this wasn't a desperate situation. I couldn't swim, but Barbarians could walk on water.
Like this.
Plunk!
I leaped as far as I could and dived, waiting for my body to sink all the way down and touch the bottom. And…
Woosh!
As soon as my feet touched the bottom, I used all the lung capacity I had and walked as fast as I could.
"Hooaaah!"
Damn, I thought I was going to die. I couldn't see anything, so I didn't even know if I was going the right way.
"Heave, heave…"
Finally crossing the river, I barely had time to shake off the murky water before running toward the temple.
