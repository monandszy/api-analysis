            "text": "## Chapter 733: The Jester (2)\n\nAs soon as the battle commenced, Avet Necrapeto retreated to the relatively safe rear. His innate desire for attention had led him to recklessly charge at the forefront during the 9th District invasion, but he was not about to repeat the same mistake. He was confident in his close combat abilities, to a certain extent, but...\n\n“How can I possibly stand in front of these monsters?”\n\nHis close combat skills were essentially self-defense tactics, and even those were useless against them. It wasn't just skill, it was a matter of professional difference.\n\n\"Don't hide back there! You goddamn—\"\n\nA former comrade, a woman, yelled at him as he moved back. \n\nSuch insults were insignificant, even a compliment of sorts among people like them.\n\n“Heh, what a ridiculous statement! Why is it hiding when a summoner retreats?”\n\nIt was an obvious move, but the woman who was captured by the enemy for failing to do it screamed in frustration.\n\n\"You goddamn— If you hadn’t done that back then, I would have... I would have…\"\n\n\"Heh, but thanks to you, we forged a good connection, didn't we?\"\n\n\"Are you kidding me?!\"\n\nTheir argument had the potential to continue for days if they had the time, but unfortunately, the situation was not favorable. They were on opposite sides of the battlefield, far from each other.\n\n\"Stop bickering and use some magic!\"\n\n\"...Alright, alright!\"\n\n\"Necrapeto!\"\n\n\"Heh...\"\n\nTheir argument naturally ended as they both participated in supporting the battle from the rear. It was a relief for him.\n\n“Rilanne Vivienne has cast the 4th grade Black Magic [Rotten Earth's Curse].”\n“All enemies within range will have their defense greatly reduced.”\n\nThat stupid woman was nothing more than a curse-caster, but he was different.\n\n“Heh, a pathetic attempt.”\n\n“Avet Necrapeto has cast [Legion's Blessing].”\n“All allies within range will have their harmful effects reduced by 50%, and their highest stat will increase by 20%.”\n\nHe had recently acquired a 2nd grade area buff.\n\n“Damn it! Layton’s dead! Necrapeto!”\n\n\"Heh, leave it to me!\"\n\nUnlike the Black Magician whose magic was mediocre except for curses, Necromancers had skills that were insanely powerful even in small-scale battles.\n\n\"Avet Necrapeto has cast [Puppet].”\n\nNecromancers could revive dead consumable items to fight. \n\nThey weren't as strong as they were in life, but…\n\n…they become quite usable with a couple of buffs.\n\n“Avet Necrapeto has cast [Bloodline].”\n“All passive skills possessed by the caster will be bestowed upon the minion.”\n\nTheir blood flows with poison, their bones become harder, and all their attacks inflict debuffs.\n\nBut that wasn’t all.\n\n“Avet Necrapeto has cast [Modification].”\n“One minion will be randomly modified.”\n\nThe Orculis elite, with the skills worthy of being summoned here...\n\n...immediately resurrected upon death, gaining a random trait.\n\nFor example...\n\n“Grand Success.”\n“Minion: Coral Layton has acquired the [Giant Beast] trait.”\n\nCoral Layton, who was a melee warrior, transformed into a massive monster upon resurrection, comparable to that Barbarian.\n\n\"Heh, grand success from the start, what good luck.”\n\nKwaaang-!\n\nA new summon (Coral Layton), possessing even greater strength than in life, confronted the Giant Barbarian.\n\n\"Heh, heh, heh… Such a strength stat, enough to hold back that brute Barbarian!\"\n\nNecrapeto genuinely hoped his newly created summon would survive.\n\nSuch a creature stat would be among the top in his collection of extradimensional...\n\nSserok-!\n\n“...Huh?”\n\nHe rubbed his eyes, watching the battle from the rear.\n\nKuung-!\n\n…It died with a single slash?\n\n“A… Grand Success? And with the best base?”\n\nHe couldn’t understand.\n\nThere was a dealer next to that Barbarian, supposedly very strong, and even seeing him kill Layton with a single strike, he thought it was best to stay away…!\n\nBut this was ridiculous!\n\n“...What kind of goddamn knight is that?!”\n\nHe may have been the one who spoke for everyone, but it was the thought shared by all the Orculis members present. It was only natural.\n\nEven a Necromancer like him, with slow reflexes and no expertise in melee combat, could sense it. Those who were directly fighting in front were surely feeling it even more.\n\nSserok-!\n\nThis nameless knight was dangerous.\n\nNot in some ways, but in every way.\n\nEven more so than that Barbarian, who was called “Giant.”\n\nPsheuuut-!\n\nA geyser of blood erupted with every swing of his blade.\n\nTwenty elite soldiers who had been eagerly waiting.\n\nAnd hundreds of support troops stationed around them.\n\n“... ”\n\n“... ”\n\nUnconsciously, they were retreating, no longer actively participating in the battle.\n\nThey were all too preoccupied with protecting themselves, weren’t they?\n\nA common phenomenon during a battle with a bleak outlook. \n\nThey only pretended to fight until the retreat order came…\n\n“...I… I need to prepare.”\n\nAvet Necrapeto, who had lived a life of strength over weakness, sensed that ‘atmosphere’ faster than anyone else, picturing his escape in his mind.\n\nBut of course, he couldn’t run away right now.\n\nIt was because the order to retreat hadn’t come yet.\n\n“Let’s pretend to help for a while… ”\n\nHe would run away the moment the opportunity arose, without looking back.\n\nJust in case, he’d retreat further first.\n\n“Avet Necrapeto has cast [Puppet].”\n\nHe didn’t hesitate to use his support skills.\n\nHe had to do his part to have something to say even after the retreat, and if he didn’t, the front line would crumble.\n\nBut…\n\n“…What?”\n\nHis judgment was sound, but it was also a major mistake.\n\nThe moment the new [Puppet] rose,\n\n…the knight’s gaze fell upon Necrapeto.\n\nMechanical, indifferent eyes, shining like a hunter’s.\n\n“Why, why is he looking at me?!”\n\nHe screamed silently in his heart, terrified, but he knew why the knight was looking at him.\n\nHe knew the moment he saw it.\n\nThe knight’s thought as he looked at him.\n\n‘Oh, I need to kill him quickly.’\n\nThe knight's gaze held no ill will or annoyance.\n\nThat was precisely why he felt chills running down his spine.\n\nTherefore…\n\nThuk.\n\nHe involuntarily took a step back.\n\nTadat-!\n\nAs if it were a signal flare, the knight leaped into the air.\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"Just borrowing you for a bit.\"\n\nThe knight, having leaped high into the air, lightly stepped on the giant Barbarian's shoulder, and using that momentum, flew toward him in a single breath.\n\n“... ”\n\nIt was a strange sensation.\n\nAs if time were slowing down.\n\nEven as the knight rapidly approached him, his mind spun faster than ever before.\n\nTo find a way to survive.\n\n‘Momentary Immortality.’\n\nIt didn’t seem like a good idea.\n\nIt might make him invincible for a minute, but…\n\nWould he survive after that?\n\n“I… I shouldn’t have come here! Why the hell does this always happen when I encounter that Barbarian?!”\n\nHe was overwhelmed by a sense of injustice and sorrow, but he quickly cleared his mind.\n\nSuch thoughts wouldn’t help him survive.\n\nYes, so…\n\n“...Damn it!”\n\nNecrapeto put his most likely survival plan into action, conceived in a moment of thought.\n\n“Avet Necrapeto has used the [Staff of the Underworld].”\n\nThe Staff of the Underworld.\n\nIt was a divine weapon, a top-tier item among Double Numbers, ranked No. 17, and truly a ‘Necromancer’s’ graduation item.\n\nIt was a risky weapon in many ways…\n\n‘Call of the Underworld.’\n\nNecrapeto didn’t hesitate to activate the staff's ability, ‘Call of the Underworld.’\n\nOf course, he chose the most manageable, and he hoped it would be enjoyable to torment…\n\n‘Rilanne Vivienne!’\n\nThe moment he completed the target designation with a determined glare, the aura that had been approaching disappeared, and green light swirled.\n\n\"The character and designated target are receiving the Call of the Underworld.”\n\nThe realm of the dead, where no one from the outside can interfere.\n\n‘Heh, I’d say it was a wise choice.’\n\nNow he just had to hold on, just hold on.\n\nWell, it might get boring, but… he could just keep her entertained to prevent her from dying.\n\n…That’s what he thought.\n\n“Wow, the scenery here is killer.”\n\n…Until he saw a Barbarian calmly looking around.\n\n***\n“The character has used [Aegis Barrier].”\n“The designated target will receive the effect instead.”\n***\n\nThree crescent moons of green color hung in the sky.\n\nThey looked so vivid and close as if he was in space. \n\nIf you looked closely, you could see that the moons were made of writhing corpses.\n\n[Groooooaaarrrrr…]\n\nZombie-like sounds filled the air like background music.\n\nThe ground was just a bleak, arid plain extending endlessly…\n\nPhooong-!\n\nGreen something shot up from the crack in the earth like magma erupting.\n\n‘If I get hit by that, the debuff stacks, right? I’ll have to be careful.’\n\nSo this is what it feels like.\n\nIt’s definitely different from what I saw in the game.\n\nMaybe it's because the lighting itself is green, coming from the sky, but it really feels like I’ve come to a different world.\n\n‘Anyway, I'm done sightseeing.’\n\nYou can’t have your cake and eat it too, so I wasn’t going to spend my time sightseeing when I have things to do.\n\nTherefore…\n\nSsuuk.\n\nAs I shifted my gaze from my surroundings to directly ahead, the creature I made eye contact with flinched.\n\n“Bi, Biyoorn Yandell! Why… are you here?!”\n\nYou see, if you use the active skill of [Aegis Barrier], it can intercept ‘target designation’ type instant skills that are normally immune to interception or replacement.\n\nIt’s my first time using it in a real battle, but…\n\n“Well?”\n\nThere’s no need to explain it to him—\n\n“Bu… but I clearly designated Vivienne that bitch?!”\n\nOh… It wasn’t Raven?\n\nI thought so, so I used my shield without asking, without any doubts.\n\n‘Well, they were both in similar positions.’\n\nIt was a misunderstanding, but it wasn’t a bad situation.\n\nThe Corpse Collector, Avet Necrapeto.\n\nI wanted to kill him myself.\n\nSsiik.\n\nI smiled and raised my hammer."
